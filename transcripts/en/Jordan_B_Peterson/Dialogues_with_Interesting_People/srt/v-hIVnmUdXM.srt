1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,190
Yeah,

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,280
I've really been trying to understand 
the underlying psychology of 

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,721
postmodernism and its relationship with 
neo Marxism and then the spread of that 

4
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:30,841
into the universities and the effect on 
the culture and what I would like to 

5
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,510
start with is a description of your 
understanding of that because our,

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,100
like I've presented to the people who 
are listening to me,

7
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:41,101
my understanding of it.
I interviewed Steven Hicks recently and 

8
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:41,620
he wrote an interesting book called 
explaining postmodernism,

9
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,520
which I liked quite a bit.
It's been criticized for being too right

10
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:50,521
wing,
although I don't think he's right wing 

11
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,351
at all.
I think maybe you could characterize 

12
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,040
them as middle of the road conservative,
but I would say he's more like a classic

13
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:59,041
liberal,
but I'm really curious about your views 

14
00:00:59,041 --> 00:00:59,560
about what,
what,

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,440
what postmodernism is.
First of all,

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,810
I know you've,
you've identified it with the,

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,960
with the general tricksters,
Duroda and Latina and Sukkot and 

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,240
football in particular you've talked 
about,

19
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:15,241
but I'd like to know what you think 
about postmodernism and also why you 

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,510
think it's been so attractive to people.

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
Well,
my explanation is that there is no 

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,041
authentic 19 sixties point of view in 
any of the elite universities.

23
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,670
Okay.
But rather,

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,860
the most liberated minds of my 
generation were 1960.

25
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:34,110
It did not go onto graduate school.
I witnessed with my own eyes.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,300
I saw genuine marxists.
Okay.

27
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:41,301
At my college,
which was the State University of New 

28
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:41,301
York at Binghamton,
upstate New York,

29
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:46,221
a Harper College,
which had a huge cohort of very radical 

30
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:48,560
downstate New York Jews.
Okay.

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,500
Who,
in fact,

32
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,630
the Harper,
what we used to be called Berkeley East.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,740
So I saw genuine,
passionate marxists with my own eyes.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,160
They were not word choppers at.
They were not snide postmodernists,

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,350
right?
They weren't in your face aggressive.

36
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,720
They use the language of the people.
They had a populist energy.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,530
Hey,
they dressed working class.

38
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,180
There were non materialistic.
Hey,

39
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,730
these are people who lived by their own 
convictions.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,490
They were against the graduate school.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,900
So when I,
when I,

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,140
uh,
went onto graduate school and it became 

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,351
known that I was going to go to Yale,
I was confronted by a leader of the 

44
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,951
radicals on campus or in broad daylight 
in front of everyone who denounced me 

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
for Grad school is not where it's 
happening.

46
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,280
You don't,
you don't do that.

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,430
If you have to go to graduate school,
you should go to buffalo now.

48
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:43,431
And I had applied to these students to 
suny buffalo because the great leftist 

49
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,220
critic,
Leslie fiedler was there.

50
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,930
What a huge impact on me.
He's right.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,700
He created,
created identity politics,

52
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,790
but without its present distortions,
uh,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,300
and Norman Holland,
the second one,

54
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:57,301
little critic was there.
I will be very happy to have gone onto 

55
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:57,301
buffalo,
but I needed the library again.

56
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:57,760
So I continued on to.
Yeah,

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,080
the word no in the,
in the graduate schools from 1968 to 72 

58
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,990
when I was there were only one radical 
todd Gitlin.

59
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,970
Okay.
Went on to have a career success.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
Okay.
The actual radicals of the 19 sixties,

61
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,130
right.
Either when off dropped out of college 

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,850
and went off to create commune.
So I or they were taking acid and 

63
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,630
destroyed their brains.
Now I have also written about that,

64
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,570
the destruction of the of the minds.
Okay.

65
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,320
I'll for the most talented members of my
generation through Lsd,

66
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,321
it was going on all around me towards 
what's happened is the actual legacy of 

67
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:38,911
the sixties got truncated.
The idea that these poststructuralist 

68
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:43,281
and postmodernist are heirs of the 1960 
[inaudible] revolution is an absolute 

69
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,070
crock.
Okay.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,800
What they represent as Fuko shows,
shows Fuko said,

71
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,710
okay,
the biggest influence on on his thinking

72
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,520
was Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot.
Okay.

73
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,300
Which was a post World War Two play 
written in Paris.

74
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:03,301
That was about the disillusionment and 
nihilism experienced after Hitler went 

75
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:07,890
through occupied France and all of 
Europe was in ruins and had nothing to 

76
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:07,900
do.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,270
Waiting for Godot has nothing to do with
the authentic legacy of the 19 sixties,

78
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,820
which was about genuine 
multiculturalism,

79
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,690
a movement toward India.
Hinduism.

80
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,790
I a transformation of consciousness 
through psychedelics,

81
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,600
which I take but which identify with 
totally through the music,

82
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,420
etc.
Right?

83
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,590
It was a turn toward the body.
It was a tuRn towards sensory 

84
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,590
experience.
Okay.

85
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm not this,
this word shopping thing and this 

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,620
cynical removal from an actual 
experience that french import.

87
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,640
Okay.
Came in.

88
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,990
Okay.
To the graduate school,

89
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,230
it did not affect any genuine 19 sixties
person.

90
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,650
The real 19 sixties revolution was about
young.

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
It was about a way of seeing the cosmos 
in mythological terms and the union 

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,180
contribution went on into the new age 
movement of the 19 seventies.

93
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,390
Aside from the universities.
So who took over the universities were 

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,490
these careerists hey,
I saw them with my own eyes.

95
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,300
I saw what happened.
I thought I was at yale when derrida was

96
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:13,240
being shipped over to,
to address the,

97
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:13,590
uh,
you know,

98
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,620
the,
the student is around students and the 

99
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,431
faculty.
And I said to a fellow student after 

100
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,590
hearing one of these guys speak.
It wasn't dairy die.

101
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,400
It was,
it wasn't another one of the theorists.

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,580
I said,
they are like high priests murmuring to 

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,650
each other.
This,

104
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,040
this was an elitist form from the start.
Okay.

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,580
It was not progressive.
It was not revolutionary.

106
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,810
It was reactionary.
It was a desperate attempt to hold on to

107
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:45,811
what had happened before.
The 19 sixties sensory revolution was 

108
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:46,490
this postmodernist thing.
Okay.

109
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,160
This trashing.
Okay.

110
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,860
Of of the text.
This is this,

111
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,810
this encouragement.
Okay.

112
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:57,811
Have a superior and destructive attitude
toward the work of art that we're going 

113
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:57,890
through.
It's okay.

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,900
Primly with red pen in hand.

115
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,290
Finding all the evidence of sexism.
Check racism,

116
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,680
check homophobia.
Check.

117
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,650
That is not the empathic emotional.
Okay.

118
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,490
Sensory based.
Okay.

119
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,660
A revolution of the 19 sixties I,
I am sick and tired of these people 

120
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,910
claiming any kind of mental from the 19 
sixties.

121
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,830
They're frauds.
These people are.

122
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,890
What happened in the 19 seventies was a 
collapse of the job market in academia.

123
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,130
All of a sudden those jobs were scarce 
and this thing was there.

124
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:32,100
The new and improved and shiny thing to 
be a fearless.

125
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,300
People seized on it.
It was institutionalized and it's an 

126
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,390
enormous betrayal of the 1960 
[inaudible].

127
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Can you.
You touched on this idea of the 

128
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,880
destruction of the work of art.
You know,

129
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,881
and one of the things I really liked 
about reading nature was his discussion 

130
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,800
of resolved them all right,
of resentment and,

131
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,310
and it seems to me that a tremendous 
amount of the motive power that drives 

132
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,460
the postmodernist,
let's call it,

133
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,390
it's not a revolution.
Um,

134
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,460
transformation seems to me to be driven 
by resentment about virtually anything 

135
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,090
that has any.
Well,

136
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:11,091
what would you say?
Any merIt of competence or aesthetic 

137
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:11,340
quality.
And I don't know if that's,

138
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,790
it seems to me that that's partly rooted
in the academics.

139
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:19,791
Disdain for the business world,
which I think is driven by their 

140
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,211
relative economic inequality because 
most people who are as intelligent as 

141
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:27,501
academics are from a pure iq point of 
view make more money in the private 

142
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,590
sphere.
And so I think that drives some of it.

143
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,890
but there also seems to be this.
There's a destruction on aim for 

144
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,610
destruction of the,
of the aesthetic quality of the,

145
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,670
of the literary or artistic work.
It's reduction to nothing but some kind 

146
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,500
of power game.
And then surrounding that,

147
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,980
the reduction of everything to something
that approximates a power gate,

148
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,280
which,
which I can't help but identifying with 

149
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,530
jealousy and resentment as a,
as a fundamental motivator.

150
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,200
Does that seem reasonable to you?

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Professors?
Okay.

152
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,810
Who allege at art is nothing but an 
ideological movement by one elite,

153
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,500
a against the against another group,
right?

154
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,090
These people are philistines the 
philistines.

155
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,760
They're middlebrow,
hopelessly middlebrow,

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,950
or they.
They have no sense of beauty.

157
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,540
They have no sense of the aesthetic.
Now,

158
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:22,541
marxism doesn't need a search.
This moccasin tries to reconfigure the 

159
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:27,641
universe in terms of materialism.
It says it does not recognize any kind 

160
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,810
of spiritual dimension.
Now I'm an atheist,

161
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,020
but I see the great world religions as 
enormous works of art as the,

162
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:40,841
as the,
as the best way to understand the 

163
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:43,061
universe and man's place in it.
I find them enOrmously moving that 

164
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:43,870
they're there.
They're like enormous pole,

165
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,600
and I and I would,
I have called for the true revolution.

166
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,630
Okay.
Would have been okay to make the core 

167
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,170
currIculum of world education the world.
Okay.

168
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,390
The great religions of the world feel 
that is the only way to achieve an 

169
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,460
understanding and it's also a way to,
to,

170
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,750
to present the aesthetic.

171
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,100
Okay.
Because I feel that,

172
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,300
that the,
that the real sixties' vision was about 

173
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,300
xcel,
taishan,

174
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,130
elevation,
cosmic consciousness.

175
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,420
So I,
all of these things were rejected.

176
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,380
Okay.
By these,

177
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,360
by these midgets.
Okay.

178
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,270
Intellectual midgets who seized onto 
lecan,

179
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,320
derrida and fuko.
Right.

180
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,320
It's an and my career has been in the 
art school.

181
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,380
So I made my entire career beginning of 
anything college.

182
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,350
Uh,
so I,

183
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,730
I represent a challenge to this from the
perspective of art.

184
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,310
It is an absolute nonsense.
Okay.

185
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:36,990
As post structuralism maintains that 
reality is mediated by language,

186
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,520
by words.
Everything that we can know,

187
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,140
including gender is absolutely madness 
because I'm,

188
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,910
I'm teaching students whose majors are 
ceramics.

189
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,650
Okay.
Our dance.

190
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Okay.
Who are jazz musicians who understand 

191
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,880
reality in terms of the body.
It's sensory activation.

192
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,670
So now what?
See,

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,050
what happened was something was going on
in the art world as well.

194
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,840
I identify with andy warhol and pop art.
Okay.

195
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,720
That was what was going on during my 
years in college.

196
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,870
Everything about andy warhol was like,
wow,

197
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,640
admiration.
Wow.

198
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,300
What happened immediately after that in 
the arts?

199
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,360
Nineteen seventies.
okay.

200
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,410
Was this collapse into a snide sort of 
postmodernism?

201
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:21,411
also?
This happened in the art world and it 

202
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:22,680
was an utter misunderstanding of 
culture.

203
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:27,681
It seems to me by that movement in the 
art world that is a oppositional art,

204
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,700
in my view,
is dead.

205
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,410
Okay.
It's been this what?

206
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:36,411
Postmodernism is.
Isn't it pathetic attempt to continue 

207
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:40,250
the old hero as some of the avant garde?
The avant garde was genuinely heroic 

208
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,340
from the early 19th century.
Okay.

209
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,300
We,
we're talking about,

210
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,530
you know,
where the core bay,

211
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,620
the realist,
you know,

212
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
we're talking about monet and the 
impression is people who are genuinely 

213
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,700
suffered for their radical ideas and new
innovations and so on.

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I going right down to dirt to picasso 
and down to a to jackson pollack who 

215
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,710
was,
who truly suffered for his art.

216
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,540
It was only after his death.
Okay.

217
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,750
That suddenly the market was created for
abstract art.

218
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,700
Pop art killed the avant garde.
The idea that the avant garde continues.

219
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,400
It's an absolute delusion of the 
contemporary art world now,

220
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,530
which feels that it must attack attack,
attack,

221
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,610
challenge.
Okay.

222
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:15,280
The,
the,

223
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,420
the simplistic belief.
So the toy poodle.

224
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:18,860
Okay.
It's somehow the arctic.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,250
What?
Excuse me.

226
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:20,850
Okay.
All right.

227
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,200
From the moment.
Okay.

228
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:27,201
Andy warhol went through and embraced of
the popular media in britain instead of 

229
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,700
having the opposition to it,
the serious artists have had.

230
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,490
That was the end of oppositional art.
Okay,

231
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,800
so we had been going on now for 50 
years.

232
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,890
The postmodernism in academe is hand in 
hand with the stupidity and infantilism 

233
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,230
that masquerades as you know,
as as important art and galleries 

234
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,230
everywhere.

235
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,780
This incredible,
incredible,

236
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,960
you know,
it's mechanism oF contemporary art to 

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,750
pushing things that are,
that are so hopelessly derivative that 

238
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,760
with this idea that once again that the 
art world,

239
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:59,761
some houses a period of view of reality,
the authentic leftism is populist.

240
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,500
Okay?
It is based in working class style,

241
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,560
working class language,
working class direct emotion and an 

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,590
openness and brushing some speech.
Okay.

243
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,740
Not this fanCy,
contorted jargon of this pseudo leftists

244
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,040
of academe who are frauds.
These people,

245
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,690
these people who managed to manage to 
rise to the top and ended at berkeley at

246
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,070
harvard and princeton.
Okay.

247
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,860
Have any of These people are radical?
they are career people.

248
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,430
Their corporate types.
Okay.

249
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:29,020
The who like who succeeded in and they 
love the institutional contacts.

250
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,210
They know how to manipulate the 
bureaucracy,

251
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,430
which has totally invaded in usurped.
Okay.

252
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,410
The year they have an academe 
everywhere.

253
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,870
Okay.
These people are company pl players.

254
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,350
They could have done well in any,
any field and then they,

255
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,200
they love to sit in endless committees.
They love bureaucratic regulation and so

256
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,160
on.
There's not one,

257
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,470
not one leftist.
Okay.

258
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:52,270
And american academe raised his or her 
voice against obscene growth.

259
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Growth of tuition costs which have 
bankrupted a whole generation of young 

260
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,300
people.
Not,

261
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,420
not one voice.
Okay.

262
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,750
To challenge that.
That invasion by the bureaucrats.

263
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,630
Actual fascist bureaucrats.
Okay.

264
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,520
Well,
if it were for added,

265
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,120
they're like the cancerous.
okay.

266
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,130
There's so many of them because the 
faculty have completely lost any power 

267
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,390
in american academia.
Okay.

268
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,110
It's us.
It's a scandal.

269
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:19,111
What has happened and they deserve the 
president's servitude that they're in 

270
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:19,111
right now.
Okay.

271
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,910
Because they never protested when I my 
first job at bennington college,

272
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:26,911
1976,
I was there when there was an uprising 

273
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,761
by the faculty against encroachment,
by the board of trustees and the 

274
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:29,761
president.
okay.

275
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:30,430
And it was a huge thing.
It was,

276
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,460
it was,
it was reported on the New York times 

277
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,460
and so on.
And we.

278
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,460
And we pushed that precedent out.
Okay.

279
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,080
And,
and there's not been a single uprising 

280
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,080
of mankind against,
against encroachment,

281
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,640
by the trustees and by the 
administrations and all these decades.

282
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,380
Okay.
Pass them slaves.

283
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,360
Slaves.
They deserve their slavery.

284
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,080
Yup.
I couldn't agree more.

285
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,980
I thought the same thing about 
university professors for a long time is

286
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:56,850
that they get exactly what they deserve 
because they never stand up and say no.

287
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,930
And the fact that in the United States,
it's not quite as bad in Canada,

288
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:04,440
I wouldn't say,
but the fact that the students have been

289
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,590
essentially handed a bill of indentured 
servitude here for their student loans 

290
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,380
is absolutely beyond comprehension.
You know,

291
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:15,381
it seems to me that the bureaucracy has 
basically conspired to determine how to 

292
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:18,210
pick the pockets of the students' future
earnings.

293
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:23,211
Right.
And they do that by offering them an 

294
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:23,310
extended adolescence with no quality 
control,

295
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,010
something like that.
So it's a real bargain with the devil.

296
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,080
And,
and I told the abandonment of any kind 

297
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,080
of education actually in history and 
culture,

298
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,450
right?
They haven't going along with it.

299
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:36,530
That is the transformation into a 
cafeteria kind of a menu.

300
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:41,531
Okay.
We can pick this course or that course 

301
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,301
or this course without any kind of 
guidance from the university about a 

302
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,271
central core curriculum that teaches you
history and chronology and introduces 

303
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,480
you to the basics.
Because our professors are prima donnas.

304
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,850
They can only teach and their little 
areas.

305
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,780
So we have this total fragmentation.
Okay.

306
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,390
And the,
the,

307
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,510
the great art history survey courses are
being abandoned stedelijk because why?

308
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Because graduate students that are not 
trained to see the great narratives or 

309
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,510
the network because we are taught now 
that narratives are fault.

310
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,940
Okay.
So that's another issue that I'd like to

311
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:12,740
bring up because one of the things I 
cannot say grote is the alliance between

312
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:17,741
the postmodernists and the neo marxists.
I can't understand the causal 

313
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:21,260
relationship there because the.
Tell me if you disagree with this.

314
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,660
Okay.
Because I'm a psychologist,

315
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:28,661
not a sociologist,
and so I'm dabbling in things that are 

316
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,150
outside of my field of expertise and 
there is some danger in that,

317
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,480
but the,
the central postmodernist claim seems to

318
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:37,481
me that because there's a near incident 
number of ways to interpret a complex 

319
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:41,681
set of phenomena which,
which actually happens to be the case 

320
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:45,310
that you can't make a case that any of 
those modes of interpretation are 

321
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,271
canonical and so if they're not 
canonical and if that canonical element 

322
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,820
isn't based in some kind of reality than
it serves some other master.

323
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,930
And so The master that it hypothetically
serves for the postmodernists is nothing

324
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:59,750
but power because that seems to be 
everything that they believe it.

325
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,750
They don't believe in competence.
They don't believe in authority.

326
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,900
They don't seem to believe in an 
objective world because everything is 

327
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,691
language mediated.
So it's an extraordinarily cynical 

328
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:13,610
perspective that that because there's an
infinite number of interpretations,

329
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:18,611
none of them are canonical.
You can attribute it to everything to 

330
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:18,611
power and dominance.
Okay.

331
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,120
So that,
that seemed like a reasonable summary of

332
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,070
the radical.
It's a radical relativism now,

333
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,990
but the strange thing is despite.
Okay,

334
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:31,991
and so what goes along with that is the 
demolition of grand narratives and so 

335
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,720
that would be associated,
for example,

336
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,450
with the rejection of thinkers like 
young and Eric Norman,

337
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:40,451
because of course their foundational 
thinkers in relationship to the idea 

338
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:43,910
that there are embodied grand narratives
that's never touched.

339
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,930
But then despite the fact that the grand
narrative is rejected,

340
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:51,860
there's a neo marxism that's tightly,
tightly allied with postmodernism.

341
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,320
That also seems to shade into this 
strange identity.

342
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,140
Politics and I don't.
Two things.

343
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't understand the causal 
relationship there.

344
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:04,010
Like the skeptical part of me thinks 
that postmodernism was a,

345
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,250
was an intellectual.
It's intellectual camouflage for the 

346
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,001
continuation of the kind of pathological
marxism that produced the soviet union 

347
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,220
and that has no independent existence as
an intellectual field whatsoever.

348
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,580
But I still can't understand how the 
postmodernists to make the no grand 

349
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,471
narrative claim,
but then immerse themselves in this 

350
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:30,710
grand narrative without anyone pointing 
out the evident contradictions.

351
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,590
Like I don't understand that.
So what do you think about that?

352
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,700
well,
I can only speak about literary and 

353
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,080
professors really,
and they seem to me almost universally 

354
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,280
in theu ,
s to being very naive or they,

355
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,480
they,
they seemed to know nothing about actual

356
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,930
history,
political science or economics.

357
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,180
It's simply an attitude.
They have an attitude in marxism become 

358
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,880
simply a badge by which they telegraph 
their,

359
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,120
um,
their solidarity with the working class 

360
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,120
that they have nothing to do with.
Right.

361
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,840
I mean they literally nothing but 
contempt.

362
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,260
Yes.
And,

363
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,180
and the thing is that the campus left us
are almost notorious for their,

364
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,360
uh,
for their rather snobbish treatment of 

365
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,360
staff.
I mean,

366
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,121
they don't,
they don't have any rapport with the 

367
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:14,121
actual working class members of the,
um,

368
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,920
of the infrastructure,
the janitorial,

369
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,650
the janitors,
and even the,

370
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,700
even the secretaries,
there's was kind of high and mighty 

371
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:22,700
aristocracy,
you know,

372
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:22,980
about.
And they were just,

373
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,680
these are people who,
um,

374
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,780
who have wandered into the english 
department and our were products of a 

375
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,831
time when,
during the new criticism they were when 

376
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:38,240
history,
but history and psychology had been 

377
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,240
excluded.

378
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Me and my ambition.
Okay.

379
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,280
was,
I mean,

380
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,840
I love the new criticism.
okay.

381
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:42,540
As a,
as a style of textual analysis.

382
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,120
Right?
And,

383
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,130
and the,
and the new criticism had multiple 

384
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:48,130
interpretations.
Okay.

385
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,170
that were possible and that,
and they were encouraged.

386
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,840
In fact,
one of,

387
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,760
one of the great projects was made in 
max series 20th century views,

388
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,490
what you had at least books.
I adored them in college.

389
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:00,060
And it was about Jane Austin or above 
emily bronte or about,

390
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,760
um,
words worth and they were collections of

391
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:06,620
alternate views of the same thing.
The idea that no more,

392
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,990
no alternate views and there was no 
relativistic situational kinds of,

393
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,320
of interpreter approach is nonsense.
Okay.

394
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,370
Um,
but the point was we needed to restore 

395
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,490
history to literary literary study.
OkAy.

396
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,270
And we needed to add psychology to it 
because it was,

397
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,200
was great animus against freud when I 
arrived in,

398
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:25,950
in graduate school.

399
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,950
In fact,
I actually went into the director of 

400
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,830
graduate studies and protesting the way 
freud and freudian were used as,

401
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:35,790
as negative terms pay in a sneering way 
by that very wasp professors.

402
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,110
So we need to do.
And actually it seemed like we were 

403
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,491
moving there in the early 19 seventies 
was a great period of psycho biography 

404
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,180
about great.
About political figures.

405
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:50,181
Okay.
And So I thought it's happening in all 

406
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:50,760
of a sudden they'd all got short 
circuited by this arrival,

407
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:51,050
you know,
of,

408
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,470
of post poststructuralism and 
postmodernism in the,

409
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,900
in the,
in the 19 seventies.

410
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,860
Right.
Um,

411
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,990
so I,
I,

412
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,100
I feel I'm an old historic assist.
okay.

413
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
Now not a new historical.
So I mean I think new stores,

414
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,010
so it was an absolute scam and it's 
like,

415
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,430
it's just a way.
It's like tweezers you'd like just,

416
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,730
you pick a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

417
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:13,731
a little bit of that you make a little 
tiny salad and some of this atomized 

418
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:13,731
thing,
right?

419
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,070
It's supposed to mean something.
It's all can be very superficial,

420
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,170
very cynical,
very distance.

421
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,530
I like,
I am a,

422
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,080
I am the product.
Okay,

423
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:27,081
of old historicism german philology.
I decide my first choice of a profession

424
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,060
when I was a child.
What was egyptology archeology,

425
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,080
because I'm on.
Everything I ever think about or say is 

426
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,160
is related to an enormous time scheme.
Okay.

427
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,730
From from antiquity and indeed from the 
stone age,

428
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,070
and that is the problem with these 
people.

429
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:45,290
They're their male educated,
the postmodernist and academic marxists.

430
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,820
Okay.
Are male educated embarrassingly so.

431
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,800
Okay.
they know nothing before the present for

432
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,840
call.
Okay.

433
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
It's absolutely a joke before the 
enlightenment.

434
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:56,570
Okay.
Immune.

435
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,830
Perhaps he might be useful to people to 
talk about what happened at after 

436
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,230
neoclassicism,
whIch by the way,

437
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:05,650
he failed to notice a lot of what he was
talking about.

438
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Okay.
Turns out to cb simply the hangover of 

439
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:10,660
neoclassicism.
Okay.

440
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,500
This,
this is how ignorant that man was.

441
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,990
I mean his head was.
He was not talented as a researcher.

442
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,650
He knew absolutely nothing.
Okay,

443
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,290
well,
you know nothing about antiquity.

444
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,640
How can you make any kind of large 
structure,

445
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,840
but I'm large mechanism to analyze 
western culture without knowing about 

446
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,740
classical antiquity.
Okay.

447
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,741
He did not see anything.
He gets some person who had no business 

448
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:31,860
making large theoretical statements 
about anything.

449
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,400
Well,
maybe,

450
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,430
maybe part of it is that if you,
if you generate an intelligible doctrine

451
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,010
of radical relativism,
then there is no reason to assume that 

452
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,541
there are distinctions between 
categories of knowledge or between 

453
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:47,541
different levels of quality of 
knowledge.

454
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:52,101
Right.
so I've seen the same thing in the 

455
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,190
psychology departments,
although we have the,

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,630
uh,
what would you call it?

457
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:59,631
The luxury of being bounded at least to 
some degree by the empirical method and 

458
00:21:59,631 --> 00:21:59,631
by biology,
right?

459
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:03,030
It's one of the things that keeps most 
of the branches of psychology relatively

460
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,200
sane,
you know,

461
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,380
because the real world is actually built
into it to some degree.

462
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,120
But If you accept the postmodernist 
claim of radical relativism,

463
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:17,121
then you completely demolished the idea 
that there are quality levels that are 

464
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:18,660
associated with education because 
everything becomes the same.

465
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,560
And that seems to me to be a perfectly 
reasonable justification for maintaining

466
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:23,160
ignorance.

467
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,370
You know,
like through co.

468
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,000
I actually found him the most readable 
of the lacan.

469
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,540
There are de fuko triad.
You can read fuko.

470
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,780
I read mad distance civilization and a 
couple of his other books and I thought 

471
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,810
they were painfully obvious.
You know,

472
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:41,811
the idea that mental disorder is in part
a social construct is self evident to 

473
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,610
anybody who has even a smattering of 
psychiatric training.

474
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,850
I mean the real narrow medical types 
tend to to think of a mental disorder,

475
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,700
let's say as something that might be 
purely biological.

476
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:58,701
They have a peer disease model,
but nobody's who's a sophIsticated 

477
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:01,911
thinker ever thinks that it's a bit 
partly because medicine is a brand of 

478
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:06,051
engineering,
not a brand of science because it's 

479
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,181
associated with health and the 
diagnostic categories are hYbrids 

480
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:10,470
between physiological observation and 
sociocultural condition.

481
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,070
Everyone knows that and so when I reaD 
madness and civilization,

482
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:14,820
I thought,
well,

483
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,550
that's not radical.
That's just bloody self evident.

484
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,550
I actually think that he began,
you know,

485
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:27,530
the entire turn toward a theological 
grounding of modern psychology,

486
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,570
social psychology well launcher,
the 19 twenties for example.

487
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,750
You know,
the levels of ignorance of these.

488
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,520
These people moving foco with all 
original have not read durkheim.

489
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,190
They've not read mocks of or they've not
read erving goffman.

490
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:40,850
Okay,
so in other words,

491
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,420
to me,
for everything is the costing of the 

492
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,911
estimate because I had read the from 
which he was borrowing without 

493
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:48,911
attribution.
so I mean,

494
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,150
again,
I know these people I've met,

495
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,160
um,
in some cases knew them in graduate 

496
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,160
school,
people who went onto become these,

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,130
these,
these admirers of lack on dairy and I 

498
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,061
know what their training was there.
Training was purely within the english 

499
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:04,061
department.
That's all they ever knew.

500
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:05,600
they never made it any research outside 
of that.

501
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,260
Right.
Is the idea for coal is simply this is a

502
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:14,261
mechanism.
It's like a little tiny kit by which 

503
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:14,940
they can approach everything in culture 
and then,

504
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,970
and then the see,
but the contortions of language that 

505
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,111
deliberate labyrinthine elitists 
language at the same time as pretending 

506
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:22,660
to be a leftist.
Okay.

507
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,130
This is one of the biggest frauds.
every practice.

508
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:30,150
so I got a story to tell you that you 
might like because I've thought a lot 

509
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,160
about that use of language,
you know,

510
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:33,010
because language can be used as 
camouflage.

511
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:36,580
And so here's the story.
I think I got this from robert sapolsky.

512
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So he was talking about zebras and 
zebras of course have stripes and 

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,140
hypothetically that's associated with 
camouflage,

514
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,280
but it's not a straightforward 
association because zebras are black and

515
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:50,620
white and they're on the velt along with
the lions,

516
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,500
the lions are camouflaged cause their 
grass colored.

517
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:55,210
But the bloody zebras are black and 
white.

518
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,330
You can see them like 15 miles away.
So okay.

519
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:03,331
So biologists go out to study zebras and
they're like making notes on a zebra and

520
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:08,641
they watch it.
Then they look down at their notes and 

521
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:08,641
then they look up and they think,
oh no,

522
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:08,641
no,
no.

523
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,730
Which cbre I was looking at.

524
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,300
So the camouflage is actually against 
the herd because the zebras,

525
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:14,950
a hurt animal,
not an individual.

526
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:19,951
And so the black and white stripes break
up the animal against the herd so you 

527
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,791
can't identify it.
so this was a quandary for the 

528
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:23,791
biologists.
So they did one of two things.

529
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,260
One was drive a jeep up to the,
to the zebra,

530
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:29,560
heard and use a dab of red paint and dab
the horn.

531
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:33,190
Should the zebra or tag it with an ear 
tag like used for cattle.

532
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:39,030
The lions would kill it,
so as soon as it became identifiable the

533
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,390
pro,
yes,

534
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,000
the predators could organize their hunt 
around that.

535
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,310
Identify about animal.
That's why you know,

536
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,640
there's the old idea that lions and 
predators take down the weak animals,

537
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:51,490
but they don't.
They take down the identifiable animals.

538
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,580
So that's the thing is if you stick your
damn hand handout,

539
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,080
you get picked off by predators and so 
one of the things that academics seem to

540
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:03,010
do is congregate together in heard like 
entities and then they share a language,

541
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:08,011
right,
and the language unites them and also 

542
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:11,340
keeps them as long as they share the 
same set of linguistic tools among 

543
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,420
themselves that they know that there 
isn't anybody in the,

544
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,250
in the codery that's going to attack 
them or destabilize the entire herd.

545
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,030
And that seems to me to account for that
Impenetrable use of language.

546
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:22,980
it's,
it's,

547
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,990
it's group protection strategy and it 
has absolutely nothing to do with the 

548
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,950
search for.
It's the search for security within a 

549
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,470
system and not the desire to expand the 
system.

550
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:32,600
Right.
Not

551
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,620
federal,
but intimate is blatantly careerist 

552
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:37,620
because they made.
It was,

553
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,610
it was about advancement and with also 
about the claim that somehow they have 

554
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,900
special expertise.
This is a special technical language.

555
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,860
No one else can understand it.
Only only weekend,

556
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,030
but what's absurd about it absolutely 
ludicrous that these people,

557
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:53,031
these,
these american academics are imitating 

558
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:55,890
the contorted language of french at the 
translations from the french.

559
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,790
Okay.
When that call is translated into,

560
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,060
into english,
right?

561
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,910
There's a contortion there.
okay.

562
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,050
Well,
here's what he was trying to do in 

563
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,050
french was to break up.
Okay.

564
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,300
The neoclassical formulations that 
descended from racine,

565
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:14,301
there was something that was going on.
There was a sabotage of the french 

566
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:14,301
language going on that was necessary in 
France.

567
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,210
Not necessarily in english.
We have this long tradition of poetry.

568
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:20,130
Going back to the shakespeare and 
chaucer.

569
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,350
We have,
we have our own language,

570
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,600
but far more vItal than that than the 
french.

571
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,180
The french constrain their language all 
the time.

572
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,430
The absurdity in the amateur is okay of 
american academics trying to imitate.

573
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:38,600
Okay.
A translation of like hall,

574
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:43,650
okay,
we doing something in France that is 

575
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,550
absolutely not necessary and indeed 
wrong to be doing in english,

576
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,880
but the other,
the other cynical abandonment.

577
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,440
Okay.
Have the great tradition of,

578
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,000
of,
of,

579
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,630
of uh,
of the english departments.

580
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,870
And I,
I felt that the true radicalism was not 

581
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,360
about adding on other departments.
Okay.

582
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,610
So we have african american studies and 
you know,

583
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,110
and,
and,

584
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:05,111
and women's studies and so on.
The true radicalism would have been to 

585
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:06,390
shatter the departmental structure.
That's what I wanted.

586
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,600
I feel that was the authentic 
revolutionary 19,

587
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,960
67 to do,
right.

588
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,970
Don't look to them to blend all the 
literature,

589
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,710
literature,
study saudis together.

590
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:18,711
Okay.
Just to make easIer to make an 

591
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:18,870
interdisciplinary kind of organization 
or you know,

592
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,740
closer to the british model where a 
person can pursue related subjects,

593
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:23,880
overlapping subjects.

594
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,120
These,
these,

595
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,880
these departmental models.
Okay.

596
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:27,710
Are,
were,

597
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,700
were to me,
totalitarian to begin with.

598
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,180
Okay.
separating language into fiefdoms and,

599
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,810
and,
and what,

600
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,510
what the stitch to create a english 
women's studies department.

601
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,340
Absolutely.
Out of the air.

602
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,380
Just snap your fingers and create 
women's studies.

603
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,020
The english department had taken a 
century to develop.

604
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:43,510
Okay.
And was.

605
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,970
It was a huge argument.
Okay.

606
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:45,950
Within.
Within it.

607
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,060
Right.
And all of a sudden to create.

608
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:53,061
Okay.
It department where they politicize 

609
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:53,061
agenda from the start.
Okay.

610
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:54,330
By people without any training 
whatsoever in that field.

611
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:59,331
And what should be the.
What should be the parameters of the 

612
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:01,191
fIeld,
which would be the requirements of that 

613
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:01,191
feel.
How about biology?

614
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:01,191
Okay.
If you're going to be discussing gender,

615
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:03,090
that should have been a number one 
requirement.

616
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:08,091
Okay.
as part of any witness studies 

617
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:08,091
department or program.
But no,

618
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:08,250
it was all hands off.

619
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,360
it was just the administrators wanted to
solve a public relations problem.

620
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,780
They had a situation with very few women
faculty nationwide at a time when the 

621
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,221
women's movement had,
had just started up that spotlight of 

622
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:22,221
attention was,
was on them.

623
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:23,280
They want,
they needed women faculty fast.

624
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:26,060
They need to do with the women's subject
on the agenda fast.

625
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:31,061
Right.
So they just start let there be women's 

626
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:31,061
studies.
Okay.

627
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,340
And now we'll just hire some women.
It usually from english departments,

628
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,760
you know,
here and there and we'll just throw them

629
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,380
together.
You invent it,

630
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,410
you say what it is,
so that's why women's that has got 

631
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,560
frozen at certain point of the ideology 
of the early 19 seventies.

632
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,710
I was already in revolt from it.
Okay.

633
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:51,711
I went,
I was a precursor in terms of my 

634
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:52,560
endorsement of feminists some before it,
before even now is created.

635
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,830
Right.
But I couldn't.

636
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,620
I couldn't even have a conversation with
any of these women.

637
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:59,080
They were hysterical about this subject 
of biology.

638
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,470
they knew nothing about hormones and I.
I mean I,

639
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:03,460
I,
I probably got in fist fights over this.

640
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:08,461
They went.
People were so convinced that biology 

641
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:08,461
had nothing whatsoever to do with gender
differences.

642
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:13,810
That also seems to me to be related to 
the postmodern emphasis on power because

643
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,020
there's a,
there's something terrible underground 

644
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,241
going on there that is an.
I think this is the sort of thing that 

645
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:21,460
was reflected in the soviet union to,
in the,

646
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,490
especially in the twenties when there 
was this idea of radical idea that you 

647
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:26,830
could remake human beings entirely,
right?

648
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:31,690
Because they have no essential nature,
and so if your fundamental hypothesis is

649
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,780
that nothing exists except power and you
believe that,

650
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,810
then that also gives you the right in 
some sense to exercise your power at the

651
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,480
creation of the kind of humanity that 
your utopian vision envisioned.

652
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Then that has no fat and that also seems
to me to justify the postmodern 

653
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,990
insistence that everything is only a 
linguistic construct.

654
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:53,080
It again gOes down to the notion of 
power,

655
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:56,230
which dera done food co and luck tower,
so bloody obsessed with.

656
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,620
and so,
and it seems to me what they're trying 

657
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,620
to do is to,
uh,

658
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,380
to take all the potential power for the 
creation of human beings to themselves 

659
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,100
without any bounding conditions 
whatsoever.

660
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,450
RIght?
There's no history,

661
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,280
there's no biology,
there's,

662
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,550
and,
and everything is a fluid culture that 

663
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:14,550
can be manipulated at will.
and so I,

664
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,620
in Canada,
there are terrible arguments right now 

665
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:19,620
about biological essentialism,
let's say.

666
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,240
And one of the things that happened,
which was something I objected to 

667
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,211
precisely a year ago,
is that the social constructionist view 

668
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:28,780
of human identity.
He has been built now into canadian law.

669
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,130
So there's an insistence that biological
sex,

670
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,460
gender identity,
gender expression and sexual proclivity 

671
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,320
very independently with no causal 
relationship between any of the levels.

672
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,960
And so that's In the law and not only is
it in the law,

673
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,540
it's being taught everywhere,
it's being taught in the armed forces,

674
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,541
it's being taught in the police,
it's being taught to the elementary 

675
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,690
school kids and the junior high school 
kids and underneath it all,

676
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:57,691
I see this terrible striving for 
arbitrary power that's associated with 

677
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:59,420
this crazy utopianism and,
and,

678
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,960
and,
but I still don't exactly understand it.

679
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,670
I don't like,
I don't understand that.

680
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,630
What seems to be the hatred that 
motivates it that you see bubbling up,

681
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,640
for example,
in identity politics and,

682
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,740
and in the desire to do nothing but 
let's say demolish the patriarchy.

683
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,790
It kinda reminds me,
and this is something else I wanted to 

684
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:18,790
talk to you about,
you know,

685
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,651
in your,
you're an admirer of Eric Norman and 

686
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:22,651
have girl young.
Yeah.

687
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,221
And that's the human connection is 
really interesting because I think he's 

688
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:29,101
a bloody genius.
I really liked the great mother is a 

689
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:29,140
great book and it really a great 
warning.

690
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:34,141
That book and also the orIgins and 
history of consciousness is one of the 

691
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:34,480
most influential book.
Yeah.

692
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680
Yeah,
but that's so interesting.

693
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,040
I read an essay that you wrote or I 
don't remember

694
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,980
again at

695
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,270
the nyu.
Yes,

696
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,380
yes.
It's always been staggering to me that 

697
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,380
that book hasn't had the impact that it 
should have had.

698
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,700
I mean young himself in the preface to 
that book wrote that that was the book 

699
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:50,800
that he wished that he would have 
written.

700
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,980
It's very much associated with young 
symbols of transformation and it was a 

701
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,100
major influence on my book maps of 
meaning,

702
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:02,101
which was an attempt to outline the 
universal archetypes that are portrayed 

703
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,550
in the kind of religious structures that
you,

704
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,850
that you put forward,
but the thing that I really see 

705
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:08,850
happening,
and you can tell me what you think about

706
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,291
this and in norman's book consciousness,
which is masculine symbolically 

707
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:18,271
masculine for a variety of reasons is,
is viewed as rising up against the 

708
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:22,900
countervailing force of tragedy from an 
underlying feminine,

709
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,090
symbolically feminine unconsciousness.
Right.

710
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:30,091
and it's something that can always be 
pulled back into that unconsciousness 

711
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,420
that would be the microcosm of that 
would be the friday and eatable mother 

712
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,750
femineity dynamic where the mother was 
so over protective and all encompassing 

713
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:40,510
that she interferes with the development
of the competence,

714
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,610
not only of her sons,
but also of her daughters,

715
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:43,750
of her children in general.

716
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,260
And it seems to me that that's the 
dynamic that's being played out in our 

717
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,250
society right now is that there's this 
and it's,

718
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,720
it's related in some way that I don't 
understand to this,

719
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,900
to this insistence that all forms of 
masculine authority or nothing by 

720
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,680
tyrannical power.
So The symbolic representation is 

721
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,300
tyrannical father with no appreciation 
for the benevolent father and benevolent

722
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:10,030
mother with no appreciation whatsoever 
for the tyrannical mother.

723
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,140
Right?
And that's that.

724
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,620
And because I thought of videology as 
fragmentary mythologies,

725
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,740
that's where they get their archetype 
will in psychological power,

726
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,080
right?
And so on and balanced representation.

727
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:23,130
You have the terrible mother and the 
great mother as,

728
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,160
as norman laid out so nicely and you 
have the terrible father and the great 

729
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,030
father.
So that's the fact that culture mangles 

730
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,410
you have to death well,
it's also promoting you and developing 

731
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,351
you.
You have to see that as balanced and 

732
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:37,351
then you have the heroic and adversarial
individual.

733
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:42,240
But in the postmodern world,
and this seems to be something that's 

734
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,390
increasingly seeping out into the 
culture at large,

735
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,610
you have nothing but the tyrannical 
father,

736
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,820
nothing but the destructive force of 
masculine consciousness and nothing but 

737
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,620
the benevolent,
benevolent great mother and it's an,

738
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,650
it's an appalling ideology and it seems 
to me that it's sucking the vitality 

739
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,260
once,
which is exactly what you would expect 

740
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,131
symbolically.
It's sucking the vitality of our 

741
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,291
culture.
You see that with the increasing 

742
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:07,690
demolition of,
of young men,

743
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,390
um,
and not only young men in terms of their

744
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:13,150
academic performance,
which like they're falling way behind in

745
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,600
elementary school way behind in junior 
high and bailing out of the universities

746
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,400
like mad.
And so,

747
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,200
and I,
I,

748
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,990
well the public school education,
it's become completely permeated by this

749
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:25,290
kind of anti male propaganda.
I mean,

750
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,930
and to me,
public schools,

751
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:28,300
I just a form of imprisonment,
you know,

752
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:33,301
right now they are particularly 
destructive to young men who have a lot 

753
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:33,301
of physical energy,
right?

754
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:37,830
Uh,
yet now I identify as transgender gay 

755
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:37,830
mike myself,
but I do not,

756
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,880
I do not require the entire world to 
alter itself okay.

757
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,100
To,
to fit my particular in the self image.

758
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,240
I do believe in the power of hormones.
I believe that men exist and women 

759
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:54,531
exists and are biologically different.
I think that I think there is no cure 

760
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:59,541
for the cultural ills right now except 
if men start standing up and demanding 

761
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,030
that they be respected as men again.

762
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,100
Okay.
So I goT a question about that.

763
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,280
So,
so one of the things we did a research 

764
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,770
project year ago,
trying to figure out if there was such a

765
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:15,771
thing as political correctness from a 
psychometric perspective to find out is 

766
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:18,480
there the loose aggregation of beliefs 
actually clumped together statistically.

767
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,790
And we actually fOund two factors which 
I won't go into,

768
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,150
but then we looked at things that 
predicted adherence to that,

769
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,220
that a politically correct creed.
And there were a cOuple that were 

770
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,110
surprising.
One was being female was a predictor,

771
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,950
the personality attributes associated 
with femininity,

772
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,650
so that would be agreeableness and 
higher levels of negative emotion.

773
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:42,651
We're also both independent predictors 
but so were symptoms of personality 

774
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:46,521
disorder,
which I thought was really important 

775
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,831
because part of what I see happening is 
that like I think that women whose 

776
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,630
relationship with men have,
has been seriously pathologized,

777
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,660
cannot distinguish between male 
authority and competence and male 

778
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,591
tyrannical power,
like they failed to differentiate 

779
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:00,591
because all they see is the oppressive 
mail.

780
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,760
And then they may have had experiences 
that,

781
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,350
that,
um,

782
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,710
their experiences with men might've been
rough enough so that,

783
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:12,711
that differentiation never occurred 
because it has to occur and you have to 

784
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:15,210
have a lot of experience with men and 
good men do before that will occur.

785
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,630
BuT it seems to me that we're also 
increasingly dominated by a view of 

786
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,951
masculinity that's mostly characteristic
of women who have terrible personality 

787
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,180
disorders and who are unable to have 
healthy relationships with men.

788
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,950
Now.
But here's the problem,

789
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,190
you know,
this is something my wife has pointed 

790
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,190
out to.
She said,

791
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,491
well,
men are going to have to stand up for 

792
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:37,491
themselves,
but here's the problem.

793
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:39,430
I know how to stand up to a man who's,
who's,

794
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,660
uh,
unfairly trespassed against me.

795
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:47,661
And the reason I know that is because 
the parameters for my resistance are 

796
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,200
quite well defined,
which is we talk,

797
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,150
we argue,
we push,

798
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,460
and then it becomes physical,
right?

799
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,460
Like if,
if we move beyond the boundaries of 

800
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,620
civil discourse,
we know what the next step is.

801
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,430
Okay.
THat's forbidden in,

802
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,060
in discourse with women.
Right?

803
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,520
And so I don't think that men can 
control crazy women.

804
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,260
I don't think.
I really don't believe that.

805
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,690
I think that they have to throw their 
hands up in,

806
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,650
in,
in,

807
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,090
in what,
in,

808
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,960
in not even disbelief.
It's that the cultural,

809
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,990
there's no step forward that you can 
take under those circumstances because 

810
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,080
if the man is offensive enough and crazy
enough,

811
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,840
the reaction becomes physical right 
away.

812
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:29,841
Or at least the threat is there.
And when men are talking to each other 

813
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,370
in any serious manner,
that underlying thread of physicality is

814
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:35,010
always there,
especially if it's a real conversation,

815
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,270
keeps the things civil arts to some 
degree,

816
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:42,610
you know,
if you're talking to a man who wouldn't 

817
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,090
fight with you under any circumstances 
whatsoever,

818
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,450
then you're talking to someone to whom 
you have absolutely no respect,

819
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,100
but I can't see any way.

820
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,330
For example,
there's a,

821
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:54,331
there's a woman in in toronto who's been
organizing this movement,

822
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,340
let's say against me and some other 
people who are going to do a free speech

823
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,090
event and she managed to organize quite 
effectively and she's quite ofensive you

824
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,650
might say.
She compared us to nazis,

825
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:06,550
for example,
which,

826
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,950
you know,
publicly using the swastika,

827
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:11,200
which wasn't really something I was all 
that fond of.

828
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,470
But I,
I'm defenseless against that kind of 

829
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,411
female insanity because the techniques 
that I would use against a man who was 

830
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:22,000
employing those tactics are forbidden to
me.

831
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,360
So I don't know.
Like it seems to me that it isn't men 

832
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,730
that have to stand up and say enough of 
this,

833
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:32,731
even though that is what they should do.
It seems to me that it's same women who 

834
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:34,600
have to stand up against their crazy 
sisters and say,

835
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:39,601
look,
enough of that enough man hating enough 

836
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,900
pathology,
enough bringing disgrace on us as a,

837
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,990
as a gender,
but the problem there and then they'll 

838
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,660
stop my little tirade is that most of 
the women I know who are saying are busy

839
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,640
doing saying things right.
They're all,

840
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,410
they have their career,
they have their family,

841
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:58,411
they're quite occupied and they don't 
seem to have the time or maybe even the 

842
00:39:58,411 --> 00:40:01,240
interest to go after their,
their crazy harpy sisters and so I don't

843
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:05,470
see any regulating force for that,
that terrible femininity and it seems to

844
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:10,471
me to be invading the culture and 
undermining the masculine power of the 

845
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,170
culture in a way that's,
I think fatal.

846
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:14,990
I really do believe

847
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,040
I too.
I too believe that these are symptomatic

848
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,300
of the decline of western culture and,
and,

849
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,710
and it will just go down flat.
I don't think people realize that,

850
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,960
you know,
masculinity is still exists.

851
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:29,560
okay.
In the world as a code among jihadist.

852
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,250
Okay.
And,

853
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,500
and when you have Passionate 
masculinity,

854
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,620
right?
Circling the borders like the hawaiians 

855
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:37,620
and the vandals during the roman empire,
that that's what I see.

856
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,180
I see this culture rotting from within.
Okay.

857
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:42,720
And and does all link itself literally 
now my,

858
00:40:42,721 --> 00:40:47,721
I have an overview of why we're having 
these problems and if it comes from the 

859
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:48,910
fact that I'm the product of an 
immigrant family.

860
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:52,810
All four of my grandparents and my 
mother were born in Italy,

861
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,960
so I remember from my earliest years in 
this factory town in upstate New York 

862
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,381
where the y,
but my relatives came to work in the 

863
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:01,381
shoe factory.

864
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:01,630
I can remember still okay.
They,

865
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,980
the life of the agrarian era.
Okay.

866
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,590
Which,
which,

867
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,630
which for most of human history or the 
agrarian era where there was the world 

868
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,640
of men and the world of women and they 
sex has had very little to do with each 

869
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,741
other.
Each had power and status and its own 

870
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:19,741
realm.
Right?

871
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:20,730
And they.
And they laughed at each other in.

872
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:23,770
In essence,
the way the women had enormous power.

873
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:28,771
In Fact,
the old women ruled not the young 

874
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:28,771
beautiful woman like today,
but the,

875
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:33,170
the older you were,
the more you had control over our 

876
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,250
everyone,
including the mating and marriage.

877
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,240
Um,
you know,

878
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,730
there were no doctors so that you had 
the,

879
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,920
the old women were like midwives and 
knew all the ins and outs of this and 

880
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,130
inherited knowledge about pregnancy and 
all these other things.

881
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,780
Right?
I can remember this.

882
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,150
And,
and the joy that women had with each 

883
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,150
other all day long.
Okay.

884
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,300
Cooking with each other,
you know,

885
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,930
a companions to each other.
Talking,

886
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,900
conversing.
My mother remembered as a small child in

887
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,850
Italy when it was time to do the 
laundry,

888
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,680
they would take the laundry up the 
mountain,

889
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,590
up the hill to the fountain you'll ago.
Okay.

890
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:04,490
And,
and do it by hand.

891
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,530
They would sing,
they would pick nick and so on.

892
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,550
Right?
And we get a glimpse of that in the 

893
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:11,550
odyssey when odysseus is,
is,

894
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,530
is thrown up naked on the shores of asia
and,

895
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,750
and he hears the sound of women,
young women laughing and singing.

896
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,840
And it's nausicaa the princess bringing 
the women to do the laundry where he's 

897
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:22,840
exactly the same thing.
Right?

898
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,080
so there was a,
each,

899
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,250
each gender had its own hierarchy,
its own values,

900
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:31,370
own way of talking.
And the sexist rarely intersected.

901
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,340
Like I can remember in my childhood on a
holiday.

902
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,020
TypiCal,
it could be christmas,

903
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,700
it could be a thanksgiving,
whatever.

904
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,430
All the women would be cooking all day 
long.

905
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,140
Everyone would sit down to eat.
Okay.

906
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,930
And then after that,
okay.

907
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,720
The women who retire unmasked to the 
kitchen and the men would go,

908
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,740
I would,
I would look at the window and see all 

909
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:52,740
the men.
The men would be all outside,

910
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,560
usually gather around the car.
Okay.

911
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:57,800
Then a time when cars didn't work as 
well as they do today with the hood up.

912
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,630
Okay.
And the men would be standing with their

913
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:02,840
hands on their hips like that.
Everyone's staring at the engine.

914
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,850
And I went,
yeah.

915
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:05,150
That's how I learned.
Okay.

916
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,210
Men where we refreshing themselves by 
studying something technical and 

917
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:10,690
mechanical after being with women.
Okay.

918
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:11,930
You know,
for during the dinner.

919
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:12,370
Okay.
And so,

920
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:17,530
so,
so all of these problems of today are 

921
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,021
the direCt consequence of women's 
emancipation and freedom from housework,

922
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,830
thanks to capitalism,
okay?

923
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,520
Which made it possible for women to have
jobs outside the home for the very first

924
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:30,521
time in the 19th century,
no longer to be dependent on a husband 

925
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:31,160
or father or brother,
right?

926
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,700
And so this great,
great thing that's happened to us,

927
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,800
allowing us to be totally self 
supporting independent agents has 

928
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:44,831
produced all this animosity about making
too many men and women because the 

929
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,800
women,
women feel unhappy.

930
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,780
Women Today,
wherever I go,

931
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,520
whether it's Italy or Brazil or england 
or America or toronto,

932
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,280
okay?
The,

933
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:53,770
the,
the,

934
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,660
the upper middle class professional 
women are unhappy,

935
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:58,530
miserable they want and they don't know 
what,

936
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,250
why they're unhappy.
They want to blame it on men.

937
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,640
The men must change.
Men must become more like women know 

938
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,090
that is the wrong way to go.
Okay?

939
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:13,091
It's when men are men and understand 
themselves as men are secure as men,

940
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,540
then you are going to be happier.

941
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,620
Well,
there's nothing more dangerous than a 

942
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:19,620
weak man.
Absolutely.

943
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,300
Okay.
And especially all these quislings okay.

944
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,450
Spouting feminist rhetoric,
I hear that.

945
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,780
Okay.
I mean it makes me sick,

946
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,810
but here's the point.
Men and women have never worked side by 

947
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,960
side ever.
Maybe under farms.

948
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:34,961
okay.
When you were like maybe one person in 

949
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:34,961
the potato fields,
the other ones over here in the.

950
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:35,300
During the tOmatoes or whatever.
Okay.

951
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:35,640
You,
you,

952
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:36,180
you,
you had,

953
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,550
you had familieS working,
working side by side,

954
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,120
exhaust with each other.
no time to have it in any of this.

955
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:44,670
It was a collaborative effort on,
on forums and so on.

956
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,910
Never in all of human history have men 
and women been working side by side and 

957
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,860
women are now the pressure about silicon
valley.

958
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,640
There are also sexist.
They don't allow women in and so on.

959
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,620
The men are being men in silicOn valley 
and the women,

960
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,850
the engineers and the women are 
demanding that,

961
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,210
oh,
this is terrible.

962
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,450
You're being say maybe the sexes.
Okay.

963
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,890
HAve their own particular form of 
rhetoric.

964
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:10,410
Their own particular form of identity.
Okay.

965
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,370
Maybe.
Okay.

966
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:12,230
We need to re,
re,

967
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:13,500
re,
re examine.

968
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:14,700
Okay.
This business about your,

969
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:19,701
the mic.
Maybe we have to perhaps except some 

970
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:20,610
degree of tension and conflict between 
the sexes.

971
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:22,290
Okay.
In a work environment,

972
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't mean harassment.
I'm sorry.

973
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm talking about women feeling 
disrespected now.

974
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,130
Somehow they their opinions when they 
express them.

975
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,620
Okay.
Are not taken seriously or or the.

976
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,750
Or even hillary clinton is complaining.
Oh,

977
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:37,570
when a woman writes something online,
she's attacked immediately so.

978
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,090
Well,
everyone's attacked online.

979
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,920
What are you talking about?
The world is tough.

980
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,330
The world is competitive.
Okay.

981
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:44,130
Identity is hold.
Okay.

982
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:49,131
By conflict,
the idea that there should be no 

983
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:51,081
conflict,
that we have to be in this bath at 

984
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,081
probation and you know,
we just,

985
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,370
we just devour it.
That's

986
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:58,370
right.
It's absolutely infant title in a 

987
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:58,370
minute.
Okay,

988
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:58,370
so a couple of things there.
Well,

989
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:58,580
the first thing is,
is that the,

990
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,630
the agreeableness trait that divides men
and women most.

991
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,660
There's three things that divide women 
and men most particularly from the 

992
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,990
psychometric perspective.
One is that women are more agreeable 

993
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,521
than men,
and so that seems to be the primary 

994
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:13,521
maternal dimension as far as I can tell 
them.

995
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,350
It's associated with a desire to avoid 
conflict,

996
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:18,960
but it's associated with interpersonal 
closeness,

997
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:20,250
compassion,
politeness.

998
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,240
Women are reliably higher than men,
especially in the scandinavian countries

999
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:29,241
and in the countries where 
egalitarianism has progressed the 

1000
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:29,241
farthest,
so that's where the difference is.

1001
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,550
Maximize,
which is one of the things james demore 

1002
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,040
poInted out quite correctly and his 
infamous google memo,

1003
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,170
okay,
women are hIgher in negative emotion,

1004
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:41,460
so that's anxiety and emotional pain,
not that difference is approximately the

1005
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:46,230
same size and again that maximizes in 
egalitarian societies which is extremely

1006
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:51,231
interesting and then the biggest 
difference is the difference in 

1007
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:54,381
interests between people and things and 
so women are more interested in people 

1008
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:58,251
and men are more interested in things 
which goes along quite nicely with your 

1009
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:01,281
car anecdote,
but the thing about men interacting with

1010
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:06,291
men again,
is that it isn't that they respect each 

1011
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:06,291
other's viewpoints.

1012
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,230
That's not exactly right.
What happens with a man,

1013
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:12,350
and I know a lot of men that I would 
regard as as remarkably tough people for

1014
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,830
one reason or another and everything you
do with them as a form of combat,

1015
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,440
like if you want your viewpoint taken 
seriously,

1016
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,590
often you have to yell them down and 
like they're not going to stop talking 

1017
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,200
unless you start talking over them.
You know,

1018
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:29,530
and it's not like manner automatically 
giving respect to other men because that

1019
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:30,760
just doesn't happen.
Instead,

1020
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:34,990
the combat is there and it's expected 
and one of the problems,

1021
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,050
and so this is part of the reason why I 
think men are being out of so much of 

1022
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,251
academia and and maybe the academic 
world in general and maybe the world in 

1023
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,780
general,
is that men actually don't have any idea

1024
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,410
how to compete with women.
Because the problem is,

1025
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:52,810
is that if you unleash yourself 
completely,

1026
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:54,010
then you're an absolute bully.

1027
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:59,010
And there's no doubt about that.
Because if men unleash themselves on 

1028
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,160
other men,
that can be pretty goddamn brutal.

1029
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,110
Especially for the men that are really 
tough.

1030
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,390
and so that just doesn't happen with 
women.

1031
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,170
But.
So you can't unleash yourself completely

1032
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,670
if you,
when you're a bully,

1033
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,860
if you lose while you're just bloody 
pathetic.

1034
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:14,440
So how the hell are you supposed to play
a game like that,

1035
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,560
you know?
So I've worked with lots of women in law

1036
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,430
firms in Canada for example,
and and high achieving women,

1037
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,560
like really remarkable people I would 
say.

1038
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,980
And they're often nonplussed I would say
by the attitude of the man in the law 

1039
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,721
firm because they would like to see 
everyone pulling together because 

1040
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:36,961
they're all part of the same team,
whereas the manner like at each other's 

1041
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:40,831
throats in an,
in a cooperative way because they want 

1042
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:44,311
the law firm to succeed,
but they want to be the person who's at 

1043
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:44,980
the top of the success hierarchy.
Right?

1044
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:45,990
So,
and that,

1045
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,470
that doesn't jive well with the more 
competitive or cooperative ethos.

1046
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:55,471
That's part and parcel of agreeableness.
And so we don't really have any idea how

1047
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:57,490
to integrate male and female dominance.

1048
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,990
Exactly.
That's exactly right.

1049
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,910
This is why I love this show.
Real housewives and I,

1050
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,860
which,
which is scorings.

1051
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:10,150
And jusT say,
just last night I was watching one 

1052
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,150
episode right where the women were at 
each other.

1053
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,170
Okay.
At a party and not in,

1054
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:12,320
in,
in recounting,

1055
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,120
but I said this to you,
but you said this to me and the men got.

1056
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,630
We got together there and said,
well,

1057
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:20,550
this is the way they communicate with 
each other and innocent and that,

1058
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,430
you know,
men,

1059
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,660
men,
okay,

1060
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,790
just we'll have a fistfight and wheel 
him in 10 minutes later we're going to 

1061
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,250
have a beer at the bar next to each 
other and so on.

1062
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,630
And I have observed that.
My mind,

1063
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:31,540
my daughter,

1064
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,140
my daughter used to be really irritated 
about that because she,

1065
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:40,141
she,
like most people was the target of 

1066
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:42,440
feminine,
a conspiratorial bullying at one.

1067
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,140
She's no pushover.
My daughter.

1068
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:47,500
so this wasn't like this was a continual
thing or that she didn't know what to do

1069
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:52,501
about it,
but she used to observe these girls 

1070
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:54,280
conspiring against her and then black 
getting your name on on facebook,

1071
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:59,281
which is part of it,
part and parcel of the typical female 

1072
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:00,520
bullying routine,
which is often reputation demolition,

1073
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:02,140
right?
That there's a good literature on that.

1074
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,440
And Then she'd watched what would happen
if my brother or my son would have a 

1075
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,040
dispute with his friends,
you know,

1076
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:14,041
and maybe they were drinking and there 
was a dispute they'd have a fight and 

1077
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:14,041
then the next day they were friends 
again.

1078
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,801
And that's another thing that's strange 
is that men have a way of bringing a 

1079
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:19,990
conflict to a head and resolving it 
right.

1080
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,200
And that it isn't obvious to me that 
Women have that same,

1081
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,680
perhaps you might call it a luxury,
but it's also the case that men know 

1082
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,351
what to do when they get into a conflict
with a woman because what the hell are 

1083
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:32,351
you supposed to do?
You know,

1084
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:33,980
mostly what you're supposed to do is 
avoid it.

1085
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,850
And

1086
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,020
well,
I think um,

1087
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,070
you know,
I don't know whether this crosses into 

1088
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,261
other countries,
but that there was a certain kind of 

1089
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:45,440
taunting and teasing that men and boys 
do with each other that toughens them.

1090
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:45,860
Okay.
And,

1091
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,630
and where they don't,
they don't take things seriously.

1092
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:51,260
But a girl feelings become extremely 
hurt if you hear something like that.

1093
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,540
It goes very tough,
you know,

1094
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,500
again,
like sarcastic against her.

1095
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,620
so I mean,
I do feel that there are profound 

1096
00:50:59,620 --> 00:50:59,870
differences between the sexes and in 
terms of emotions,

1097
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:05,020
in terms of communication patterns.
I know my father used to say that he 

1098
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,750
could never follow women's can 
conversations.

1099
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:09,720
He said he said women don't even finish 
the finish sentences that with the women

1100
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,930
understand immediately what the other 
woman is saying.

1101
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:12,710
Okay.
Uh,

1102
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,760
and um,
the way the women tend to be more 

1103
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,891
interested in or haven't been 
traditionally more interested in soap 

1104
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:23,471
operas,
it's not just the women who were home 

1105
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:24,920
without jobs is that I honestly,
I believe that soap opera does reflect,

1106
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:27,170
does mirror the way women talk to each 
other.

1107
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,330
There's these communication patterns and
then built up through women,

1108
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,550
the world of women.
Okay.

1109
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,520
Which was it made sense.
There was a division of labor.

1110
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:39,590
Okay.
It wasn't sexism against women that 

1111
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,101
there was a division of labor.
The men went off to hunt and did the 

1112
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:44,411
dangerous thing.
The women stayed around the heart 

1113
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:44,411
because you had pregnant women,
nursing women,

1114
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:44,750
older women.
Okay.

1115
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,760
They were cooking and so on.
So I feel that these communication 

1116
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,960
patterns that we're talking about have 
been built up over the centuries and the

1117
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,810
men had to toughen each other.
Okay.

1118
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,540
Do want to go out in the hunting part is
a native americans,

1119
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:01,541
you know,
it would be gone for two weeks and it 

1120
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:01,730
was when the temperature was below zero 
and many of didn't die.

1121
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,170
Okay.
Yeah.

1122
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,250
Yeah.
The idea that somehow in any kind of 

1123
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,031
separation of the sexes are different 
spheres of the sexes is inherently 

1124
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:12,490
sexist power dynamic.

1125
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,240
The answer to all of this.
Okay.

1126
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,130
Then everything that we're talking 
about.

1127
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:19,610
Okay.
Is education into early history.

1128
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:20,820
Okay.
And until you are,

1129
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:23,780
until people understand the stone age,
but nomadic period,

1130
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,140
the agrarian era and ended up and how 
culture,

1131
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:28,940
how civilization built up.
Okay.

1132
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,640
In mesopotamia,
the great irrigation projects,

1133
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,120
or in orange Egypt where you head for 
the first centralized government 

1134
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,960
authority became necessary.
Okay.

1135
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:42,860
To master these needs and you had a 
situation where an environmentally,

1136
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,820
uh,
you know,

1137
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,470
a difficult situation like the deserts 
of mesopotamia or,

1138
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,050
or the,
the peculiar character of,

1139
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:52,610
of Egypt and geography where you can 
only have a little tiny,

1140
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,510
tiny,
fertile line along the edges of denial.

1141
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,510
OkAy.
Otherwise,

1142
00:52:56,511 --> 00:53:00,470
desert landscape.
So this civilization and authority.

1143
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,380
Okay.
Right.

1144
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,400
I as not necessarily about power 
grabbing,

1145
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:09,430
but about organization to achieve 
something for the good of the people as 

1146
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,160
a whole.

1147
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:16,530
Well,
that's exactly the symbolism of the 

1148
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:16,530
great for reducing

1149
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,980
hierarchy to,
to power and selfish power.

1150
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:22,050
Okay.
Is it is utterly naive.

1151
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,070
It's ignorant,
right?

1152
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,790
So I say education to be totally 
reconstituted,

1153
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,530
including public education to be getting
the most distant past it,

1154
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:35,531
so that.
So our young people today who know 

1155
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:37,551
nothing about how the,
how the world was created that they 

1156
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:37,551
inhabit,
okay.

1157
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:37,551
Can understand,
okay,

1158
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:40,890
what marvelous technological paradise 
they live in.

1159
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,950
And it's the product of capitalism as 
the productive of individual innovation 

1160
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,640
is the most of,
is the project will have a western 

1161
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,640
tradition that everyone wants to trash 
now is there,

1162
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,380
if you be getting the past and show it 
also talk about war because the war is 

1163
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,730
the one thing that wakes people up.
Okay.

1164
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,000
As we see wars,
wars,

1165
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:03,600
the reality principle,
my father and all five of my uncles went

1166
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:08,601
to world war two.
My father was part of the force that I 

1167
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:09,420
landed in Japan.
Okay.

1168
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,460
Uh,
as a paratrooper,

1169
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,480
um,
you know,

1170
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,840
at the time of the japanese surrender 
and,

1171
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,060
and a couple uncles got shot up and so 
on,

1172
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,180
when you have the reality of war,
when people see the reality of the 

1173
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,450
horrors of war,
berlin burned to a crisp and,

1174
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,440
and so on.
Starvation.

1175
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:29,040
Okay?
Then you understand,

1176
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:34,041
okay,
there's a marvelous mechanism that 

1177
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:34,041
brings water,
you know,

1178
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:34,041
to,
to the,

1179
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,270
to the kitchen.
And when you flip on a light looked 

1180
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,270
lately,
electric,

1181
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,270
electricity.

1182
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,270
No.
For me,

1183
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,340
like I suppose it's because I have 
somewhat of a depressive temperament.

1184
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:45,341
I mean,
one Thing that staggers me on a 

1185
00:54:45,341 --> 00:54:45,890
consistent basis is the fact that 
anything ever works.

1186
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,230
I mean because it's so unlikely you 
know,

1187
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:48,730
to,
to,

1188
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,160
to be in a situation where our 
electronic communications work,

1189
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:57,310
where our,
where our electric grid works and it 

1190
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:57,310
works all the time,
right?

1191
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,121
It works a hundred percent of the time 
and the reason for that is that there 

1192
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:04,391
are mostly men out there who are 
breaking themselves into pieces 

1193
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:06,230
repairing this thing which just falls 
apart all the time.

1194
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,740
I said this in the month debate,
okay?

1195
00:55:08,741 --> 00:55:12,670
In toronto several years ago,
I said that there's the invisible at all

1196
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:13,770
these,
these,

1197
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:16,000
you know,
these elitist professors,

1198
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:21,001
sneering at men.
It's men who are maintaining everything 

1199
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,300
around us and anything is an invisible 
army.

1200
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,660
Which feminist don't notice.
Nothing would work

1201
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,590
or regarded regarded as impressive,
which was,

1202
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,720
you know,
like a professor is someone who's 

1203
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,200
standing on a hill surrounded by a wall 
which is surrounded by another wall 

1204
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,680
which is surrounded by another wall.
Like it's walls all the way down.

1205
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,530
Who stands uP there and says,
I am brave and independent.

1206
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:44,190
It's like you've got this protected area
that's so unlikely.

1207
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:47,880
It's so absolutely unlikely,
and the fact that people aren't on their

1208
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:52,881
knees in gratitude all the time for the 
fact that we have central heating and 

1209
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,870
air conditioning and and pure water and 
reliable food,

1210
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:56,340
it's just,
it's so.

1211
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,570
It is.
It's absolutely unbelievable and

1212
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:02,880
people used to die for then the water 
supply was contaminated with cholera for

1213
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:03,640
heaven's sakes,
right?

1214
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,830
People don't understand,
okay.

1215
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:07,170
That kept clean water,
fresh milk,

1216
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:08,850
fresh orange juice,
all of these things,

1217
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:10,390
these mro,
nolan at the time,

1218
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:14,090
all the time,
if that western culture is heading,

1219
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:19,190
become because we are so dependent on 
this invisible infrastructure where a 

1220
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,830
heading for an absolute catastrophe when
hottest,

1221
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,310
figure out how to paralyze the power 
grid,

1222
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:29,460
the entire culture will be be chaotic.
You'll have mobs in the street.

1223
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,270
Okay,
and within three days.

1224
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:31,690
Okay,
wIndow.

1225
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,260
So suddenly the food supply is 
interrupted and there's no light.

1226
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,710
There's no,
no way to communicate.

1227
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,360
There'll be like a robert.
I mean that.

1228
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,910
That is the way western culture is going
to collapse.

1229
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:44,911
Okay?
And it won't take much because we are so

1230
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:47,240
interconnected and now we are so it's 
so.

1231
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:51,550
It's so dependent on communications and 
computers to the the I've,

1232
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,580
I've,
I used to predict for years there'll be 

1233
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:56,580
an asteroid hitting there enough another

1234
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,670
the solar flares work.
So back in.

1235
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,730
This happens about once every century,
so back about 18,

1236
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:04,680
80,
and I don't remember the exact year.

1237
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:07,050
There was a significant enough solar 
flare,

1238
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,270
so that produces a electromagnetic 
pulse,

1239
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:14,271
like a hydrogen bomb because the sun is 
a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic 

1240
00:57:14,271 --> 00:57:18,531
pulse will emerge from the sun and wave 
across the earth and it produces huge 

1241
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:22,671
spikes in electrical electrical curd 
along anything that's electronic and 

1242
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:27,081
it'll burn them out.
It led it lid telegraph operators on 

1243
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:29,310
fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those
things took out the quebec power grid in

1244
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:31,980
1985 and knocked out the whole northeast
corridor.

1245
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,400
And so they figure those things are 
about one in new century event.

1246
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,700
But those single.
I have my brother in law who's a very 

1247
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,190
smart guy.
He designed the chip and the iphone.

1248
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:46,191
We were talking about political issues 
the last time I went and saw him in san 

1249
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:49,791
francisco and his notion was that all 
that the government should be doing 

1250
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:53,571
right now is stress testing our 
infrastructure the same way they stress 

1251
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,560
test the banks because we're so full of 
these single points of failure that.

1252
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,840
And I think you're absolutely right.
Luckily we've been,

1253
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,580
um,
what would you call,

1254
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:04,910
invaded by stupid terrorists instead of 
smart terrorists because it's a smart 

1255
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,931
terrorists could do an unbelievable 
amount of damage in a very short period 

1256
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:12,441
of time.
So when it's just god's good graces 

1257
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:12,441
that,
that hasn't happened yet.

1258
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:12,441
And so,

1259
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,440
and then what will happen is that if the
men,

1260
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,480
okay,
the men will reconstruct civilization 

1261
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,531
while the women cower in the houses and 
they have the men go out and do all the 

1262
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,020
dirty work.
That's what's going to happen again.

1263
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:26,570
only men will,
will bring civilization back again.

1264
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,890
So what.
Okay.

1265
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,100
So now a couple of things.
So the,

1266
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,060
the universities,
I mean I've proposed,

1267
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:39,061
although it's something that's probably 
beyond my power that what should happen 

1268
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:43,081
is that the universities,
the real content of the universities 

1269
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,991
should be stolen back from the 
universities because they're not making 

1270
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:48,571
use of their intellectual property and 
that something should be started online 

1271
00:58:48,571 --> 00:58:49,000
that would constitute a genuine 
university.

1272
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:54,390
The problem is the accreditation issue,
but I don't think that's a solvable 

1273
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,370
problem.
But do you see like all these people who

1274
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:02,371
have these postmodern neil marxist 
agendas are completely embedded inside 

1275
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:02,371
the unit

1276
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,950
and the point is over the,
over the last 25 years,

1277
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:10,951
I have received constant mail from 
people dropping out of the graduate 

1278
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:14,851
school.
So I and r or giving up altogether on 

1279
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:15,700
any idea of being a college professor 
because what's happened is that the most

1280
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:19,060
talent than an independent thinking 
people have avoided in the school.

1281
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,980
So we are now who we have on the 
compliant.

1282
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,150
The survival.
Okay.

1283
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:25,460
The people who are currently in the 
university and,

1284
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,200
and hiring their successors.
Okay.

1285
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,930
Are male educated themselves.
I mean,

1286
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:34,950
I,
I went on the first letters I received 

1287
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,950
and the early 19 nineties,
I'll never forget it,

1288
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,270
it was from a woman who was now a 
painting houses in Missouri and said she

1289
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:41,530
had been part of the comparative 
literature or a graduate program at,

1290
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:41,840
uh,
at,

1291
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:46,950
you know,
at berkeley and that she finally had to 

1292
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,691
drop out because she said every time she
would express enthusiasm for what they 

1293
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,510
were reading,
the qa,

1294
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,340
the people looked at her as if she had 
somehow encouraging an offense in other,

1295
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:58,090
in other words,
enthusiasm for art or new,

1296
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,920
the very things you need as a teacher in
the classroom.

1297
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,430
Okay.
We're being trained out

1298
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,460
your undergrad.
If you respect art and literature,

1299
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:11,060
that means that you implicitly accept a 
hierarchy of quality.

1300
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:11,830
Right.
And not to,

1301
01:00:11,831 --> 01:00:15,170
of course contradicts the fundamental 
tenants of the postmodern doctrine,

1302
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:17,780
which is that there are no hierarchies 
of quality.

1303
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,740
And you know,
when you.

1304
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,640
You talked a little bit earlier about 
the,

1305
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,900
the idea that you referred again to the 
idea that everything is associated with 

1306
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,410
power and that's,
that's the thing that I can't.

1307
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,020
That's the thing that I can't help but 
associate with,

1308
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,180
with the kind of personality pathology,
like you know from a psychometric 

1309
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,491
perspective,
the best predictors of longterm success 

1310
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:39,590
in our society,
our intelligence iq,

1311
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,310
which you can measure very accurately 
and trait conscientiousness,

1312
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:45,620
which actually is a real testament to 
the culture,

1313
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:50,621
right?
Because what you hope is that the smart 

1314
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:50,621
people who work hard are the people who 
advance it.

1315
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:50,621
Not.

1316
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:52,460
It isn't like they deserve it.
Exactly.

1317
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:57,461
That isn't what I mean.
It's that if the culture is harnessing 

1318
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:58,460
the productive power of individuals 
properly,

1319
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:03,670
then it should differentially reward 
people who are smart and conscientious 

1320
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,851
because they're going to do a bunch of 
really interesting work for the rest of 

1321
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:06,851
us and that that's very well 
established.

1322
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:11,561
Finding it's,
it's as good as any finding in the 

1323
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:14,051
social sciences,
but despite that and despite the fact 

1324
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:16,160
that everything works,
which is a god damn miracle of sorts,

1325
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:20,780
there is this consistent story that we 
live in a patriarchy,

1326
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:25,781
that it's only oppressive,
that it's done nothing but oppressed 

1327
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:28,271
women since the beginning of time,
which is also something that just 

1328
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:28,271
boggles my mind.
You know,

1329
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:28,750
like I knew

1330
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,130
that I have sacrificed for our women and
children cleaner their lives.

1331
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,710
Okay.
For thousands of years,

1332
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,600
you know that and yes,
there's been brutality,

1333
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,400
but the battalion and the minority.
Okay.

1334
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,180
Yes.
This,

1335
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:44,181
this sick.
The portrayal of human history is 

1336
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:45,840
nothing but male oppression and female 
victim manage.

1337
01:01:45,841 --> 01:01:50,841
Okay.
This is a way to permanently ensure the 

1338
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:50,841
infantilization of women.

1339
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:50,950
Absolutely.
Yes.

1340
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,960
Well,
and you can even make the case from a 

1341
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:55,960
purely logical perspective.
So.

1342
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,030
So here's an interesting,
here's an interesting thought.

1343
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:03,450
So most of the people who abuse their 
children were abused as children,

1344
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:08,860
but most of the people who were abused 
as children don't abuse their children.

1345
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:14,250
Right?
So if you look at the population of 

1346
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:14,250
abusers,
they were all abused.

1347
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,100
So you can say abuse causes abuse,
but that's,

1348
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,220
that's not a good idea because you have 
a specific sample there,

1349
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:19,830
right?
It's not a sample.

1350
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,460
What happens is that abuse dampens out 
over the centuries.

1351
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:27,450
It doesn't propagate itself.
And that's obvious because if there was,

1352
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,970
if,
if the hypothesis of essential men,

1353
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
male tyranny was true,
it would spread exponentially through 

1354
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,031
the population.
And like three generations and there 

1355
01:02:38,031 --> 01:02:40,221
wouldn't be an exception at all.
And so what happens is even when there 

1356
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:43,791
is a tilt towards tyranny,
let's say in the family or even in the 

1357
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,170
society that regresses back to something
that's far more benign,

1358
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:47,290
very,
very rapidly.

1359
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,230
You see this so

1360
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:54,630
hit me when one of the biggest 
unexamined issues is the transition from

1361
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:58,140
the great extended family of old okay 
into the nuclear family.

1362
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,610
And I do feel that freud is the best 
analyst of the particular,

1363
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,290
particular kind of claustrophobic cell 
of,

1364
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,760
of the modern nuclear family.
It could be the human being,

1365
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,860
it could be that human beings were never
intended.

1366
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:12,330
Okay.
It should be to be trapped in a house,

1367
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,660
just what their parents and their 
extended families.

1368
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:19,080
But you had your aunts and you know,
in grandparents and cousins,

1369
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,750
all of whom helped form your identity.
Okay.

1370
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:22,260
So what,
what,

1371
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:27,330
what one's identity with one member of a
community rather than in just like hot 

1372
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,760
house environment.
So I think a lot of current issues,

1373
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,960
including the sudden spate of 
transgender claims and so on,

1374
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,450
that a lot of these things are coming 
from,

1375
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,290
um,
unstable of in cell.

1376
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,780
It's a truly a prison cell of a nuclear 
family.

1377
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:47,100
Two parents perhaps cannot give all the 
knowledge of life okay to,

1378
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,780
to the young.
And so I,

1379
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:50,490
I think there are all kinds of,
of um,

1380
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:51,850
sexual issues,
you know,

1381
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,960
in that are generated by.
But with the psychology today is a,

1382
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:01,740
is now I would simply a matter of a 
practical matter and people come in,

1383
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:02,510
uh,
you know,

1384
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:05,390
the psychologist in the United States 
deals with your,

1385
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:08,370
your present problem.
Let's not go into the distant past,

1386
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:13,371
okay,
let's just deal with our president 

1387
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:14,871
problem which are,
which obviously we have forms of 

1388
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:15,060
communication we need to like fix this 
and then you'll be fine.

1389
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,360
As a consequence,
there's a complete absence of any kind 

1390
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,980
of analysis of your experiences as a 
child with your parents,

1391
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,540
with,
with your siblings and so on.

1392
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,530
How that might relate to your current 
sexual identity issues,

1393
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,050
whether it's transgender,
whether it's homosexuality,

1394
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:31,710
it has impact.

1395
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:36,770
You cannot possibly ask you about any 
genesis of homosexuality today because 

1396
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,940
that is automatically defined as 
homophobic.

1397
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:39,930
Well,
excuse me,

1398
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,140
every single as an openly gay person 
myself,

1399
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,180
I every gay person I know.
Okay.

1400
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,450
There is some story.
There seems to be in childhood.

1401
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:53,630
Not only that,
there's a string similarity of the 

1402
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:53,940
storylines of all of my friends who are 
gay.

1403
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,420
There's the same pattern that had to do 
with blurred borderlines,

1404
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,270
be between a son and his mother and so 
on.

1405
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,800
I'm not blaming the mother.
Okay.

1406
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:03,230
I'm not blaming the mother at all.
Okay.

1407
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:08,260
What I.
What I see as a dynamic going on the 

1408
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,731
bourgeois house,
so the nuclear family where you had 

1409
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:11,160
sometimes a distant father.
Okay.

1410
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,830
A father who was present but it but not 
really engaged,

1411
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,270
and a mother who,
who,

1412
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:15,840
who,
who,

1413
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,820
who,
who made the.

1414
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,440
Her companion is some way off in the 
mother has great imagination and flare 

1415
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,360
and they had a shared thing and I mean 
the idea that sexuality has nothing,

1416
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:27,850
whatever to do.
Okay with your family.

1417
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:28,640
Life is not good.

1418
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,910
I grow.
It's also completely well.

1419
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,880
That's another thing,
and I got a lot of trouble in Canada for

1420
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:38,881
my opposition to bill [inaudible],
which was a bill that had to do with 

1421
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:42,631
transgender rights and I didn't really 
give a damn about the transgender right 

1422
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:45,751
issue that had nothing to do with it.
What bothered me was that there was an 

1423
01:05:45,751 --> 01:05:49,261
issue of Compelled speech because you 
were required by the ontario human 

1424
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:51,700
rights commission to use the pronouns 
that of the person's choice.

1425
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:52,470
Right.
Otherwise,

1426
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:57,010
absolutely our wellbeing.
That is absolutelY intolerable.

1427
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,520
You know,
I,

1428
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:58,810
I have said,
I said years ago,

1429
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:00,400
okay,
that my book sexual persona,

1430
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,350
which was like a 700 page book,
I said,

1431
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:07,351
that is the biggest sex change in 
history because I okay with my 

1432
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:10,951
transgender issues all don't look to the
magnificent construction of english.

1433
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,660
Okay.
It was the english language.

1434
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:16,180
Okay.
That I seized on the game,

1435
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,400
my identity and my power as a person.
Right.

1436
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,970
And therefore any intrusion into 
english.

1437
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:25,710
Someone told me how to use english.
that's great gift.

1438
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:26,410
Okay.
To me,

1439
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,440
this is absolutely obscene and evil 
government to try to dictate to us how 

1440
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,030
we're going to use this,
this magnificent instrument of english.

1441
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:34,500
Yes,

1442
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,530
absolutely.
And that was for me the breaking point 

1443
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:42,530
because I believe well and I think that 
that's associated with the idea of the 

1444
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:42,530
logos in the west,
you know,

1445
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:47,511
because that's a deep mythological idea 
that the logos is the thing that brings 

1446
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:51,531
order out of chaos through communicative
speech and that that's tightly aligned 

1447
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:54,450
with your soul.
And I don't care if You're an atheist or

1448
01:06:54,451 --> 01:06:55,710
a believer,
it doesn't matter.

1449
01:06:55,711 --> 01:07:00,711
It's still the right language and that 
no one has any right whatsoever under 

1450
01:07:00,711 --> 01:07:02,160
any circumstances to trespass against 
that.

1451
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,430
And so,
but that's okay because that's law in 

1452
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,430
Canada now and so,
but okay.

1453
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,550
So now back to your.
Let's see,

1454
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:10,610
you were making a point about mine.

1455
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,740
I know we wouldn't grow so just because 
it's,

1456
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:22,910
it's interesting to look at these things
from obviously from multiple 

1457
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:26,061
perspectives,
which is another thing the ideologues 

1458
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:26,061
don't do,
rIght?

1459
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:26,700
Because for them everything is one cause
there's one.

1460
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,580
That's how you can tell when you're 
dealing with someone who's ideologically

1461
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:34,581
possessed is they make everything 
attributable to a single cause like 

1462
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:34,581
power.
So,

1463
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:39,070
but so one of the things that's happened
with the nuclear family that's quite 

1464
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,351
interesting too,
is that parents are older and they and 

1465
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:45,870
they have fewer children.
So you could imagine that that hot house

1466
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:49,860
environment in some sense as being 
exaggerated for a bunch of reasons,

1467
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:54,861
one is,
well your child is a lot more valuable 

1468
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:56,430
to you if you're older and you only have
one or two right,

1469
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,380
because you're not going to get another 
chance.

1470
01:07:58,381 --> 01:08:00,540
That's first of all,
you might've had some trouble having the

1471
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:03,810
child to begin with and you're not gonna
get another chance.

1472
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,090
so you've got all your eggs are in one 
basket,

1473
01:08:06,091 --> 01:08:11,091
so to speak.
And then of course children don't have 

1474
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:11,220
the number of siblings they used to 
have.

1475
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:16,430
And one of the things that's really 
useful about having siblings is that 

1476
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:16,430
they,
you in your place,

1477
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:16,670
right?
They,

1478
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,280
their primary socialization agents.
And I mean,

1479
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,360
that can be brutal and that's reflected 
say in the story of cain and abel,

1480
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:28,361
you know,
that that internal household dynamic 

1481
01:08:28,361 --> 01:08:28,550
with siblings can be,
can really become murderous and that has

1482
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,470
to be kept under control.
But I think the,

1483
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:35,970
the hothouse flower person who's,
who's incapable of tolerating any jobs 

1484
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:39,860
or any or any testing,
any dominance hierarchy,

1485
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,810
testing of the sort that you said that 
men do,

1486
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:47,140
part of that's the consequence of being 
raised by older parents who have excess 

1487
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:51,101
resources,
who have no siblings because the child 

1488
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:52,400
is then of course special and that 
specialness.

1489
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:57,610
Well there,
there seems to be an inverse 

1490
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,471
relationship between that specialness 
that's protected and the person's 

1491
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:01,100
robustness and resilience.
And so,

1492
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,620
and then that's caught into or not 
caught in too.

1493
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:05,880
That's,
that's a uh,

1494
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,960
pandered to by the universities,
which insist upon setting up a situation

1495
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:13,130
where no one is ever offended by 
anything,

1496
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:18,730
any of the time.
And that's something I also can't 

1497
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:18,730
understand it all because.

1498
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:19,050
Let me just say that's a huge point you 
just made.

1499
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:24,051
Okay.
Because it's the upper middle class of 

1500
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:25,680
the professional class who posts paul 
and having the children.

1501
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:27,450
Okay.
Because they go to law school,

1502
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:32,570
they go to medical school in India and 
they have the children after their 

1503
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:32,570
settled.
Okay.

1504
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:32,570
In the.
In,

1505
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,090
in a drop.
Okay.

1506
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:34,930
So they're the ones.
Okay.

1507
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,490
What were injected this,
this,

1508
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:40,490
this hypersensitive bourgeois id code 
in,

1509
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,940
into the universities.
Now my,

1510
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,140
my parents were 20 when they married in 
21 when they had me.

1511
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,480
My father was um,
you know,

1512
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:53,580
uh,
when I went to college on the gi bill 

1513
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:53,580
getting out of,
out of world war two.

1514
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,930
So when I was born my father was still 
in college and was sweeping floors and 

1515
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,821
so on.
I am the product of young parents and 

1516
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,430
nature once actually young parents.
Right.

1517
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,080
Because because pregnancy is,
is,

1518
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:06,700
is quicker,
it's safer.

1519
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,180
Okay.
On.

1520
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:08,990
And my parents had the energy.
okay.

1521
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,900
To um,
you know,

1522
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:15,020
this youthful energy that we can do 
spirit that came out of world war two 

1523
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,100
and so on.
I'm part of that.

1524
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:20,160
Then the,
then the only other sibling was born 14 

1525
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:20,670
years later.
My father,

1526
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,671
this point was a college professor,
so she had completely different parents 

1527
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:26,170
than than I did,
so she,

1528
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,070
she has very excellent manners and so I.
She's completely different.

1529
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:29,750
okay.
All right.

1530
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,880
And I'll have all this like moving the 
energy of my parents were just a lot of 

1531
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,240
other teams,
but not today we have this situation.

1532
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:41,430
No,
it's considered heresy to raise this 

1533
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,910
issue that you have have young women are
told,

1534
01:10:41,911 --> 01:10:43,470
okay,
there's one feature for you.

1535
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:44,760
You are a future leader.
Okay.

1536
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,650
You must,
you must move forward.

1537
01:10:46,651 --> 01:10:51,651
Okay.
Four years of college and it perhaps 

1538
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:51,651
into the professional class.

1539
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:52,970
All right,
so it may be the women,

1540
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:57,540
young women's bodies are signaling that 
they want to be known.

1541
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:58,340
Others maybe.
Maybe.

1542
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:03,470
Maybe there are signals coming from the 
body weight of maybe not wanting this,

1543
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,410
this,
this,

1544
01:11:04,411 --> 01:11:06,670
this system of education that was 
devised for men.

1545
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:11,690
Okay.
This being funneled the long channel 

1546
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:11,690
long.
It's nepotism.

1547
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:15,820
Alright.
So young women feel they don't know why 

1548
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,730
they feel they had no sense of identity.
If they,

1549
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:21,731
if they,
if they want to marry and drop out of 

1550
01:11:21,731 --> 01:11:23,991
college and have have a baby,
they will be treated as traitors to 

1551
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:27,531
their class.
What you are future leaders have a baby 

1552
01:11:27,531 --> 01:11:31,230
only working class women would do that.
I find working class women.

1553
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:32,340
Okay.
In general.

1554
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:35,080
Okay.
Far more rounded as personalities.

1555
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:37,560
The way they express themselves 
forcefully.

1556
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,870
They have body language that takes up 
space.

1557
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,880
A man says something to them on the 
street.

1558
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,740
They're right back in their face and so 
on.

1559
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,420
It this,
the bourgeois girls.

1560
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,470
Okay.
Who are taught to.

1561
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:47,610
They're there because they are a 
special.

1562
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:50,160
Okay.
We have to postpone actual life.

1563
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:51,750
okay.
From for all these years,

1564
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:56,930
they see these,
these other girls who are home who 

1565
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:56,930
misjudged the fraternity parties 
setting.

1566
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:00,670
These are the girls who like rotten for 
parental protection and handholding on,

1567
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,720
on the,
on the committee investigating what 

1568
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:05,720
would run on their date and so on and so
forth.

1569
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:05,720
So.
So yes.

1570
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,670
I think that yoU have located.
That's very interesting.

1571
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,080
The idea that the,
these,

1572
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:13,380
these young girls who are so sensitive.
Okay.

1573
01:12:13,381 --> 01:12:15,630
In college,
so I'm able to handle their sex life are

1574
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:20,631
the product of older parents because 
they went through the professional 

1575
01:12:20,631 --> 01:12:20,940
career track.
Yes,

1576
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:25,941
and they are.
They have not had the experience of the 

1577
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:26,190
competitiveness,
you know,

1578
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,610
end up in and teasing of other siblings 
and they don't know how to.

1579
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,060
Well also the thing about young parents 
is they don't care as much as older 

1580
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:38,961
parents and not actually turns out to be
better because what you really want for 

1581
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:41,430
your children is minimum necessary 
intervention.

1582
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:46,460
Right.
And the developmental literature is 

1583
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:46,650
actually quite clear on this.
So if you're at home with your child,

1584
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,800
what the best rule that you can play is 
to be there but not to be interacting 

1585
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,421
with the child all the time.
the child should be off doing whatever 

1586
01:12:56,421 --> 01:12:58,761
it is the children do,
which generally is playing with other 

1587
01:12:58,761 --> 01:12:58,761
children,
right.

1588
01:12:58,761 --> 01:12:59,790
Without it being mediated.
Also by screens and,

1589
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,890
and technology because that's how they 
formulate their identity and that's how 

1590
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:09,051
they learned to play games with other 
people and the parent is supposed to be 

1591
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,591
there as a recourse for the child when 
they go out a little bit farther than 

1592
01:13:12,591 --> 01:13:14,340
they can tolerate in the half to come 
back and get some security.

1593
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:15,600
And so,
but that isn't,

1594
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:20,820
that's especially not what happens.
Two single children because they're 

1595
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,140
basically raised as miniature adults.
So when I wonder too,

1596
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:27,141
like how much of the antipathy towards 
these are dark musings and I would say 

1597
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:32,570
how much of the antipathy towards man 
that's being generated by say college 

1598
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:36,471
age women is a,
a deep repugnance for the role that 

1599
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:40,431
they've been designed.
And a disappointment with the man for 

1600
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:40,431
who,
you know,

1601
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:42,010
like,
you think of those carpathian um,

1602
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,950
or,
or,

1603
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:45,100
or uh,
uh,

1604
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:50,900
I can't remember the culture.
The basic marit marital routine was to 

1605
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,540
ride into the village and grab the bride
and runaway with her on a horse.

1606
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:59,541
Right.
It's like the like the motorcycle gang 

1607
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:00,660
member who rips the too naive woman out 
of girl,

1608
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:02,240
out of the of family.

1609
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,610
There used to be bribed,
stealing.

1610
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:06,780
It was quite,
quite,

1611
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,920
quite widespread.

1612
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:08,470
Right?
Well,

1613
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:13,471
so I kind of wonder if part of the 
reason that modern university age women 

1614
01:14:13,471 --> 01:14:17,311
aren't so art so angry is because that 
fundamental feminine role is actually 

1615
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:20,650
being denied to them and they're.
They're objecting to that at a really,

1616
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:23,190
really fundamental level.
Like a level of,

1617
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,040
of primitive outrage at

1618
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,080
what's happened is the chaos that my 
generation of the sixties be released 

1619
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,610
through the sexual revolution.
I went when I arrived in college in 

1620
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:35,610
1964,
w,

1621
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:38,920
w the colleges were still acting in 
local parentis in place of a parent.

1622
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,790
So my dormitory,
all women's dormitory,

1623
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,940
we women had to sign in at 11:00
at night.

1624
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:50,970
The men could run free the entire night.
So it was my generation of women that 

1625
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:53,950
rose up and said,
give us the same freedom as men have and

1626
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:55,540
the colleges replied,
no,

1627
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,540
I'm in the world is dangerous.
you could be raped.

1628
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,150
We have to protect you against.
Right?

1629
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:01,510
And what we said,
okay,

1630
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,500
was give us the freedom to risk rape.
Okay.

1631
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,600
The,
so what that did,

1632
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,090
today's women don't understand.
It's a freedom that you want.

1633
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:13,850
It's the same freedom that gay men have 
when they go and they pick up a stranger

1634
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:15,250
or someplace they know it's dangerous.

1635
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,710
They know they could end up beaten up or
killed.

1636
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,060
Okay?
But they find it hot.

1637
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,580
If you want freedom,
if you want equality,

1638
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:26,610
okay,
then you have to stop behaving like a 

1639
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:27,340
man.
And so what we did is we gave freedom to

1640
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:29,650
these young women for several 
generations,

1641
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:34,570
but my generation had been raised and a 
far more resilient and robust culture.

1642
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,060
Okay.
We had the strength,

1643
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:41,070
okay.
To know what we wanted and to fight for 

1644
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,591
what we wanted.
These young women have been raised in 

1645
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:43,591
this protective terribly protected ways.
Right?

1646
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:45,850
So I think in some strAnge thing,
you know,

1647
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:51,230
the fashion that all of these demands 
for intrusion from these stalinist 

1648
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,810
committees,
sexual,

1649
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:56,170
you know,
investigating dates and so on.

1650
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,420
It's a way to re institute,
okay,

1651
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:00,760
the rules that my generation through out
the window.

1652
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:05,761
And I.
So I think these young women are 

1653
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:05,761
desperate.

1654
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:06,580
Not only that,
but I have spoken out very strongly in,

1655
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:07,150
you know,
in a,

1656
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:10,120
in a piece I wrote for time magazine 
isn't my most recent book,

1657
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,390
the idea that the raising the drinking 
age in this country.

1658
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:15,100
Okay.
From 18 to 21.

1659
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:16,690
Okay.
It's had a direct result.

1660
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:17,680
Okay.
In these,

1661
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,290
in these disasters of binge drinking 
fraternity parties because to la,

1662
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:27,510
let couch students the way we could go 
out at as freshman have a beer sit any 

1663
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:32,580
protected adult environment,
learn how to have discourse with the 

1664
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,960
opposite sex in,
in a safe environment.

1665
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,710
Right?
And so on.

1666
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,570
And you and,
and the.

1667
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:37,600
And not today.
Okay.

1668
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:42,601
Because because of the stupid role that 
the young people can't even buy a drink 

1669
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:46,530
in a bar until they're 21.
We have these fraternity parties that 

1670
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:47,320
are like the caveman era.
Well,

1671
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:50,150
of course in,
in this modern age disadvantages men,

1672
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,320
gay men want to hook up and men wanted 
to have sex.

1673
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,080
Women don't understand what men want.
Women,

1674
01:16:56,081 --> 01:17:01,081
women I put out because they're hoping 
that maybe the men will continue to be 

1675
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:01,081
interested in them.
Okay.

1676
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:01,880
The man just wants to experience.
Okay.

1677
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,690
That the hormones drive toward Jordan.
To me,

1678
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,270
I,
I've,

1679
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,570
I've theorized.
Okay.

1680
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,470
That the,
you know,

1681
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,260
the sex drive in men is intertwined 
with,

1682
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,110
with hunted pursuit.
Okay.

1683
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,730
Yeah,
I feel absolutely.

1684
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:15,170
This is what women don't understand.
Okay.

1685
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:20,171
If it.
And if women understood what I 

1686
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:20,171
understand from my transgender 
perspective,

1687
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:21,610
right.
These women on the streets.

1688
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,670
Okay.
I'm you.

1689
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,030
I'm obviously,
you know,

1690
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:27,160
but madonna and admirer and you know,
and I,

1691
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,210
I support pornography and prostitution 
so I don't want what I'm about to say.

1692
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,140
The seem conservative and then it isn't.
Okay.

1693
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,510
What I'm saying is the women on the 
street,

1694
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:38,510
young women who are,
who are jogging,

1695
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,050
okay.
With no bra on.

1696
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:45,050
Okay.
Short shorts and have and have any 

1697
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:45,050
earbuds in their ears.
Okay.

1698
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:48,590
Just jogging the long line because I saw
these women do not understand the nature

1699
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:53,591
of the human mind.
They do not understand the nature of 

1700
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:53,591
psychosis.
Okay.

1701
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:55,520
And this intertwining them,
talking about the hunt,

1702
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:59,540
the hunter pursued things.
They're triggering a hunter thing.

1703
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,190
Just what?
What,

1704
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,220
what?
What do what you have talked about in 

1705
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:05,220
terms of the zebra heard.
Okay.

1706
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:10,060
They are triggering the hunt game.
A impulse in psychotic men.

1707
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:11,880
Okay.
I have it here.

1708
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,550
There goes.
I'm very appetizing and,

1709
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:17,210
and totally oblivious animal.
Okay.

1710
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:18,350
Bouncing along here.
Okay.

1711
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:19,280
Sorry.
And we're,

1712
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:22,340
we're in a period now where psychosis is
not understood at all.

1713
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:27,341
Okay.
Then a young women who has had no 

1714
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:27,940
exposure to movies like psycho.
Okay.

1715
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:29,190
Was the,
the,

1716
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,420
you know,
the kind of rapists serial murder thing.

1717
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:36,950
So on the kind of strange dynamic that 
has to do with it with an assault on the

1718
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,270
mother and margo,
you know,

1719
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:38,690
in,
in the,

1720
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,340
in the,
in the mind of the psychotic.

1721
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:43,790
But I think that is an incredible night.
He became these young women are emerging

1722
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:48,791
and going to college and in this 
incredible environment of sec orgiastic 

1723
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,930
sexual experience in fraternity houses.
They're completely unprepared for it.

1724
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:00,140
And,
and so you're getting all this outrage 

1725
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,911
or feminist rhetoric has gotten more and
more extreme in its portrayal of men is 

1726
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,870
evil,
but in fact what we have is a cast is a,

1727
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:09,871
is a chaos in the sexual realm because 
the girls have not been told anything 

1728
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:13,110
real in terms of biological substrate.

1729
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:17,120
There's full of lies about what 
constitutes consent to.

1730
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:22,220
Exactly.
And it's become something that's 

1731
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,210
essentially portrayed linguistically as 
a sequence of progressive contracts,

1732
01:19:24,211 --> 01:19:25,560
which you know,
is.

1733
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:26,190
It's.
Well,

1734
01:19:26,191 --> 01:19:26,970
I think,
you know,

1735
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,971
I've thought for awhile that we're 
living in the delusional fantasy of a 

1736
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:35,301
naive 13 year old girl that's basically 
sums up our culture and I look at all 

1737
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:38,230
these sexual rules that permeate the,
the,

1738
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,490
the academia and I think two things.
The first thing I think As well,

1739
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:46,970
I know because I was an alcohol 
researcher for a long time and you know 

1740
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,560
that fIfty percent of violent crimes are
directly attributable to alcohol.

1741
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:54,561
So if you're a murdered,
there's about a 50 percent chance that 

1742
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:57,201
you're drunk and about a 50 percent 
chance that the person who kills you is 

1743
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:58,170
drunk.
And the alcohol is the only drug that we

1744
01:19:58,171 --> 01:20:00,270
know that actually amplifies aggression.

1745
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,780
It does that in laboratory situations.
Plus it's a great disinhibitor,

1746
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:05,490
right?
so what alcohol does is it,

1747
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:10,970
it doesn't make you to the future 
consequences of your actions because if 

1748
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:13,230
you ask someone who's drunk about the 
consequences of something stupid,

1749
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,510
they can tell you what the consequences 
are,

1750
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,810
but it makes you not care.
And it does that because it's 

1751
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:20,810
technically an exile lytic,
like,

1752
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:23,160
like,
like barbiturates or benzodiazepines.

1753
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:28,161
and it also has a,
as an activating a property for many 

1754
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,200
people who drink.
So it's,

1755
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:33,960
it's a stimulant and a and an anxiolytic
at the same time in a very,

1756
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:36,180
very potent,
very potent for both of them.

1757
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:41,181
And you know,
we put young people together and douse 

1758
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:41,940
them in alcohol,
right at the binge drinking level.

1759
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,120
and then,
which also interferes with memory 

1760
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,071
consolidation,
which of course makes things much more 

1761
01:20:49,071 --> 01:20:51,231
complex.
And then we're surprised when there are 

1762
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:53,631
sexual misadventures and you know,
and then it's also attributed almost 

1763
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:55,540
purely to the predatory element that's,
that's,

1764
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:57,330
uh,
part and parcel of masculinity.

1765
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:02,330
But a true,
a tremenDous amount of that is also 

1766
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:02,330
naive and stupidity,
you know,

1767
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,650
because we expect like eight to 18 year 
old guys,

1768
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,680
especially the ones that aren't,
that haven't been successful with girls,

1769
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:12,681
which is like 85 percent of them because
the successful men are a very small 

1770
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:16,461
percentage of men.
The 85 percent who haven't been 

1771
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:19,731
successful with men or with women,
they don't know what the hell they're 

1772
01:21:19,731 --> 01:21:22,251
doing it all right in part of the reason
they're getting drunk is to garner up 

1773
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:24,840
enough courage to actually make an 
advance.

1774
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,050
Because I think another thing that women
don't understand,

1775
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:33,260
especially with regards to young men,
is just exactly how petrifying a 

1776
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:37,710
attractive woman who's of say,
somewhat higher status actually is to a 

1777
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:42,771
young guy in it.
There's lots of guys that wrIte me 

1778
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:43,320
constantly and people that I've worked 
with that are so terrified of women,

1779
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:45,180
they can't even talk to them.
it's very,

1780
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:45,900
very common.

1781
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,730
Well,
I take a very firm position,

1782
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:53,760
which is that I want college 
administration so state totally out of 

1783
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,440
the social lives of the students.
If a crime is committed,

1784
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:58,680
it should be reported to the police.
I've been writing now for 20,

1785
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:00,310
25 years now.
Right,

1786
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,070
but,
but it's not the business of any college

1787
01:22:03,071 --> 01:22:07,420
administration to take any notice of 
what the students say to each other,

1788
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,030
say to each other as well as do with 
each other.

1789
01:22:10,031 --> 01:22:12,750
Okay.
I want it to totally stop is fascism?

1790
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:12,820
Yeah.

1791
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,000
The worst.
I agree.

1792
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:14,790
While you're sitting,
it's.

1793
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,520
I think it's fascism of the worst kind 
because it's an.

1794
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,040
It's a new kind of fascism,
you know,

1795
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:23,040
it's,
it's partly generated by legislation.

1796
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:26,400
So the like the title nine men memo that
was written in 2011.

1797
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,470
I recently got a copy of that god damn 
thing.

1798
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:30,810
That was one polluting bit of 
legislation.

1799
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:35,811
That was.
That memo basically told universities 

1800
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:35,910
that unless they set up a parallel court
system,

1801
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:37,530
they were going to be denied central 
funding.

1802
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,810
It is absolutely unbelievable.

1803
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,550
We had a ball and it will in the 
leftists are supporting list.

1804
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,460
I know,
I know.

1805
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,150
That shows.
There is no authentic campus.

1806
01:22:47,151 --> 01:22:48,830
Leftism I'm sorry.
It's a fraud.

1807
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,340
Okay.
Let me think.

1808
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:53,190
The faculty should be fighting the 
administration.

1809
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:58,260
You're on this federal federal 
regulation of how we're supposed to 

1810
01:22:58,821 --> 01:22:59,480
behave on camp.

1811
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:04,820
Well,
how can you be so how can you be so 

1812
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,141
naive and foolish to think that taking 
an organization like the university,

1813
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:12,601
which already has plenty to do and 
forcing it to become a pseudo legal 

1814
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:19,051
system that parallels the legal system,
could possibly be anything but utterly 

1815
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:24,271
catastrophic.
It would mean you have to know 

1816
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:26,220
absolutely nothing about the legal 
system and about the tremendous period 

1817
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:30,181
of evolution that produced what's 
actually a stellar system and an 

1818
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:34,321
adversarial system that protects the 
rights of the accused and of the end of 

1819
01:23:34,321 --> 01:23:38,281
the victim and to replace that with an 
ad hoc bureaucracy that has pretty much 

1820
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,770
essentially the same degree of power as 
the court system with absolutely none of

1821
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:44,330
the training and none of the guarantees 
and to get real cards.

1822
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:50,670
That piece that I wrote about date rape,
it was in january of 1991 a news day got

1823
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:54,070
the most controversial thing I ever 
wrote in my entire career.

1824
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:59,071
I attack the entire thing and I demanded
the college has standing back and get 

1825
01:23:59,071 --> 01:24:00,760
out of the social lives of the students,
so on and people.

1826
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:05,870
The reaction people tried to recall,
they called the president of my 

1827
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,430
university,
tried to get me fired.

1828
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,110
You can believe in hysteria.
Okay.

1829
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,600
Right.
I can believe it.

1830
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:14,100
Yeah.
It won't cost them anything and it.

1831
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:17,120
If anything that says to women,
okay,

1832
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:22,260
but they should be responsible for their
own choices is regarded as reactionary.

1833
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:24,750
Are they kidding me?
Okay.

1834
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,730
This is such a big trail of authentic 
feminism in my view.

1835
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:33,530
Well,
it's the ultimate betrayal of authentic 

1836
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:33,530
feminism because it's.
It,

1837
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:36,970
it.
It's an invitation of all the things 

1838
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,910
that you might be paranoid about with 
regards to the patriarchy back into your

1839
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:39,480
life.
Right?

1840
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,670
It's an insistence that the most 
intrusive part of the tie,

1841
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:45,900
ironical,
king come and take control over the most

1842
01:24:45,901 --> 01:24:48,190
intimate details of your life.
Incredible.

1843
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:54,150
On the assumption is that that's going 
to make your life better rather than 

1844
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:54,150
worse.
Right?

1845
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,450
Yeah,
and not to mention this idea of,

1846
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:55,710
you know,
this,

1847
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,370
the stages of verbal consent as if,
as if your impulse is based in the body,

1848
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:05,430
have anything to do with words.
So I mean that's the whole point is you 

1849
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,490
know,
you're allowed to abandon,

1850
01:25:06,491 --> 01:25:07,080
okay.
You know,

1851
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,830
that part of the brain that's so,
and it traveled with words.

1852
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,340
I mean

1853
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:18,060
actually a marker of,
of lack of social ability to have to do 

1854
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:21,761
that because if you're a sophisticated,
it's not like if you're dancing with 

1855
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:22,670
someone,
it's not like you call out the moves,

1856
01:25:22,671 --> 01:25:24,320
right?
If you have to do that,

1857
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:25,550
well then you're,
you're,

1858
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:27,920
you're,
you're more worse than the neophyte,

1859
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:32,970
right?
You're an awkward neophyte fight and 

1860
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:32,970
anybody with any sense should get the 
hell away from you.

1861
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:37,660
And so if you're reduced to the point 
where you have to verbally negotiate 

1862
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:41,021
every element of intimate interaction,
then what a downer that eds.

1863
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:42,100
But uh,
what I,

1864
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,810
what an unbelievably,
what would you call it?

1865
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,710
Naive and pathological view of the 
manner in which human beings interact.

1866
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,540
There's no sophistication in that.

1867
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:55,860
Well,
what I'm worried about also in this age 

1868
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:55,860
of social media,
uh,

1869
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:56,350
I've noticed as a,
as a teacher in the classroom,

1870
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:00,970
that the young people are so used to 
communicating now by cell phone.

1871
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:01,960
Okay.
My iphone,

1872
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:07,900
that's,
they're losing body language and facial 

1873
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:07,900
expressions.
Okay.

1874
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:11,420
Which I think is going to compound the 
problem with these dating,

1875
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,530
uh,
encounters.

1876
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,560
Okay.
Because the ability to read the human 

1877
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:17,560
face and into,
into,

1878
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,181
into read little tiny inflections of 
emotion was I think my generation got 

1879
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:24,110
that from looking at great foreign films
with,

1880
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:29,130
with our,
with our long takes because you'd have 

1881
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:31,190
jon morrow and catherine deneuve in like
a potential romantic encounters and you 

1882
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,600
could use to the tiniest little little 
inflections that,

1883
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:38,030
that signal communication or sexual 
readiness or,

1884
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:40,720
or irony or skepticism or distance or 
whatever.

1885
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,930
But the inability to read the other 
people's intentions.

1886
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:49,931
Okay.
That I think this is going to be a 

1887
01:26:49,931 --> 01:26:49,931
disaster.
I'm a guy,

1888
01:26:49,931 --> 01:26:49,931
I just,
I just noticed that,

1889
01:26:49,931 --> 01:26:50,990
um,
how year by year,

1890
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,750
okay.
The students are becoming much more flat

1891
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,840
affect and they in themselves complained
that they'll sit in the same room with 

1892
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,170
someone and be texting to each other.
Okay.

1893
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:01,170
Yup.
Yeah.

1894
01:27:01,171 --> 01:27:06,171
Well there's a,
there's a piece of evidence to that 

1895
01:27:06,171 --> 01:27:08,181
supports that to some degree.
So women with brothers are less likely 

1896
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:12,201
to get raped.
And the reason for that is that they've 

1897
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:13,530
learned that nonverbal language deeply.
Right.

1898
01:27:13,531 --> 01:27:14,400
And they can,
they can,

1899
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,600
they can spot the.

1900
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:16,940
Okay.
But I,

1901
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,320
I have noticed,
okay.

1902
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:19,270
Uh,
in my,

1903
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,410
in my career.
Okay.

1904
01:27:20,411 --> 01:27:23,670
That the women who have many brothers.
Okay.

1905
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,410
Are very good.
Okay.

1906
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:29,230
As administrators and as business 
people,

1907
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:33,080
because they don't take men seriously.
Okay.

1908
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,580
They regard but they,
they,

1909
01:27:34,581 --> 01:27:35,710
they,
they saw their brothers.

1910
01:27:35,711 --> 01:27:37,150
They were brothers are jokes.
Okay.

1911
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,150
But they know how to control men.
Okay.

1912
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:41,110
While it,
while they still like men.

1913
01:27:41,111 --> 01:27:42,460
Okay.
They admired man.

1914
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:47,510
Alright.
So this is something that I have seen 

1915
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,510
repeatedly

1916
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:50,220
that would be also reflective of the 
problem of fewer and fewer siblings.

1917
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,440
Yes,
that's right.

1918
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:52,080
Okay.
Yeah.

1919
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,500
Yeah.
And I've noticed this in publishing.

1920
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:55,670
Okay.
That's that the,

1921
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:56,430
um,
the,

1922
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,000
the women who have this job,
the job of publicist.

1923
01:27:59,001 --> 01:28:04,001
Okay.
And rise to the top is as manager of 

1924
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:04,001
publicity.
Okay.

1925
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:04,830
Their ability to take charge of men and,
and,

1926
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,840
and they're humorous men that like the 
end of in and they have great 

1927
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,571
relationships with men because they 
don't have the sense of resentment and 

1928
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:13,571
in,
in,

1929
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:16,310
in worry and anxiety and they don't see 
men as aggressors.

1930
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,110
Okay.
Right.

1931
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,390
And I think it's another thing too,
is that as feminism,

1932
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,410
um,
you know,

1933
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:26,411
uh,
moved into its presence in assistant 

1934
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:26,411
videology.
Okay.

1935
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:28,680
It has tended to denigrate motherhood 
as,

1936
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,550
as a lesser order of human experience.
And,

1937
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:33,190
and to enshrine,
of course abortion.

1938
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:38,210
I am 100 percent of abortion rights.
I belonged to planned parenthood for 

1939
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:40,100
years until I finally rejected it as a 
branch of the democratic party,

1940
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,300
my party and so on.

1941
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,180
Um,
but,

1942
01:28:42,181 --> 01:28:44,900
but as motherhood became excluded,
as,

1943
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:46,700
as feminism became obsessed.
Okay.

1944
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:48,030
With the,
with the,

1945
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,850
with a professional woman.
Okay.

1946
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:54,170
I feel that the lessons are that mothers
learn had been lost.

1947
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:54,800
Okay.
Yeah.

1948
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:55,670
To to,
to,

1949
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,660
to,
to feminism,

1950
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:58,780
which is okay if,
if,

1951
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,530
if the,
the mothers who who bear boy children.

1952
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,370
Okay.
Understand the fragility of men,

1953
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,870
the fragility and boys.
They understand it.

1954
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:09,240
They don't,
they don't seem to boys.

1955
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,080
And then as a menace they understand 
that the greatest strength of women.

1956
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:18,140
Okay.
So there's this tenderness and 

1957
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,451
connectedness between the,
between the mother and the and the boy 

1958
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:20,451
child.
Okay.

1959
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:22,860
W when motherhood is part of the 
experience of,

1960
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:27,420
of women who are discussing gender.
So what we have today is this,

1961
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:32,421
this does gender.
The lg has risen up on campuses where 

1962
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:32,421
we're all.
None of the.

1963
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:33,660
None of the girls know the students have
married.

1964
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,310
None of them had children.
Okay.

1965
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,510
And you have,
you have women.

1966
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:41,511
Some of them have had children,
but a lot of them are lesbians or like 

1967
01:29:41,511 --> 01:29:41,730
or like arguing or like professional 
women and so on.

1968
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,760
Okay.
So there's this whole tenderness and 

1969
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:46,760
forgiven.
Forgiveness.

1970
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,800
Okay.
And encouragement that women do to two 

1971
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:50,800
boys.
Okay.

1972
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,430
The fragility,
they don't understand this 

1973
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,430
hypersensitivity of boys.
It's not understood.

1974
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,430
Okay.
Instead button.

1975
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,230
Boys are seen as somehow a more 
privileged.

1976
01:29:58,231 --> 01:29:59,340
Okay.
And somehow,

1977
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:00,320
you know,
their,

1978
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:00,900
their,
their,

1979
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,690
their energy level is interpreted as 
aggression.

1980
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,850
Okay.
Potential violence and so on.

1981
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:06,740
Okay.
Alright.

1982
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:07,360
Uh,
so I,

1983
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:10,830
I think that that is what we would do 
better.

1984
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:12,030
Okay.
If we would have.

1985
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,360
I have proposed.
Okay.

1986
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:17,110
That colleges should allow.
The moment a woman is entered,

1987
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,210
it's entered.
Okay.

1988
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,860
She has entrusted at college for life.
Okay.

1989
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:25,180
And that she,
that she should be free to leave.

1990
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,850
Okay.
To have babies when she,

1991
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:31,851
when her body wants that babies,
when it's healthy to have them and then 

1992
01:30:31,851 --> 01:30:35,271
return have heaven had the occasional 
course again build up credits and 

1993
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:39,210
fathers.
I mean you might be able to do it as as 

1994
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,210
well and so on,
to get married.

1995
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,440
Women,
women with children into the classroom.

1996
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:44,310
The moment that happens and it's 
happened after world war ii.

1997
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:49,330
Okay.
We've hit a lot of married guys in the 

1998
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:49,330
classroom.
Okay.

1999
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:49,330
And so on.
Not yet.

2000
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:53,500
Not that many women experience of a 
married person with a family talking 

2001
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:58,341
about gender,
but most of them gender stuff will be 

2002
01:30:58,341 --> 01:30:58,341
laughed out of the room.
Okay.

2003
01:30:58,341 --> 01:31:01,130
If you had a real mother in there who 
would experienced childbirth and had had

2004
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,240
rate and it was raising boys and 
consumer,

2005
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:07,620
why do I think that that's also 
something that has led to this,

2006
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:12,621
this,
this incredible art artificiality and 

2007
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:12,621
uh,
and hysteria.

2008
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:13,650
Okay.
Feminist rhetoric.

2009
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:19,900
There's,
there's another strange element to that 

2010
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,550
which is that on the one hand,
the radical feminist types,

2011
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:27,551
the neo marxist postmodernists are,
are very much opposed to the patriarchy,

2012
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,020
let's say.
And that's,

2013
01:31:30,021 --> 01:31:32,390
that unidimensional ideological 
represented

2014
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,680
mean perhaps the word can be applied to 
republican rome and that's it.

2015
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,160
Okay.

2016
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:42,610
Well,
and then maybe it can be applied 

2017
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:44,081
usefully to certain kinds of tyranny,
but not to a society that's actually 

2018
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:44,081
functional.

2019
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,050
Victorian england one,
arguably.

2020
01:31:46,051 --> 01:31:47,390
Okay.
But other than that,

2021
01:31:47,391 --> 01:31:50,280
and to use the word patriarchy and that 
ended at a slapdash way.

2022
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,770
So feel emma tourists are absolutely,
absolutely.

2023
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:57,790
You know,
just shows people know nothing about 

2024
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:57,790
history.
Whatever have you ever had,

2025
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:57,790
had done no reading.

2026
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:01,960
So.
And so what confuses me about is that 

2027
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,651
despite the fact that the patriarch is 
viewed as this essentially evil entity 

2028
01:32:04,651 --> 01:32:09,570
and that that's associated with the 
masculine energy that built this 

2029
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,530
oppressive structure,
the antithesis of that,

2030
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:14,410
which would actually be femininity as 
far as I can tell,

2031
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:19,411
which is tightly associated with care 
and with child rearing is also 

2032
01:32:19,411 --> 01:32:23,251
denigrated.
So it's like the only proper role for 

2033
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:26,641
women to adopt is a patriarchal role 
despite the fact that the patriarchy is 

2034
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:30,931
something that's entirely corrupt.
So the hypothesis seems to be that the 

2035
01:32:30,931 --> 01:32:33,130
patriarchy would be just fine if women 
ran it.

2036
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,850
So no changes.
It's just that would just be a 

2037
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:38,860
transformation of leadership and somehow
that would,

2038
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:44,010
that would rectify the fundamental 
problem even though it's hypothetically 

2039
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:44,650
supposed to be structural.
Okay.

2040
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:47,170
So I'm going to close with something.
So,

2041
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:52,740
you know,
there are elements in my character that 

2042
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:52,740
are optimistic.

2043
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:52,900
You know,
I've,

2044
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,160
I've looked,
for example,

2045
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:59,161
I worked for the un committee and on the
relationship between economic 

2046
01:32:59,161 --> 01:32:59,230
development,
sustainability,

2047
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:01,960
and I found out a variety of things that
were very optimistic.

2048
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:03,550
Like the fact that,
you know,

2049
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:08,620
tom set out to have poverty between 2000
and 2015 worldwide and actually hit that

2050
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:11,020
by about 2010.
Right?

2051
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:16,021
So we're in the period of the fastest 
transformation of the bottom strata of 

2052
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:20,101
the world's population into something 
approximating middleclass that's ever 

2053
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:23,921
occurred.
And there's all these great 

2054
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:25,621
technological innovations on the horizon
and it looks to me like things could go 

2055
01:33:25,621 --> 01:33:30,360
extraordinarily well if we were careful,
but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's 

2056
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:35,221
me.
I'm pessimistic because I also see that 

2057
01:33:35,221 --> 01:33:37,831
there's five or six things happening,
all of which appear at the level of 

2058
01:33:37,831 --> 01:33:39,580
catastrophe that are all happening at 
the same time.

2059
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:44,581
And so one of the things that I'd like 
to ask you is like what do you see 

2060
01:33:44,581 --> 01:33:48,721
happening in the next 10 years in the,
in the universities are in culture at 

2061
01:33:48,721 --> 01:33:52,441
large and I mean you just put forward a 
proposal for the universities for the 

2062
01:33:52,441 --> 01:33:53,020
treatment of women,
which I think is very interesting.

2063
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,300
One because women do have a different 
timeframe than men,

2064
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,870
but like what the hell is the proper way
forward?

2065
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:02,620
I've been encouraging young men to tell 
the truth and to take responsibility and

2066
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:04,840
there's a huge market for that message,
but,

2067
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:09,940
but I'm not convinced by any stretch of 
the imagination that it's enough.

2068
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:13,720
What like when you look forward and you 
try to be optimistic,

2069
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:14,890
what the hell do you see?

2070
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,550
Well,
and in the largest scale,

2071
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:23,780
um,
I'm concerned about the future western 

2072
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,251
culture because as a student of history,
it looks too much to me like ancient 

2073
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:27,740
rome.
Okay.

2074
01:34:27,741 --> 01:34:30,130
Which became overexpanded,
uh,

2075
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:33,370
which became a,
it was at the mercy of a bureaucratic,

2076
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:35,190
um,
uh,

2077
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,600
the creep.
Okay.

2078
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:39,770
And can you imagine one of yesterday,
right?

2079
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:45,170
And in and roman identity eventually got
blurred.

2080
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:46,030
Okay.
In,

2081
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,860
in the incorporation of so many 
different cultures,

2082
01:34:48,861 --> 01:34:51,290
which at first seemed like a healthy 
kind of multiculturalism,

2083
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,350
but eventually overexpand and simply 
collapse of its own way.

2084
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:55,220
But I,
I,

2085
01:34:55,221 --> 01:35:00,221
and I,
so I am concerned what the weather 

2086
01:35:00,221 --> 01:35:03,400
western culture is in a rapid decline.
I think it would be very easy because we

2087
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:07,170
are so interconnected and so overcomplex
very easy,

2088
01:35:07,171 --> 01:35:08,840
you know,
to bring it to ruin.

2089
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:11,210
It would only take one major natural 
disaster,

2090
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,500
you know,
to do that,

2091
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,150
but the university themselves,
I mean,

2092
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:16,970
I think people are all of a sudden in 
the United States,

2093
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:22,210
much more attentive to issues of 
political correctness because of the 

2094
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,260
riots at berkeley,
which was the,

2095
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,430
you know,
which was the capital of free speech.

2096
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,650
I mean,
the free speech movement happened in the

2097
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:35,650
spring before I entered college in 1964 
to one of the great principles and 

2098
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:39,740
inspirational stories of my entire life.
Mario savio was an assertion of,

2099
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:45,130
of the,
of the supremacy of free thought and 

2100
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:45,130
free speech.
These.

2101
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:45,130
Okay.
I,

2102
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:46,940
uh,
so I think that perhaps,

2103
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,200
you know,
we might just have turned a corner,

2104
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,280
but it's going to take a very,
very long time for the university to be 

2105
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,220
reformed.
I feel that the cafeteria menu,

2106
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:55,920
okay,
of,

2107
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:58,220
of the university curriculum has to be 
abandoned.

2108
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,350
That we must return to historical,
uh,

2109
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:05,550
courses that begin in the earliest 
period and this donation,

2110
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:07,310
antiquity,
in order to give perspective,

2111
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:07,670
you know,
to,

2112
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:12,671
to our,
to our present an analysis of our 

2113
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:14,530
president at culture.
I want a 50 slash 50 to 75 percent of 

2114
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,270
college administrators fired.
Okay.

2115
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,380
And the money be transferred over to,
um,

2116
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,110
to,
to faculty into libraries,

2117
01:36:21,111 --> 01:36:22,540
into,
into instruction.

2118
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,690
Okay.
Um,

2119
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,650
I,
I think that,

2120
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,480
um,
you know,

2121
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:29,570
obviously the way things are being,
people are being trained right now,

2122
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:31,450
including at the public school level.
Okay.

2123
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:34,040
Is I think that I think the public 
school level has gone to hell.

2124
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:34,520
And when,
when,

2125
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:34,880
when,
when,

2126
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,010
when my mother came,
you know,

2127
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:38,730
came to United States at age of six.
They were,

2128
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,760
the old public school system was very 
strict and therefore she has an 

2129
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,610
excellent education,
you know,

2130
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:45,930
and um,
you know,

2131
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:50,950
did got all a's in her,
in her even though she started out in 

2132
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,040
not speaking english,
spoke without an accent,

2133
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:52,670
etc.
Okay.

2134
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:55,880
So today this,
this kind of feel good.

2135
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,980
The public school education,
which is,

2136
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:00,800
which is a form of ideology in our 
nation right now.

2137
01:37:00,801 --> 01:37:02,870
so it's all about the no bullying.
Okay.

2138
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:07,871
And so,
and not about anything seriously about 

2139
01:37:07,871 --> 01:37:07,871
no bullying.
Yes.

2140
01:37:07,871 --> 01:37:07,940
Yeah.
So I mean,

2141
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:13,140
I can tell them in my own students,
I mean I've been teaching for 46 years 

2142
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:15,380
so I can tell them this slow degradation
of public school education.

2143
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:20,381
Like I said,
they have to the point now that the 

2144
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:22,750
students have absolutely no sense of 
world geography of world history and 

2145
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:26,740
they know absolutely nothing.
They don't know anything about wars and 

2146
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,430
the reality,
the barbaric reality of most of human 

2147
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:30,430
history.
Okay.

2148
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:34,700
And what are triggers?
What a fantastic culture we live in.

2149
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:37,460
And so now identity,
identity politics itself has just got to

2150
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:38,900
stop.
I mean it was important.

2151
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:43,100
Once again,
I was a rebel against the wasps.

2152
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,730
Had gemini.
Okay.

2153
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,820
New white anglo saxon,
protestant gemini.

2154
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,610
In american culture it was,
it was suffocating.

2155
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:54,611
I,
I was raised in the 19 fifties when 

2156
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:55,650
wasps controlled corporations and,
and,

2157
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,880
and education and politics and so on.

2158
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,420
And so identity politics was necessary 
once.

2159
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:03,540
Okay.
How do we asserted gay rights?

2160
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:08,541
Okay.
And was it was stonewall rebellion of 

2161
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:08,541
1969.
We assert,

2162
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:09,310
we asserted okay.
The women's rights with a,

2163
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:12,450
with the rebirth of second wave feminism
in the late 19 sixties.

2164
01:38:12,451 --> 01:38:14,220
Okay,
but this endless,

2165
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:19,221
okay,
preoccupation with with a a fragmented 

2166
01:38:19,221 --> 01:38:21,831
Identity,
we must return to the authentic that 

2167
01:38:21,831 --> 01:38:21,831
needs six.
His vision,

2168
01:38:21,831 --> 01:38:25,080
which is about identity coming from 
consciousness which transcends gender,

2169
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:30,200
which transcends all these divisions of 
race and ethnicity.

2170
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:32,190
Okay.
Consciousness itself.

2171
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:37,220
Okay.
Right now there's no sense of that any 

2172
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:37,220
longer and that's what the 19 sixties.

2173
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:42,610
That is a complete abandonment of 
personal responsibility because that 

2174
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:47,390
consciousness,
I think symbolically and I got a lot of 

2175
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:47,390
this from yoga and also for american 
government.

2176
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:48,780
I mean that's the great logos of the 
west,

2177
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:50,550
right?
That's the transcendent principle,

2178
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:55,551
which is his respect for the primacy of 
individual consciousness and what goes 

2179
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:58,290
along with that primarily isn't 
individual rights.

2180
01:38:58,291 --> 01:39:03,291
Although that's built into it.
I mean that's the reason we have 

2181
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:03,291
individual rights is for respect for 
that,

2182
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:08,270
but the responsibility that comes along 
with being an individual instead of the 

2183
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:09,420
member of some group,
especially in victimized group,

2184
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:14,421
which is like the assure.
I wrote an article with one of my 

2185
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:16,770
students who had toured the mass grave 
sites and in the former yugoslavia,

2186
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:21,771
you know,
and have been exposed to that sort of 

2187
01:39:21,771 --> 01:39:23,901
thing and one of the things that our 
research indicated was that the best 

2188
01:39:23,901 --> 01:39:28,251
predictor of genocide is a victimization
on the part of the group that produces 

2189
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:28,251
the genocide.

2190
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:33,290
Right.
A sense of an accelerated sense of 

2191
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:33,290
victimization and then it's,
well,

2192
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:35,340
we get them before they get us.
So when everyone's being taught now that

2193
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:38,280
they're a victim and then no one seems 
to have any sense that,

2194
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:43,580
you know,
that's part of the essential tragedy of 

2195
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,681
being that life is suffering and that 
and that and that and that and that the 

2196
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:48,030
world rests on a foundation of 
suffering.

2197
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:53,031
It's nothing to take personally and it's
something to take responsibility for it 

2198
01:39:53,031 --> 01:39:56,811
instead of blaming and,
and resentment and all of the things 

2199
01:39:56,811 --> 01:39:57,570
that have polluted our universities and 
our culture.

2200
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:00,250
Well.
And then they'll also the abandonment of

2201
01:40:00,251 --> 01:40:01,080
the,
um,

2202
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:02,770
of,
of the cannon.

2203
01:40:02,771 --> 01:40:04,110
Okay.
The people you know,

2204
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:07,660
asserted that the canon was the product 
of bias.

2205
01:40:07,661 --> 01:40:08,350
And again,
the va,

2206
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:09,100
you know,
have a,

2207
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:13,390
have a provincial elitists and so on,
but in point of fact,

2208
01:40:13,391 --> 01:40:14,920
as a student of history of the arts,
okay,

2209
01:40:14,921 --> 01:40:17,870
I can,
I can assure people that the canon.

2210
01:40:17,871 --> 01:40:20,280
Okay.
Oh the overwhelmingly so is,

2211
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,170
is the result of what artists have 
determined.

2212
01:40:23,171 --> 01:40:23,680
Okay,
we,

2213
01:40:23,681 --> 01:40:24,370
we,
we,

2214
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:29,140
we say a work is important.
It's canonical because artists following

2215
01:40:29,141 --> 01:40:29,740
it.
Okay.

2216
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:34,741
We're influenced by it and we have this 
beautiful cascading tradition of 

2217
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:34,780
influence.
All right?

2218
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,500
So that's another part of the 
philistinism okay.

2219
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,740
Of current education to,
to,

2220
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,420
to believe that there are these external
reasons.

2221
01:40:43,421 --> 01:40:44,070
Okay.
For,

2222
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:49,100
for the why a work last,
why a work written 500 years ago or a 

2223
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:51,610
thousand years ago has global relevance

2224
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:54,100
as if it's some sort of political that's

2225
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:59,100
based on power as if anybody could even 
manage that no matter how nefarious 

2226
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,710
world.
But also,

2227
01:41:00,711 --> 01:41:03,120
you know,
we read in the sixties you had the,

2228
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,030
had the idea,
okay,

2229
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:09,080
there wasn't like a human human 
sensibility that transcendent individual

2230
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:14,910
nations and solid and that and that 
there was this like rubric for cosmic 

2231
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:16,750
consciousness.
Okay.

2232
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:22,070
This,
this sense of the universe as a whole 

2233
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,930
and just to see the human being in 
relationship to great eternal principles

2234
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:27,820
of life and death,
mortality and so on.

2235
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,020
Whereas marxism is blind.
Marxism is very narrow.

2236
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:34,110
All it sees as a society.
Okay?

2237
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:37,690
It says nothing beyond society.
It doesn't seem nature.

2238
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,670
Okay?
Mean it's absolutely mad.

2239
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,430
Are you going to have a system being 
taught,

2240
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:43,510
okay,
in universities,

2241
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:44,080
right?
Which,

2242
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:44,650
which,
which,

2243
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,060
which thinks that this tiny thing of 
society.

2244
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:52,070
Okay.
Compared to the enormity and beauty of 

2245
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,070
nature.
Okay.

2246
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,080
It shouldn't take all of our,
all of our,

2247
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:55,510
you know,
absorb all of our energy and attention.

2248
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,230
So,
I mean,

2249
01:41:56,231 --> 01:41:59,170
I just think that there's like a 
parochialism and provincialism,

2250
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:00,350
uh,
you know,

2251
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:00,960
and it,
it,

2252
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,740
it,
and now all kinds of,

2253
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:03,240
um,
you know,

2254
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:07,420
systematized elitism in our current 
education.

2255
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:10,360
I just got to be rooted out and I want 
to return to basics.

2256
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:15,540
Great.
Simplicity's and I have all these 

2257
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:16,170
faculty members teaching their little 
tiny courses that have to,

2258
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,400
has to do with their own specialty.
That's got to stop.

2259
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:23,450
And people,
people can pursue whatever they want in 

2260
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:23,450
their private research scholars.
Okay.

2261
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:27,900
Certainly that's necessary,
but they must teach in the core 

2262
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:27,900
curriculum.
Uh,

2263
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,340
and,
and,

2264
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:33,350
and,
and people must decide what is crucial 

2265
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:33,880
for an educated person to know.
I do want a multicultural.

2266
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,920
I do want a global curriculum like I 
want.

2267
01:42:35,921 --> 01:42:37,720
I want all the cultures taught.
Okay?

2268
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:39,970
Right.
This is not the answer.

2269
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Martin marxism,
this neo marxism in the university's 

2270
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,000
okay.
Is simply,

2271
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,690
it's lazy.
It's a lazy way to assert 

2272
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,591
multiculturalism without actually doing 
the research and the study of other 

2273
01:42:52,591 --> 01:42:54,730
cultures.
Okay.

2274
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:55,730
Alright,
good.

2275
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:58,940
One to close on.
We agreed on everything I knew.

2276
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,390
All right.
Great.
