1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,790
Okay,

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,780
it's looking good here today with Gregg 
Hurwitz,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
who's a novelist and a screenwriter and 
a comic book writer and a variety of 

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,290
other things as well.
And uh,

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,690
we're going to talk a little bit about 
his latest book,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,300
the nowhere man,
and then we're going to talk to him 

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,810
about writing more generally.
That's the plan anyways.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,370
So how are you doing?
Great.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,470
I'm doing well,
thank you.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,920
So why don't you start by telling us a 
little bit about your new book and then 

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:43,920
about who you are.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,050
Well,
my new book,

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,690
I started a new series with my last 
book,

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,730
um,
and usually I write standalone 

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:54,730
thrillers,
but my last book was based on,

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,090
uh,
I've,

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,220
I've sort of done a lot of really dumb 
things in the name of research over the 

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,050
years.
So I've gone undercover to mind control 

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,050
bolts.
I've gone up and done airplanes,

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,900
I've snuck on a demolition ranges with 
navy seals and blowing up cars.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,320
And one of the things that kept coming 
up when I dealt with a lot of the SPEC 

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,221
ops guys were how these off the books 
programs were implemented over the 

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,950
years.
The sort of history beneath the history 

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,410
that we're all aware of and I got really
interested in this and I thought about a

25
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:28,411
character who was taken out of foster 
homes that the age of 12.

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,930
This is a program called the orphan 
program and basically raised up to be 

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,800
assassins to be their full training.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,050
It's their full life and that's orphan 
x.

29
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,450
that's the first book in the series.
And so in the second book,

30
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:42,370
the one that's just come out called the 
nowhere man.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,120
This acid is taken by somebody who 
doesn't know who he is,

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,340
but want something from him and he's 
taken off and spirited off out to this 

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,121
remote chateau.
He doesn't know where it is and the 

34
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:00,811
people don't know,
have no idea what his real identity is 

35
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,991
or who he is.
And they think that he's trapped in 

36
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,451
there with them.
And in fact they're trapped in there 

37
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:09,391
with him and they're soon going to 
realize that they have a major problem 

38
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:12,121
on their hands.
And so it's the second and the folding 

39
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:12,250
out of this new character.
His name is Evan Smoke.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,110
So this is the first time that you've 
written a series.

41
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,060
I know it's the second time you've 
written a series,

42
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,540
is that right?

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Yeah.
I heard a series early in my career and 

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,680
then I went,
I've,

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,050
I went about nine books with Tiana loans
and then I returned to wet.

46
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,540
And part of that is,
it takes so long.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,900
I mean the majority of my waking hours 
I'm spending inside of manuscripting 

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,681
with a character like I spend more time 
with my characters who were fictional 

49
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,341
that I do with my wife and kids.
And so it took me years to find your 

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,040
characters or less complicated,
which is actually one of the themes of,

51
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,940
uh,
of the books.

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,760
Um,
one of the ways in which,

53
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:57,761
uh,
the complications that arise from 

54
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,861
intimacy because my character was,
I was raised with the veil of 

55
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,240
perfection.
You know,

56
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,340
a lot of the notions that I played with 
him.

57
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:06,220
I came to when I was writing on,
on Batman.

58
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,221
I wrote Batman Comics for a couple of 
years and there were some notions in 

59
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:11,221
there,
the interest in me,

60
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,230
and one of them was the balance between 
perfection and intimacy.

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,260
That was my main focus with Batman 
because part of the reason why I liked 

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,240
that man so much is you know he doesn't 
have a magic ring light green lantern.

63
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:27,241
He can't fly like superman.
He's just a human who represents the 

64
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,990
pinnacle of what can be accomplished 
through sheer discipline.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,230
But part of why that works is his 
parents are dead.

66
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,090
He's not married,
he has no kids.

67
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,130
He lives up in Maine,
in Wayne Manor,

68
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,490
and he's completely undisturbed by 
everyone and everything so we can hone 

69
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,271
it.
And the more that you let people into 

70
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:45,271
your life and the more that you allow 
intimacy in your life,

71
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:50,090
the more complications come.
That sort of detract from this previous 

72
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,090
notion of perfection.

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,460
I've got a question about that.
So that seems to me to reflect in some 

74
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:03,031
sense the problem,
maybe the different problems or maybe 

75
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,780
the different orientation of of men and 
women.

76
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,250
So it's possible for men too,
and I think many men can do this too,

77
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,580
is to sacrifice everything,
including intimacy to become really good

78
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,650
at one thing.
Whereas women,

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,680
as far as I can tell,
and of course this is a broad 

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:22,960
generalization and one that will 
undoubtedly get me in trouble,

81
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,630
we would never get in trouble.

82
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,500
No,
no.

83
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,330
I know women are,
I think more concerned with intimacy and

84
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,320
relationship.
And that's an interesting dichotomy that

85
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,110
you established between those two.
And so what,

86
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:43,111
why you said that intimacy detracts from
perfection because it's sort of,

87
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,651
it spreads you out in the world.
Why did you come across that particular 

88
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:53,821
paradox?
Why do you think that one fascinates 

89
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:53,821
you?

90
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,160
Well,
I'm,

91
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm hyper

92
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,990
and one of the things that I noticed is,
and I think that's the thing,

93
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:05,991
when you find a character who you need 
to live with more than you do with your 

94
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,931
family,
you have to find something at the heart 

95
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:08,931
of them that's uniquely compelling.
And for me,

96
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:09,810
I think I have.

97
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,930
I have a strong perfectionist drive and 
as I've got when I was younger,

98
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,550
it served me well,
right?

99
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:20,551
A lot of the traits that we have or 
negative traits that might be survival 

100
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,430
instincts that got us through a key 
period of our life,

101
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,240
um,
they're easy to discard when they're not

102
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,290
helpful.
Right?

103
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,180
So like,
if you can have a bit of a temper,

104
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:34,181
it's easy to get rid of it.
The ones that are really hard or 

105
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:34,181
adaptive,
you know,

106
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,480
qualities that we have that have gotten 
us very,

107
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:37,700
very far.
But now we're starting to interfere with

108
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:42,701
our lives.
And so one of the things that I noticed 

109
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,490
is that my drive for severe discipline 
and perfection,

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,920
uh,
is tough when you're married,

111
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,560
when you have a wife,
when you have two kids,

112
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:51,650
when you have a dog,
if you're singularly focused,

113
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,070
but it's also not something that the 
answer is to just give up completely,

114
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,820
you know.

115
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,820
So it's trying to find a of maintaining 
the value and the drive and the 

116
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,711
discipline that's necessary to be a 
novelist and a screenwriter and comp 

117
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,100
writer and,
and also the exhibit discipline in other

118
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:12,101
areas of my life,
while also a lab allowing for sort of 

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,620
the complications that come with 
intimacy.

120
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,680
And so with Evan Smoke,
with my main character,

121
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,681
for me,
the whole series coalesce around a 

122
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,200
certain exchange that he has,
which is,

123
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,510
you know,
one of the things that I did when I 

124
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,510
first was thinking about him being 
pulled out,

125
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,731
he's this broke foster kid,
pulled out of the projects in East 

126
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:34,250
Baltimore at the age of 12 and he's 
raised only by handler.

127
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,740
No one even knows who he is and his 
codings or fanatics.

128
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,730
And I thought instead of making this the
usual Sabi backstory,

129
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,110
what if that handler was a really 
fundamentally good man and became like a

130
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,790
father figure and actually loved him.

131
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,210
And at one point Jack Johns,
who's his handler,

132
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,730
tells him the heart when he's a kid.
He says,

133
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,770
the hard part is not going to be making 
you a killer.

134
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,830
The hard part is gonna be keeping you 
human and forever and the thing that 

135
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,050
stuck in my head was it would be so much
easier if he was just purely as an acid,

136
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,110
if his moral compass was never broken,
but because of the way that he was 

137
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,370
raised,
he at a certain point,

138
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:15,371
the ambiguity's of committee,
these assassinations in different 

139
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:18,731
territories where we're not supposed to 
be and he has limited information that 

140
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:22,120
the moral ambiguity is become too much 
and he leaves and become sort of a pro 

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,270
bono assassin for people in desperate 
need.

142
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,330
Like that's where we meet him in the 
series and it's only because Jack had 

143
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,411
gave him a human connection that opened 
up the complexities that make this 

144
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,560
complicated for him.
You know,

145
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,900
when I was writing the punisher is a 
marvel character.

146
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,490
That's not hard.
The punishers families,

147
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,490
all dad,
he just wants to kill everybody.

148
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,680
He wants to punish everybody.
With Evan,

149
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:47,681
there's this thing at the heart of it 
that like he still has to function with 

150
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,370
this humanity that was given to him from
his father figure.

151
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:49,550
Right.

152
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,010
I was thinking that of the Batman movie 
with Heath Ledger,

153
00:07:55,511 --> 00:08:00,511
and one of the things that happens in 
the movie is that the joker accuses 

154
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,680
Batman of being exactly the same as he 
is fundamentally like there you could 

155
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,540
say opposite sides of the same coin or 
maybe even closer than that.

156
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,050
And it seems to me that there's 
something in what you're saying that 

157
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,750
mitigates against the deadly danger,
maybe even what you call it,

158
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:21,751
a psychopathic intensity of single 
mindedness because one question you 

159
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,450
might ask yourself is that if,
if,

160
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,190
if intimacy interferes with perfection,
then why bother with it?

161
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,250
Probably not,
right.

162
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,470
And well,
and also like how do we widen out the 

163
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:34,470
definition of perfection?
It's like,

164
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,531
okay,
so if you take Bruce Wayne to his 

165
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:38,531
logical end and he's,
you know,

166
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,620
killed a lot of bad guys and maintain 
fit physical perfection,

167
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,060
uh,
and dies alone in his manner is that 

168
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,001
actually perfection.
Like you have to broaden our definition 

169
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,360
of what you apply perfection to.
And um,

170
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,420
I didn't

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,980
do as good a job of laying out that 
dichotomy in my earlier question.

172
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,030
I might've,
but one of the things you mentioned was 

173
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,391
that it was his presupposition that men 
were after perfection and women were 

174
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:10,131
after wholeness.
That's a more inclusive than the issue 

175
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,270
with perfection is,
but it's single minded,

176
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,740
right?
And that only focuses on,

177
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,770
let's say one thing,
whereas wholeness seems to be something 

178
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,200
more like the balance between a variety 
of,

179
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,890
of,
uh,

180
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,930
positive and valuable things.
And you can't be perfect at a variety of

181
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,630
useful and balanced are valuable at 
balance things you have to settle for 

182
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,960
maybe b plus at a,
at a variety of them.

183
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:37,830
But the question is,
is the totality ethan more valuable than

184
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:42,831
perfection along one axis?
And I suppose it depends on the 

185
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:42,831
situation,
but,

186
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,870
but obviously that's something that 
you're continually toying with and you 

187
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,730
said it because it reflects a similar 
situation in your own life and with your

188
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:51,420
own character.

189
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,050
So you,

190
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,000
you've managed to integrate intimacy 
into your life.

191
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,890
And so what's been the advantage to 
that?

192
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,400
Well,
the advantage is it's,

193
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I mean,
a lot of the things that give that 

194
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,160
ultimately give I think pleasure and 
meaning to life come from intimacy.

195
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,210
You know,
it's that thing,

196
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,180
it's like there's the old saw that 
people say when people die,

197
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,130
it's rare that they're going to say,
Gosh,

198
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:23,131
I wish I worked more in regardless of 
what the work is versus spending time 

199
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,941
with your family and with your friends.
And it's like I've noticed increasingly 

200
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:30,421
as I get older,
there's a shift in priorities and 

201
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:30,720
values,
but it stills one that's,

202
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,020
it's hard for me at times because I get,
I can get single minded.

203
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,240
I mean I can get hypo manic when I'm 
writing.

204
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:42,241
I write generally 10 hours a day,
but I've written as much as 23 hours 

205
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,000
straight,
you know,

206
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:48,001
when I was on a TV show that was a risk 
of shutting down and we needed a script 

207
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,690
and there's just not a choice for it.

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,720
So I can get incredibly focused.
But the more focused that that I get 

209
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,450
with writing,
one of the things that you're doing with

210
00:10:55,451 --> 00:11:00,451
writing when you're in a venture that's 
difficult is you have a very high error 

211
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,680
recognition,
um,

212
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,610
alarm system,
right?

213
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:08,611
That's cliche.
That's not gonna work that's been seen 

214
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,891
before.
And you want to do something that's new 

215
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:10,891
and if you're in a field that's hard,
that's turned up really high,

216
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:15,510
well that can make living with you 
really difficult or interacting with 

217
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,030
other people.
Very effective for work to say,

218
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:21,031
how do I make everything better?
What's everything that's wrong with 

219
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,971
this?
It's sort of an approach to a 

220
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,381
manuscript,
but it doesn't work as well if you have 

221
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,321
a two year old or a five year old at 
home where you're trying to to to deal 

222
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:28,720
with something else and you can also 
lose perspective.

223
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,760
So there's a,
there's a single mindedness to the range

224
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,510
of perfection that you can lose things 
at the periphery.

225
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,500
So like having some pe pluses and other 
arenas I think are better.

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I mean that's one of the things what 
relationships are good for is literally 

227
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,260
providing perspective.
Like we always say that,

228
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,540
you know,
my friend gave me a good perspective,

229
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,040
but it's like there's somebody literally
outside you looking at you aware of what

230
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,800
your blind spots are aware of the things
you're doing wrong,

231
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:58,801
but we just can't see.
And that's one of the intimacy is 

232
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,700
immensely useful is it's like you can be
on perfection and just tell often,

233
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,701
but wilderness and be gone if you don't 
have other people looking at you and 

234
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:06,880
keeping you human,
you know.

235
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:07,540
And so it's.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,660
Right.
Right.

237
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,690
Well that's actually one of the 
arguments that I've been making up here 

238
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,231
as you know,
for the necessity of freedom of speech 

239
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,171
is that it isn't so much that you get to
say what you think and be right.

240
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,990
It's that you get to say what you think 
and be exposed to the corrective views 

241
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,251
of other people and they have the same 
responsibility and right with regards to

242
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,710
their own speech,
they have to say what they think,

243
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,711
but they have to be open to corrective 
input from other people.

244
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,830
Well,
and,

245
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,290
and it's,
it's impossible.

246
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,370
Like if we want to evolve into a society
where if you misspeak,

247
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,880
like for instance,
there was a Saturday night live writer 

248
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,770
who made it a tweet that was denigrating
Barron trump,

249
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,830
right?
And she ultimately regretted it,

250
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,330
right?
And so she apologized.

251
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,690
Doesn't matter,
sign out,

252
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,910
live kind of a suspended,
are either suspended her or let her go,

253
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,930
suspended her indefinitely and so 
there's this interesting question of 

254
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,430
like if you're a comedian and your job 
is to be funny,

255
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:16,431
being funny revolves on being a reverend
and on being surprised and you're the 

256
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:20,601
court jester in a certain way.
You have to go too far sometimes in 

257
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,550
order to do your job properly and maybe 
that's three times out of 10.

258
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,540
So she said something that she believed 
that she went too far and she apologized

259
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:32,541
for us and we've gotten into this place 
that people don't accept apologies 

260
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:32,541
anymore

261
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,340
worse.
Actually,

262
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:37,780
I think it looks to me like we've got to
a place where if you,

263
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,050
if you make an apology,
people regard that as a final proof of 

264
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:43,870
your guilt.

265
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,890
Right?
Which it.

266
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,360
Yeah.
And then it encourages a lack of insight

267
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,090
and apology from people who are 
increasingly rise in power.

268
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,090
But the thing for me that so interesting
is it's like when I write,

269
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:57,390
I give myself permission to write a 
vomit draft of a book.

270
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,910
I talked to so many aspiring writers who
say,

271
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,120
I sit down and I just walk up,
I write a paragraph and then I don't 

272
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,031
know what to do.
I've conversation after conversation 

273
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,131
with people and I say,
don't be afraid to make mistakes and 

274
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:10,140
fail.
You cannot fix a blank page.

275
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,350
Get something down.
I call it the vomit draft and then you 

276
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,271
can fix it.
And if we're losing that ability in 

277
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:23,391
speech like everyone has to speak like 
Winston Churchill upon first pass 

278
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:26,970
everyone else a perfectly constructed 
sentences perfectly regarding thought.

279
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,240
We're going to lose our ability to 
interact in ways that are meaningful to 

280
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
stop and pause and say,
you're right that,

281
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,700
that did go too far.
Let me back off.

282
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,360
Yeah.
Students,

283
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,420
my graduate students and my 
undergraduates as well to write a really

284
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,640
bad first draft.
And I also tell them,

285
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,030
you can't play around with that.
Like you can't pretend that you're going

286
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,270
to write a really bad first draft and 
then uh,

287
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,340
and then you know,
break the rules of that game and rights 

288
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,150
and tried to write something good 
anyways because that doesn't work.

289
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:04,151
It doesn't free you up and you know,
I tell them that at the same time if 

290
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:08,621
they're trying to write a 2000 word 
essay to write a really bad 3000 word 

291
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:12,521
essay or 4,000
word essay so that they can feel 

292
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:14,130
comfortable throwing away 50 percent of 
it and

293
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,430
amazing how you get to good through 
that.

294
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,630
Like a lot of times I sit down,
uh,

295
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:23,040
you know,
and if you're not feeling it,

296
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,140
and if I just start writing at a certain
point,

297
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,090
it's sort of like if you set.
I always tell young,

298
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,430
younger writers set time that you make 
sap percent.

299
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,870
You know that as above all else that you
have to.

300
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,730
Right?
So even if it's an hour twice a week,

301
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,760
at a certain point,
you're going to hit the hour mark and 

302
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,100
realize that you're at an hour and a 
half years at an hour and 45 minutes.

303
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:46,101
It leads to more.
And so if you're willing to write into 

304
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,240
mistakes and errors and not be overly 
concerned with,

305
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,480
you know,
if everything is an impeccable he 

306
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,960
detailed,
you will get to stuff that's better.

307
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,100
At a certain point you'll start doing 
real writing.

308
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:59,310
The language will start to actually be 
alive as opposed to dad.

309
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:00,930
It's a way to,
to access it.

310
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:05,931
It's like a warm up jogging,
a warm up clamp on a track before you 

311
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,290
sprint and we need to be able to have 
that,

312
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
you know,
and it's,

313
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,490
you have to push yourself out to the 
place where you're actually making 

314
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,581
errors.
You were talking about comedians and it 

315
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,030
seems to me that that's,
if you're exploring a set of new ideas,

316
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,370
instead of just writing down what you 
already know,

317
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,000
which would sort of be like imitating 
yourself or parodying yourself,

318
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,120
you have to push yourself past what you 
already know.

319
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,420
And if you're not doing that,
if you're doing that,

320
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:33,820
you're going to make mistakes.
And if you're not doing that,

321
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:38,821
then you're not going to be doing 
something that's creative and 

322
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:38,821
interesting.
And so there is some kind of,

323
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,130
excuse me,
but there is some kind of optimal ratio 

324
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,061
of error to creative thought.
I remember that there was a good study 

325
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,980
done about relationships,
um,

326
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,890
and their longevity.
And one question might be,

327
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,240
how many positive interactions compared 
to negative interactions do you have to 

328
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,101
have an order for a relationship to 
maintain itself stably across time and 

329
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:07,830
you'd think,
well,

330
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,100
the higher the positive to the negative,
the better.

331
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,460
But that isn't how it turned out.
It turned out that five positive to one 

332
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,530
negative interactions,
roughly speaking was the lower bound.

333
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,780
If it got,
if the negative,

334
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,840
if the ratio God lower than that,
then people got unhappy in the 

335
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,531
relationship degenerated,
but if it got above 11 positive 

336
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:33,600
interactions to one negative 
interaction,

337
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:38,601
it also became unstable.
And I think the reason for that is that 

338
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:42,790
there is no corrective information.
Yeah,

339
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:51,041
that's a tough one for people to grasp 
because they often don't get to 

340
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:51,230
contentment,
but is it content that exactly?

341
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Or is it spaces or.
Or it's also there's something horrific 

342
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,030
about only seeing the positive reflected
back to you.

343
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,500
It's

344
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,430
take things for granted.
I always,

345
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,690
I always say about blocks.
It's like when I'm writing any project,

346
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:10,200
if there's not a certain point that I'm 
scared that I can't pull it off.

347
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,040
I haven't chosen the right project.
I mean,

348
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,130
and I'm,
I don't know,

349
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,510
18 novels in,
I mean I've written 10 scripts,

350
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,930
I've written 80.
Um,

351
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,800
and part of that is how to change things
up and this whole notion that we're 

352
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:24,860
talking about with,
with this character,

353
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,440
with them and smoke started with that.
I was like,

354
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:31,490
I was thinking about writing this ultra 
bad ass assassin character.

355
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,590
It's a thriller or deals with other 
themes,

356
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,680
some of which we can get into.
But part of what I thought about was,

357
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,180
you know,
we never see.

358
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:43,181
We never see James Bond go home.
We never see Jason Bourne and a bad ass 

359
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:48,101
mission.
He's bleeding in his arm and he gets in 

360
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,831
an elevator with a single mom who is an 
elderly woman who's a neighbor in the 

361
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,710
nagging him to go to his homeowner's 
association meeting because you haven't 

362
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,710
done it yet.

363
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,640
So it's like,
if I can create a character who 

364
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,561
represent these archetypical ideals,
but crossing in the world with me and 

365
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:03,740
you,
no one's done that.

366
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,930
And the whole time I was writing that,
I was thinking,

367
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,890
is this going to just fail miserably?
Is this not going to interest people and

368
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,840
my birth because we're using,
you know,

369
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:16,010
anyone who's writing genre,
we're using a previous mole,

370
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,040
which I don't,
I don't mean in a way that's 

371
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,040
denigrating.
I mean,

372
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,040
that's what,
that's what Shakespeare,

373
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Dan,
you know,

374
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,751
some of the,
the destructuring containment and 

375
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:26,930
traditions of reform form can be 
enormously useful.

376
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,660
But I'm always trying to tap it and 
break it at the edges.

377
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,510
I did that a lot when I was writing 
Batman.

378
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,930
So.
So let's talk about the comics and bit.

379
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,430
You wrote Batman for hold on

380
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,390
two,
two years.

381
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,770
I started writing six months of the pain
boy,

382
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,720
um,
and I had this really funny thing.

383
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,940
I was writing for marvel or Wolverine 
and punish her or her,

384
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:51,941
two of my favorite characters and dc 
came along and told me I could do sort 

385
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,720
of whatever I wanted and you know,
pick a character.

386
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,110
And I said,
what I really want to do is write a 

387
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,291
graphic novel of the pain Goin.
And he sort of looked at me with alarm 

388
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,240
because of all the choices that I had.
That was totally bizarre.

389
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,380
But one of my big inspirations and 
comics is the killing Joe by Alan more.

390
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:12,380
That's the the essential origin story of
the joker.

391
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,450
And I thought the pain one had always 
been kind of a joke.

392
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,370
And furthermore I thought how 
interesting,

393
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:21,371
because if you're the penguin then 
Batman is the enemy at that man is a 

394
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,310
bully.
Right?

395
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,370
And so I wanted to do this alternate 
thing and so he was like,

396
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,100
you know,
the Polisher dc let me do it.

397
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,250
But I still remember there was an online
poll that said that they listed 10 

398
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,810
upcoming comics,
mind among it and asked how much readers

399
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:37,160
work.
We're anticipating them.

400
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,230
And I got point,
oh,

401
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,480
three percent of the vote.
And I still remember one of my favorite 

402
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,050
denigrating comments of all time is one 
guy just wrote,

403
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm so glad her,
his mom voted for him,

404
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,820
which was great.
And so he came out to like the interest 

405
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,670
of no one.
But what happened is,

406
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,730
is that the critics really spoke to us 
and then readers really sparked to it 

407
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,260
and people all of a sudden said,
we've never looked at the pain when this

408
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:07,261
way.
And it was this very interesting object 

409
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:07,261
lesson that like,
had I gone for the obvious and said,

410
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,780
let me write Batman right away,
or let me write superman right away.

411
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,210
I chose something that was super bizarre
that I had to write.

412
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,240
And then I knew that I really wanted to 
write and could do well and from the 

413
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,800
most unlikely position it led to me 
having,

414
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,260
it sort of led to a whole other phase in
my career,

415
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,520
you know?
And then I found myself,

416
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,550
you know,
all of a sudden I'm working on Batman 

417
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:29,550
for two years with the best artists in 
the world.

418
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:29,550
But

419
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,140
he took a,
he took a lowly approach and an approach

420
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,780
to something that people actually phoned
contemptible

421
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,250
Yes.

422
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,350
And,
and,

423
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,500
and through that you got what you want.
So what in the world wasn't about the 

424
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,510
penguin and the story that you wrote,
the why in the world.

425
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,120
Did the Penguin grip you like that?
Do you have any idea,

426
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,360
and tell us again,
tell us what you made of it as well.

427
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:51,990
Well,
I,

428
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,930
I had a strong affinity,
like I said,

429
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:59,931
for the killing joke and I always 
thought the pain one was so interesting 

430
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:03,201
because of all of Batman's rivals.
He's the only one who's saying that 

431
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,640
right of the hole,
you know,

432
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,730
of all of the nemeses.
And the other thing that just really 

433
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,881
struck me was this whole way to view 
Batman through completely different 

434
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:20,121
prism.
I mean like you can look at the joker 

435
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:20,121
who's insane and then you look at 
Batman,

436
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,080
but,
but that means semi insane too,

437
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,870
like there's craziness and it's such an 
interesting prism.

438
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:28,250
So with the pain one I wrote about his 
upbringing and you know,

439
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,010
he's this unappealing overweight kid.
His brothers were,

440
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,840
you know,
athletic and robust.

441
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:35,790
He was always bullied growing up.
And it's like,

442
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,791
well guess what Batman is.
That means like this paragon of a 

443
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:40,791
physical specimen.

444
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,090
So he's always appearing in the 
background.

445
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,240
But I was like,
if I can get people to empathize with 

446
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,900
the penguin and view Batman is a villain
or not as a villain necessarily,

447
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:53,901
but just to really,
if we can really relate to the penguin 

448
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:54,330
and what his position is in that 
universe.

449
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,350
Um,
I just thought that would be cool.

450
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,470
But also a lot of it was.
And Alyssa lot what happens is like,

451
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:03,700
I don't have a conscious thought about 
it.

452
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,170
I was literally driving to the meeting 
with the publisher dc and I just was 

453
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,230
thinking,
I know the story,

454
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,440
I know how to write it.
I know how I want to sort of directed on

455
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:16,160
the page.
I know what I want to say with that.

456
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,890
And it's only in hindsight I can look 
back and untangle it and realize that,

457
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,000
you know,
oh,

458
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,430
well,
part of what I was interested in were,

459
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:24,960
were,
was the aspect that it's,

460
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,240
that he's actually saying and there's a 
bullying way.

461
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,910
And it's a way to look at that man 
through a new.

462
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:29,760
Yeah.
Well,

463
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:34,761
there's a,
there's an interesting idea lurking in 

464
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:34,761
there as well,
which is,

465
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,720
if you think of Batman as an,
as an ideal,

466
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,540
now he's kind of a one dimensional 
ideal.

467
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,320
An ideal is also a judge because it's 
something that you can't attain exactly 

468
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,510
or,
or that if you look at it,

469
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,330
um,
makes you acutely aware of your,

470
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,720
of your lack,
and so on the one hand that ideal is 

471
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,910
something that is positive and we're 
striving for,

472
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:02,630
but on the other hand it's necessarily 
something that's got this.

473
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,930
It's not exactly a bullying element,
but it's something similar to that 

474
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,900
because you're insufficient in its 
presence,

475
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,050
might say as well,
to the degree that the ideal is one 

476
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,660
dimensional.
The fact that you're insufficient in its

477
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:22,661
presence is actually a bit.
It's a bit unjust or unfair because 

478
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,190
there may be other dimensions of 
comparison along which you're,

479
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,420
you're doing fun.

480
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,320
It's actually a claim that's quite 
similar to the postmodernist idea.

481
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:33,410
You know that if you erect a hierarchy 
of values,

482
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,860
then by necessity you exclude people 
from that hierarchy and that that is in 

483
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:43,880
some sense it's oppressive and it's 
wrong.

484
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,150
Of course they issue,
they don't address is that if there's no

485
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:52,151
hierarchy of values,
there's nowhere to go and there's 

486
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:54,280
nothing to do,
but there is a point there that if 

487
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,461
you're the exemplar of something you 
make everyone else feel insufficient in 

488
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:01,511
your presence and you could also imagine
it would be easy for that to take on a 

489
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:01,670
bullying aspect.

490
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,360
I still focused a lot on the villains 
and their perspective,

491
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,060
so I did it with David Finch on Pearl 
Harbor Event and for the new 52 and then

492
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,150
I did one with the mad hatter with with 
Eaton Vance,

493
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:20,030
skype or some of these amazing artists.
But one of the things that I put

494
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,150
in one of the comics is one of the thugs
who batman comes along and says like,

495
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,610
you don't remember when you do you have 
that meant says no,

496
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:34,670
and you guys,
you came flying through the window and 

497
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:34,670
you know the typical Batman scene and 
kick me with your,

498
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,230
you know,
your,

499
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:39,090
your boots leaned on my jaw.
Here's what that surgery was.

500
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,510
Here's what I'm living with.
And he goes down this very detail 

501
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,340
because so often it's Batman swings 
through window and smashes a bad guy and

502
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:51,780
we all move on and I took these pauses 
sometimes to kind of look at things from

503
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:55,470
a different angle and it was horrific 
and fractured his skull and his,

504
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,500
you know,
his sinus was out and it was this 

505
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:00,680
horrific injury that took,
you know,

506
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,900
15 screws and I sort of detail of the 
whole thing as he throws it back to 

507
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,350
Batman to be like,
you know,

508
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:12,351
I'm,
I'm kind of cannon fodder and your 

509
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:12,351
mission,
maybe what I was doing is wrong.

510
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,120
Here's the level of pain that you've 
inflicted on me nonetheless.

511
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,570
And it was this interesting pause and 
I'd say the things that.

512
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,690
There's always a tightrope act when 
you're writing a comic book character 

513
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,300
because they're sort of in a public 
trust.

514
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,530
You know,
I don't own them.

515
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,590
DC doesn't fully own them though.
They owned them legally.

516
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:31,710
But like the stuff that you know,
that you can't do,

517
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,840
you can't have Batman and kill a bus 
load of nuns.

518
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:38,841
I mean there's the obvious.
But part of what they hire me is it's 

519
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:39,480
like I need to bring something new to 
this character,

520
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,200
but also I need to honor the traditions 
that have come before.

521
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,440
So it's like I've been entrusted with 
this thing where I have to play with it 

522
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
and I have to navigate that tight rope 
very,

523
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:55,401
very meticulously to do something that 
makes it worth them bringing me on to 

524
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:59,611
give readers something new and to make 
myself feel like I've put my own stamp 

525
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,830
on the character but not stray too far.

526
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,230
So it's a real exercise in being this 
sort of,

527
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,330
you know,
holding the flame of this tradition.

528
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,080
One of the ways I did that a lot too,
that,

529
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,210
that did was I would make fun of the 
tradition itself.

530
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,460
I got slightly mete with it,
for instance.

531
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,730
So it gives you.
One example is I did a scene where Jim 

532
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,840
Gordon,
the police commissioner is talking,

533
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,750
you know,
it's late at night.

534
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,620
Batman appears in his office.
They're having a conversation,

535
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:29,621
it's darkly lit.
And Jim starts to muse on something and 

536
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:29,621
he walks,
you know.

537
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:33,070
So the frame is just with him and he's 
looking out the window and he talks for 

538
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,070
two panels.
Then he says,

539
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,730
oh,
this is the part where I turned around 

540
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:37,730
and you're no longer there,
right?

541
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,030
And there's a blank,
and then Batman says,

542
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,120
nope.
And then they turned around and regard 

543
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,120
each other very awkwardly for a panel 
and then they go,

544
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,110
all right then.
And then they will walk away awkwardly.

545
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,500
So it's like it.
It's knowing that we all live in a world

546
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,250
of Batman comics and maybe Batman 
himself even does also.

547
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,330
And some of those little nuances are,
or a way to kind of massage,

548
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,810
massage it into something in,
in a culture that's increasingly pop 

549
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:02,810
cultural where.

550
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,940
So,
so I was thinking about this perfection 

551
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,810
issue again and the issue of 
monstrousness.

552
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,960
So I read this,
I think it was a billion wicked 

553
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,321
thoughts,
which is a very interesting book of the 

554
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:22,220
Google engineers were looking at google 
searches and trying to do psychology as 

555
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,340
a consequence.
And because they're engineers,

556
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,400
they're,
they'll think anything they want to 

557
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,400
think and they don't care much about how
politically correct it is.

558
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,200
For example.
And one of the things they noted was 

559
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,201
that they were looking at pornography 
use and it's no surprise to anyone,

560
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:42,850
of course the men use images for 
pornography fundamentally,

561
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,400
and everyone knows what the images are 
like.

562
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:45,910
It's,
it's,

563
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,130
it's usually young women who are 
symmetrical and so forth and,

564
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,570
and youthful from associate biological 
perspective because that's associated 

565
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,400
with a fruitfulness and fecundity and 
that sort of thing.

566
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:57,820
And,
and,

567
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,170
and

568
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,250
that's actually my favorite website is 
young women who were symmetrical not 

569
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,810
call the advertisement has to be 
slightly different,

570
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,670
but nonetheless point is taken.
Yes,

571
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:08,410
exactly,
exactly.

572
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,220
They also looked at female pornography 
use and that surprisingly enough,

573
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:19,221
and it was almost all literary it was 
written and it was stories and they 

574
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,650
pointed out.
But the basic story,

575
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:27,651
and this is something that I found 
extremely useful because in some ways 

576
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:30,681
I'm,
I've always been looking for the 

577
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:30,681
fundamental female myth,
um,

578
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,960
because it's not exactly the same as the
hero archetype,

579
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,000
which is perhaps the fundamental male 
myth.

580
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:42,001
But anyways,
the female myth was essentially beauty 

581
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:45,040
and the.
So the guy was basically obviously,

582
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,630
and she would,
she would entice him into a relationship

583
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,660
that would tame him in some sense and he
would become humanized but under her 

584
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,600
tutelage and devote himself to her and 
they named the five most common beasts 

585
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,970
in this kind of literature be soft 
corporate Augie or maybe even hardcore 

586
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,630
pornographic literature.
I know that even a Harlequin,

587
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,640
the big purveyor of romance novels has a
pretty hardcore side imprint.

588
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,110
Anyways.
The five most popular beasts were 

589
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,570
surgeon,
billionaire,

590
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,510
pirate vampire,
and we're wolf,

591
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,920
which is,
you know,

592
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,110
really quite comical as far as I'm 
concerned.

593
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:36,220
But it made me think,
well you were talking about perfection,

594
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:39,490
that there is a kind of monstrousness 
imperfection as well.

595
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,120
And so,
you know,

596
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,750
again,
women,

597
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,130
they,
the research evidence seems to suggest 

598
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,661
that women made across and up dominance 
hierarchies where men mate across and 

599
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,820
down socio economic dominance 
hierarchies.

600
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:59,821
And so the women are in some sense 
attracted to guys who are unit 

601
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:03,831
dimensionally monstrous enough to climb 
to the top of a given dominance 

602
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:04,570
hierarchy.
But then,

603
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,420
and so that begs the question,
which is that in that drive for 

604
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,401
perfection,
if there isn't something intrinsically 

605
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,981
monstrous and that has something to do 
with the willingness to sacrifice 

606
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:18,880
everything else to that single minded 
pursuit.

607
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:24,810
So I wonder if those things are even if 
you can even take them apart because 

608
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:28,510
Batman who's obviously a creature of the
night,

609
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,740
I,
I would say he's probably the superhero 

610
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,950
that has the most self evident 
integration of pathology associated with

611
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:40,951
his character,
something like that because he's this 

612
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,111
dark guy and he definitely operates 
outside of the parameters of the law 

613
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,491
quite clearly and is motivated to know 
small and by vengeance I would say like 

614
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,970
the end,
the borderline between vengeance and 

615
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,871
justice is of course very murky.
So then you talked about the,

616
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,400
the,
the requirement or the utility of 

617
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,910
intimacy in buffering against that 
perfection.

618
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:11,911
But that makes you wonder too if it also
provides a necessary buffer against 

619
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:11,911
monster business.

620
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,270
Well that's to the hard part than 
turning into a killer and the hard part 

621
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,310
of keeping you human

622
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,040
and that that's the law that he deals 
with.

623
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,830
But I can say,
you know,

624
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,580
with,
with orphan x,

625
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,530
I mean this is a book that connected 
with readers.

626
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,290
It's been translated and published in 20
languages.

627
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,560
The vast majority of emails that I get 
or about his relationship trying to 

628
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,490
navigate way through the normal world.

629
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,830
That's the stuff that people love with 
it.

630
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,010
So there's the mission,
there's the spy stuff.

631
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I'd say there's two parts.
One of them is that he is a trained 

632
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,930
assassin who now is become a pro.
Bono was asset.

633
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,050
His moral compass was never broken 
because of his upbringing with Jack.

634
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:02,290
He now helps only the truly desperate 
orals to turn evil capitalist.

635
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,980
Exactly.
Well he has.

636
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,250
He has money stash and bank accounts 
everywhere for when he was operating off

637
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,070
the books.
So there,

638
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:16,071
there's a,
there's a good capitalist string still 

639
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,491
going on.
But the other thing is these 

640
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:18,491
interactions,
like you know,

641
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:22,030
there's a single mother who's been 
widowed with a young boy who lives 

642
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,040
downstairs from him,
who he is,

643
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,590
who he is in amherst have but has no 
idea.

644
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,660
He doesn't speak the language of 
intimacy.

645
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,120
So there's this like distant flirtatious
relationship with her.

646
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,160
The boys very enamored of Evan,
he doesn't quite know what to do with 

647
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,490
her to complicate matters further.
She's a district attorney,

648
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,520
so she actually knew anything about him 
that's legitimate and she'd have to 

649
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,341
prosecute him and those,
those moments of him trying to figure 

650
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:45,560
out,
I'm,

651
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,620
I'm carrying out this mission that 
requires comprehensive discipline and 

652
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:55,871
focus and yet here's this draw to this 
woman and her kid and they'll kind of 

653
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,180
warmth of a house that's,
that's an immense draw for him and I 

654
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,511
think at the heart of him,
there's this conflict where like I 

655
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:04,511
always,
I view it.

656
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:06,230
Then he's kind of got his face up to the
glass and he's looking at it.

657
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:09,740
All of these people leading ordinary 
lives that he himself could never leave.

658
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,220
Like he can never live those lives.
But so what he can do is to protect 

659
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,241
people when those ordinary lives are 
disrupted and when they're put upon by 

660
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,480
horrible men.

661
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,680
Right?
Are horrible.

662
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,470
Unfixable solutions.
The cops can't help you.

663
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,450
Nobody can help you and you're 
powerless.

664
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,370
You've been bullied nearly into oblivion
and there's a huge risk to yourself.

665
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,400
They can call him and he can fix it so 
we can constantly reestablished and 

666
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,941
protect the lives of other people,
but he can't ever have that and so that 

667
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:42,650
for me is what's really interesting and 
that takes a twist in the knower man,

668
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:47,651
as we discussed,
which deals more with kind of different 

669
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,680
thematics since he's the one who's 
captured about aging versus you know,

670
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,160
about trying to be everything versus 
trying to be one thing.

671
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Yeah.
You played that out differently in the 

672
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,250
nowhere man was different.
Yeah.

673
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,610
That's it.
That's a slightly different theme,

674
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,270
right?
That's,

675
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,420
there's a peter pan theme there.
Yeah,

676
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,640
go ahead.
No,

677
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,210
no,
go ahead.

678
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,770
Well,
so I mean,

679
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,090
so again,
in the nowhere,

680
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,800
man,
I mean for the second book,

681
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,640
it's always tricky to follow up a book 
that,

682
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,260
that,
that,

683
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,680
that connects with the readership in a 
certain way,

684
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:19,040
but I really wanted to turn reader 
expectations on their head.

685
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:19,940
So I thought,
well,

686
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:24,941
what if instead of of avid going and 
doing another mission that we're used 

687
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:30,191
to,
he gets the anonymous phone call and 

688
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:31,861
goes and help someone.
What if he finds himself in exactly the 

689
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:33,410
kind of predicament that other people 
usually call him before,

690
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,740
so the no,
Amanda opens with him and finishing out 

691
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,090
the end of an operation somehow manages 
to get kidnapped,

692
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:44,091
as I mentioned.
He comes to in this distant chateau 

693
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,601
where he's being overseen by a guy 
called Renee Peter casserole and we're 

694
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,830
not quite sure why he's there.
They don't know who he is.

695
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,140
Yes,
things are going to get really bad.

696
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:57,141
There's dozens of armed guards,
but ever now is the one who he would 

697
00:35:57,141 --> 00:36:01,161
normally call and has to free himself,
so it's about his own liberation to get 

698
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,421
back to finishing the mission that he 
wants to do and to protect other people 

699
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:05,421
were at the chateau.

700
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:08,790
But what was interesting to me is that 
conversation that we seem to always have

701
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,090
in in thrillers and mysteries and 
comments.

702
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,900
You're just like me,
I'm.

703
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,420
Renee has a similar thing to have and it
says like me,

704
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:21,680
you don't have any rules.
He knows he's a vigilante,

705
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,700
doesn't quite know what he does,
but he thinks he's might be a drug 

706
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:26,730
dealer or you know,
an arms dealer.

707
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,870
He's,
he's ambiguous,

708
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:32,871
he's really just after a particular bank
account that evidence attached to it 

709
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:34,140
hasn't yet learned to realize and Evelyn
says,

710
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:36,240
no,
you want to be everything.

711
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,550
I want to be one thing.
Well,

712
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,770
and it occurred to me when I was doing 
that.

713
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:41,970
So Peter,
Renee,

714
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,020
I'm sorry.
Renee.

715
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:48,021
Peter Cassar.
Roy casserole is a play on the French 

716
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:48,780
word for Pan,
so it's sort of read a Peter Pan.

717
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:49,680
He's,
he's,

718
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,910
he's obsessed with luxury,
with being all things with,

719
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,780
with not making choices,
with turning back the clock on aging.

720
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:00,330
He takes a regimen of pills he's 
obsessed with,

721
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,600
with the aging process.
And it occurred to me again after I 

722
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,841
wrote it,
because I don't go in charting these 

723
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,581
things out like an engineer.
I go in writing a story that I want to 

724
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:14,451
write,
but it occurred to me that Evan 

725
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:14,451
statement to say were as different as 
can be.

726
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:15,690
You want to be everything.
I want to be one thing.

727
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:20,691
Well that being one thing,
well is our only antidote really to 

728
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:23,820
aging.
So it's the exact opposite of what renee

729
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,930
is trying to do.
Who's

730
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,400
the antidote to remaining that?
That it's the antidote to to becoming an

731
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:35,420
old child to which is of course it 
depends story,

732
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:40,421
right?
There's this idea that you have to give 

733
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:42,170
up everything to become one thing and 
it,

734
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,200
but if you don't give it up,
then you become no thing eventually 

735
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,370
because aging drives.
Maybe that's also why your character 

736
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:51,370
casserole,
right?

737
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,840
Has to find off aging because aging is 
forcing him to become well at,

738
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,360
if not to become one thing,
at least to lose his capacity to become 

739
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,730
anything or everything.

740
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,200
Exactly,
and that's the only thing that,

741
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,210
that that's your board.
I mean that's the other argument to 

742
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:10,210
perfection versus intimacy.
At some person,

743
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,920
at some point,
the toll of aging takes perfection away 

744
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,150
from us in every way.
If you're a sharp shooter,

745
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:22,151
if you're an athlete,
if you're young Paul Newman and look 

746
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:25,401
like young Paul Newman,
who is probably the best working human 

747
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,300
humanum,
either gender in history at some point,

748
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:28,160
no matter what,
you are a perfect app,

749
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,400
you're a great surgeon.
Perfection will be taken from you.

750
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,310
So well,
what's the antidote to that?

751
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:37,600
They ended up to that doing something,
doing something else.

752
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:40,180
Well at making choices.
Are you a good husband?

753
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:42,910
Are you a good father?
Do you have a good.

754
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Yeah.
Well that community around you and your 

755
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:48,420
friendships around you so that when an 
agent comes and starts to kick out those

756
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,921
stilts,
you have enough under you that you're 

757
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:52,921
just topple over.

758
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:52,921
Yeah.
Right.

759
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,660
Well,
so that's interesting because the.

760
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,110
You talked about the necessity for,
for uh,

761
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,850
for perfection as an antidote say to the
Peter Pan Problem,

762
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:07,851
but what the case you're making now is 
more of that even perfection as an 

763
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,770
antidote to the Peter Pan Syndrome has 
its problems,

764
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:18,771
but maybe those aren't echoed with 
intimacy and you know,

765
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,870
because you talked about getting older 
and the fact that your family and 

766
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,291
friends become more important to you,
which is definitely something that I've 

767
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:27,291
noticed.

768
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,260
Um,
and

769
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,670
I guess on your death bed,
let's say,

770
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,210
okay,

771
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,270
one of the things that's going to matter
is who's around there with you?

772
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,800
Right?

773
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,480
And I.
and as you get older and you get robbed 

774
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,241
if things.
I wonder if it's the intimate 

775
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:50,211
relationships that you have to provide 
solace with regards to that.

776
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:55,431
I mean,
one of the things that distresses me 

777
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,940
about the way that our world,
the modern Western world is unfolding is

778
00:39:56,941 --> 00:40:01,941
that we act as if we're never going to 
be any older than 35 young talked about.

779
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,550
Carl Jung talked about that he thought 
it was a flaw in our founding myth 

780
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,140
because if you think about Western 
culture is predicated on Christianity.

781
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,570
Of course Christ died when he was about 
32.

782
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,600
That's the.
That's the theory and so there's not 

783
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,420
necessarily any model there for moving 
into the latter house of life and there 

784
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:26,001
is this obsession in western culture 
with youthfulness and with the 

785
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:29,520
possibilities of youth and people.
People Act,

786
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,770
I would say is if they're never going to
get old,

787
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:36,771
and so they.
One of the dangers there is that you 

788
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:38,820
don't establish the kind of 
relationships that are going to buttress

789
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,830
you in your old age.
You ended up finding a sample in your 

790
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,150
forties or whatever and it starts to get
pretty ugly.

791
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,930
It loans

792
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,300
in La because La is the land of the 
perpetual adolescence,

793
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,080
right?
Everyone comes out here off their 

794
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,741
proverbial bus from Des Moines or 
northern Alberta and they want to make 

795
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:05,401
it.
They're the best looking person from 

796
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:06,370
their hometown and who started their 
hometown play and you know,

797
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:08,830
it's squeezing the universe through a 
funnel for people.

798
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,130
We're actually going to be a movie star,
actually going to make it as a singer,

799
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,030
but it's sorta this intermittent 
reinforcement thing that happens is it's

800
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:21,031
like they'll go two or three years 
working on jobs because they need to 

801
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:23,590
keep their schedule open for auditions 
and then they'll get cast as an extra in

802
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:26,860
one thing and then they go three or four
more years because,

803
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:31,861
you know,
because at any point you could hit the 

804
00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:31,861
lottery and everyone has the story of 
the,

805
00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:32,150
you know,
the guy who was a,

806
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,150
you know,
know our,

807
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,470
our culture is also built around never 
give up,

808
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:36,800
right.

809
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,680
You know,
follow your dreams.

810
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,310
And there's,
there's,

811
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,320
there's,
there's a pervasive notion that you 

812
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,500
never settle.
Um,

813
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,350
and,
and I'm not denigrating those things.

814
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm saying that that's part of our 
culture is built,

815
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:53,570
but you see a ton of people here in 
their forties,

816
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:58,571
fifties who never sort of moved onto a 
job or a scaled.

817
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:04,541
It's gratifying there.
Their whole life has been spent waiting 

818
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:05,840
for another break and it's heartbreaking
because,

819
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:07,490
you know,
they had where they had some success for

820
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,190
a period of never recaptured it and 
didn't reinvent themselves.

821
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I noticed something really interesting 
when I went to Australia for book tour 

822
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,400
and I'm going back there,
uh,

823
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,810
and a couple of weeks,
which was amazing,

824
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:22,811
which is I did a lot of events with 
really famous Australians who didn't 

825
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:27,881
cross over to the US.
So like you have your ACDC that came 

826
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:27,881
over here and just blew out bird,
you know,

827
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,410
Nicole mean fill in the blank.

828
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,140
But there was people who were like big 
movie stars who didn't make it here.

829
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,970
I'm a big,
like an enormous rock band there that 

830
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,810
just didn't make it to the US.
And the one thing that I was amazed with

831
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:46,811
is for some reason I came into contact 
with them either for festivals or you 

832
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:50,831
know,
we we had reading together is they all 

833
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:53,141
had meaningful second slash third acts.
So this guy who was a big huge movie 

834
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:59,510
star there was now a big crime fiction 
reviewer,

835
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,660
so I met him because you just don't make
the sort of money and fame here and have

836
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:09,830
the kind of blown out at exposure that 
you linger in and capture catch.

837
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:14,831
After the guy who was a songwriter for 
one of the biggest rock bands in all of 

838
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,730
us wrote it,
wrote this amazing memoir,

839
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,800
was like incredible and was working on 
that.

840
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,100
And it's sorta like if you don't achieve
a sort of astronomical level of 

841
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
exposure,
fame and money,

842
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,400
you still have to make a living.
And making a living is a really good 

843
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,410
motivation to,
to continue to search for and find 

844
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:34,410
meaning.

845
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:34,410
Great.
Yeah.

846
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:34,460
Well that's why.
Yeah,

847
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,490
that's one of the problems with having 
wealth I think with regards to children 

848
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,560
is that if you're wealthy you're 
children can be deprived of necessity.

849
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,910
Right.
And they and also usually by the time 

850
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,610
one his attained wealth.
You've sort of baked in the discipline 

851
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,110
of your end,
the love for your field that led to us.

852
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,440
I mean I guess we can exclude people 
that do a job that they hate forever,

853
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:04,820
but usually people who really make a lot
of money sort of love what they're doing

854
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,821
at some level I find.
And by the time you get to a point,

855
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:14,861
do you know what her after work,
you love the work so much and you start 

856
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,681
to realize that the money once people 
stopped chasing you for bills is what 

857
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:22,570
brings you the happiness.
Because you couldn't take all the 

858
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,290
shortcuts when you were younger.
Like trust fund kids can.

859
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,150
Yeah.
Well the,

860
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,850
the empirical evidence on that is pretty
clear.

861
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Just give me one sec here.
There is a relationship between material

862
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,360
wellbeing and happiness,
roughly speaking or let's say wealth and

863
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:50,361
happiness up to the point where you're 
basically in the lower middle class I 

864
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:56,181
would say.
And that's basically the point where 

865
00:44:56,181 --> 00:44:56,181
bill collectors stopped chasing you 
around.

866
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,700
There's definitely pain in privation,
but there isn't a tremendous amount of 

867
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,000
advantage by,
by,

868
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,180
by the evidence in moving far up the 
economic ladder beyond that,

869
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:12,860
and I think it's because money solves a 
certain set of,

870
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:17,861
yeah problems,
but the ones that doesn't solve it 

871
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:19,861
doesn't solve it all right?
She doesn't solve love that it doesn't 

872
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:23,731
solve.
Ensuring that your children are doing 

873
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:23,731
well.
It doesn't solve health.

874
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:26,380
Um,
in any final sense that the problem with

875
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:31,381
the oral health,
I was also thinking with regards to 

876
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:35,551
perfection and intimacy,
there's another kind of opposition 

877
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:39,931
between them,
which is that if you're after 

878
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,190
perfection,
you can't have intimacy because you have

879
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:47,191
to.
You mentioned that we have this idea 

880
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:49,891
that you shouldn't settle and people 
often say that in relationship to their 

881
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:54,661
relationships,
but they forget that the person that 

882
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,050
you're having a relationship with has 
settled for you.

883
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,230
And,
and

884
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,870
that means that they've settled for 
imperfection in every sense of the word.

885
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,370
And you,

886
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,710
if you're after perfection in your 
relationship,

887
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:11,620
then first of all,
you have impossible standards.

888
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,630
Second year,
impossible to live with.

889
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,960
And third,
if you meet someone that triggers that 

890
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,050
ideal,
then you're going to feel so inferior in

891
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:22,630
relationship to them that you're going 
to make a fool of yourself.

892
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,140
Now it's the classical animal,
randomness possession from the union 

893
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,140
perspective,
you know,

894
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,011
you find someone who meets your ideal of
perfection and then you're so tongue 

895
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:35,281
tied in their presence that you can't 
help but act like a complete deer in the

896
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:38,020
headlights or something equally 
pathological.

897
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,680
So to get into the scene you have to 
give up that you have to give up that 

898
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,370
demand,
at least for immediate perfection May.

899
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,660
Maybe you could work towards it within 
the confines of the relationship.

900
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,920
But that's a whole different thing.

901
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,870
Well driller perspective,
I mean for me,

902
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:57,770
what was so interesting in building that
with Evan is

903
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,510
it's like he's trained as a lone wolf,
right?

904
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,470
There's an orphan program that kicked 
out orphans,

905
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:05,350
but none of them know who each other is.
They operate alone,

906
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,940
but he's chosen to live in the middle of
this residential tower in the world 

907
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,820
corridor.
Kind of hiding among people.

908
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,960
But so he's constantly among people.
But if he sticks to his normal routine,

909
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,480
which is just training,
he's got like a hidden vault that's like

910
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:23,481
as operations comm center that's hidden 
in the back of his super modern 

911
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:28,050
penthouse.
There's all these sort of fantasy 

912
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,561
elements to it,
which I think I undercut enough to not 

913
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:31,040
turn it into like sort of,
you know,

914
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,340
weapons foreign or spy car.
Like he,

915
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,330
like there's,
there's,

916
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,800
there's an awareness that,
that,

917
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,600
that I,
I roamed it,

918
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:42,601
Debbie,
even as I revel in some of these 

919
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:43,210
archetypes,
but if he just sticks to his routine,

920
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,510
there is no one there to tell him or 
point out his imperfections.

921
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,980
Right?
When he's on a mission,

922
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,020
it doesn't matter.
He's operating Solo.

923
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:53,290
He's kicking ass.
He has the righteousness and the moral,

924
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:58,410
the legitimate moral superiority of 
doing what is the right thing in the 

925
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,060
protection of other people.
That's all fine.

926
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,360
There's no one to literally gaze on 
Hammer.

927
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,550
Even look at him and notice where his 
imperfections are.

928
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:11,551
Notice where his tongue tied.
Notice what skills that there are that 

929
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:12,250
he's lacking.
If his life stays in that narrow lane,

930
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,650
but he doesn't want his life to just be 
in that lane,

931
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:19,651
but every time he widens it out,
there's all these complications where 

932
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:20,650
it's like,
what do you do with an unruly eight year

933
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,840
old who's asking you inappropriate 
questions?

934
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,940
These are things that his training 
wasn't for.

935
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,480
And there's a real interest in that.
And one of the other things I wanted to 

936
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,600
add as you talked about the,
the female or erotica or the or the that

937
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:39,030
women tend to read and the types of 
monsters which I love that the surgeon 

938
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,030
is included.

939
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,430
And um,
and you know,

940
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,490
I'm sure a lot of them can.
We can start combining them.

941
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:45,580
So you get like a werewolf surgeon.
You can really start upping the ante.

942
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:51,210
But I think one of the things that's 
really interesting in terms of what 

943
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,091
constitutes a successful balance to me,
it's not also the full teaming of the 

944
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:59,521
monstrous of perfectionism.
Whether like in this instance we're 

945
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:01,840
talking about that being from the male 
side of it.

946
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:07,470
It's also like I had a question that was
I did an interview yesterday and 

947
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,130
somebody asked me who knows,
who knows me and my wife pretty well,

948
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:13,090
and so does your wife get,
does she get upset when you're like,

949
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:18,091
okay honey,
I'm off to like the Mexican jungles to 

950
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:18,820
go down class for a Whitewater rafts to 
the researcher.

951
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,210
I'm going to go,
you know,

952
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:25,290
like I just was on a range in vegas 
shooting a lot of insane weapon where 

953
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:26,490
you're,
you know,

954
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:26,980
when,
when I'm,

955
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,040
when I'm doing these sort of more 
dangerous elements that are for 

956
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,040
research.

957
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,170
And it was interesting because I hadn't 
been asked that that specifically,

958
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,200
but I was like,
well I would as a writer when I met my 

959
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,800
wife and she liked that,
a new that and one of the primary themes

960
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,050
is if that's something that you liked in
me,

961
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,340
she,
that's the last thing.

962
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:50,341
She wants to erode it me now.
And we also have a relationship where 

963
00:49:50,341 --> 00:49:53,851
like obviously there's things like if 
there are things about me that are 

964
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:54,460
annoying to my perfectionism or need to 
be reined in,

965
00:49:55,270 --> 00:50:00,270
that's a good discussion.
But it also doesn't mean that you want 

966
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:03,091
to hollow out the aspect of the,
of the perfectionist drive or the 

967
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:08,230
aspects that involve sort of dangerous 
with danger,

968
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:13,231
having one foot and monstrosity from 
your spouse or partner in either 

969
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:13,231
direction.
It's like,

970
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:18,121
you know,
my wife and I just genuinely like each 

971
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:18,121
other.
We don't want to erode in each other.

972
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:19,540
Those things that caused the initial 
attraction.

973
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:20,530
And it's interesting.
[inaudible],

974
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:23,590
I think that's something you see a lot 
in marriages.

975
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,900
I don't know if it's particularly in 
America where you get the sort of 

976
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,251
domineering controlling wife and the 
husband is like the little boy getting 

977
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:37,151
away with things and you know,
trying to get things done and there's 

978
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:40,511
this imbalance that happens really 
quickly as they push each other into 

979
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,410
these roles and forget the very things 
that more attractive to begin with.

980
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,450
Yeah.
Well you see that,

981
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,500
you see that operating in the other 
direction.

982
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Although I would say in a different way,
because you can see husbands who punish 

983
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,060
or failed to reward their wives for 
being attractive.

984
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:53,890
Even though,

985
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,790
yeah,
the domineering husband.

986
00:50:55,791 --> 00:51:00,791
Your,
you said something once that stuck with 

987
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,681
me when I think someone was bragging 
about how they never cleaned the house 

988
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:04,080
or something or some such thing.
You said,

989
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,170
well,
if you turn your wife into a maid,

990
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,580
then you'll be married to a maid.

991
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,420
Yes.
Yes.

992
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:09,770
I think it was toilets.
Actually.

993
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,750
I'm not the sort of guy who cleans the 
toilets.

994
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:12,560
I think I said,
yeah,

995
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:15,020
you're the sort of guy who makes your 
wife cleaned the toilets,

996
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,980
right?
Yeah.

997
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:23,050
Well that's the thing is that it's also 
very difficult within a relationship to 

998
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,720
continually reward your partner for the 
traits that make them attractive because

999
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:31,700
that also makes them attractive to other
people and so if you're concerned in any

1000
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:35,600
way about your fading attractiveness or 
if you're jealous or resentful,

1001
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,630
then you may come to punish your partner
for what makes them attractive and of 

1002
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:45,491
course that's.
That's daft because you'll also have 

1003
00:51:45,491 --> 00:51:47,420
contempt for them and for you if,
if you get away with that,

1004
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,950
but it happens a lot.

1005
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,160
Yeah.
Well,

1006
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:52,660
you know,
it goes down to the.

1007
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:57,690
We've had.
We've had this conversation before that 

1008
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:57,690
at the end of the day,
there are any,

1009
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,040
there are no decisions that aren't 
fundamentally moral.

1010
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,560
There's no good decisions when you're 
looking at something of like,

1011
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:05,860
well,
this is 90 percent moral,

1012
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,950
but 10 percent shady,
but I can reap huge financial reward.

1013
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:10,420
It's like,
don't think you'll get away with it.

1014
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,010
And likewise,
you know,

1015
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:13,930
within a marriage,
you know,

1016
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:18,931
if you have a spouse who you're 
denigrating or you're concerned about 

1017
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:22,951
their attractiveness because of your own
insecurity and you haven't put that to 

1018
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:24,190
rest and you're unwilling to look at 
that,

1019
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,000
that will cost you.
You know,

1020
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:31,010
I think about it a lot as pertains to 
writing because I think a lot that the 

1021
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:35,941
qualities for me at least that didn't 
make me a better writer or the same ones

1022
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:39,490
that make me a better man and a better 
human.

1023
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,730
And it's not something that people talk 
a lot about,

1024
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:43,920
but a lot of it is,
you know,

1025
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,700
if you're.
If I'm in a conversation,

1026
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:50,701
it's like,
can I acknowledge what my shortcomings 

1027
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:51,040
are and what my flaws are?
Can I acknowledge and an argument what's

1028
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:56,041
going on?
Can I pay attention to people enough to 

1029
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:58,741
recognize small moments of 
vulnerabilities and to try to honor or 

1030
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,060
respect those?
Those are all the things in writing that

1031
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,260
it make people connect to character.
Those are all the things in writing that

1032
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:08,420
you need to round out a character.
And I remember when I was like,

1033
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:10,540
I started really young and had a lot of 
luck early.

1034
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:12,280
I started my first book.
I was 19.

1035
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:13,900
I sold it out.
I think it was 22,

1036
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:17,080
23 and you know,
there's stuff in there that's awful,

1037
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,900
like no one should ever be accountable 
for anything that they thought when they

1038
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:20,560
were 19.

1039
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:26,070
But you know,
I have a line in there where it's like 

1040
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,070
he was the best of the best,
you know,

1041
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,380
about like an agent and it's like those 
are the people we don't like.

1042
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,300
You just feel like as I get older,
a lot of.

1043
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:35,230
I put the characters are the times where
you say something out of a,

1044
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,640
a more base instinct and then you feel 
like shit about it.

1045
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,280
Like that's something that makes you 
relate to a character.

1046
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,440
Like I did this thing and I said 
something,

1047
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,160
I reacted in anger.
I have a petty jealousy,

1048
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,400
but that I'm aware of it.
I acted badly and I feel I feel badly 

1049
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:52,800
for it.
I wish I could've acted better.

1050
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,130
But do you need to have the,
the,

1051
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,020
you know,
the uh,

1052
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,830
pretty you need to iris pretty wide 
opening to,

1053
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,300
to take that input in if you want to be 
talented artists

1054
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:08,730
because you're trying to capture all of 
those things which means you have to 

1055
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:08,730
look at them in yourself,
not just another people.

1056
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,390
It's something you see in good 
comedians.

1057
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,400
And I was watching Louis C K recently,
like he definitely goes too far quite 

1058
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:20,670
often.
And one of the things about Louis C,

1059
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:25,671
k that's,
and you also see this as Sarah 

1060
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:28,590
Silverman.
I think we're either of them know 

1061
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:33,360
something will come into their hand and 
they'll say it and they know perfectly 

1062
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,560
well that they've gone too far but 
they're not going to not say it.

1063
00:54:35,561 --> 00:54:40,480
And then they have the good graces to be
like self disgusted.

1064
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:44,350
I would say that they actually said it,
you know,

1065
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,160
and Louis said it's a mix of self 
disgust and enterprise.

1066
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:48,970
Yeah,
exactly.

1067
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:54,190
At the same time,
but I need Louis Ck has the good graces 

1068
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,121
to be embarrassed at least 20 percent of
the time for me and for good reason to 

1069
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,980
like the cinema in the airport.
Yeah,

1070
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:01,770
no,
he's.

1071
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,690
Yeah,
but I mean that it's a big part of it is

1072
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:07,420
like if you want to shut down self 
awareness,

1073
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,030
everything shuts down.
So.

1074
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:14,450
And we're talking about with aging,
we're talking about with marriage and 

1075
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,821
relationships,
but I'm also talking about if you 

1076
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:18,420
wanted,
if you actually want to engage in an 

1077
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,421
endeavor that is interesting,
whether that's writing or teaching or 

1078
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:24,891
being a psychologist or being.
I mean fill in the blank for anything 

1079
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:26,520
that you want to engage in,
in a way that's new and unique.

1080
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,610
You better reflect,
you better think on yourself.

1081
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:32,400
You better not armor yourself solely an 
ideology,

1082
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,900
right?
You better be able to maintain it.

1083
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,720
It sort of openness to the world.
Even as you're learning,

1084
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,690
you better not get too arrogant.
Like if you go down that checklist,

1085
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,840
I find a lot of them really apply to my 
writing and ways that,

1086
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,860
that are,
that are more direct than I ever would 

1087
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,091
have thought would be the case.
I didn't start kind of thinking about 

1088
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:56,361
this till I was in my thirties,
which is also rather on the time that I 

1089
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:58,050
started becoming a better human,
um,

1090
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,190
uh,
but you know,

1091
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:04,191
to really think about like getting 
caught short at times or engaging in 

1092
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,930
something where I'm so adamant that I'm 
right about it.

1093
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,150
And then reflecting on it afterwards and
realizing that I'm wrong.

1094
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:12,930
And it's like there's so much fodder.
That's where all the gold is in writing.

1095
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:18,410
That's where all those pieces are and 
really paying attention to people and 

1096
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,730
not overlooking their own quiet everyday
tragedies and recognizing their everyday

1097
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,980
triumphs because that's what rounds out 
of character.

1098
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:31,981
If you can capture that,
all of a sudden you feel like you're 

1099
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:31,981
reading something that's alive and if 
you don't,

1100
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:34,150
you're reading something that you feel 
like is fill in the blanks.

1101
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,180
You know?
And especially with with a forum like,

1102
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,520
like a thriller,
Crime Fiction,

1103
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:44,470
which I'm far from denigrating.
I think it's an incredible forum.

1104
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,270
I think that's interesting too.
Is that you,

1105
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,680
that's a form that you've stuck with in 
many ways throughout your writing 

1106
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,330
career.
And that's been about 20,

1107
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,550
20.
You have 23 books now.

1108
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,610
I have a seven,
17 or 18 out maybe.

1109
00:57:01,611 --> 00:57:03,310
And three more than the pyre lot.

1110
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,880
Okay.
So you've been basically putting out 

1111
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:08,880
something like a book a year.
Yeah.

1112
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,400
So there's,
there's two places we could go with 

1113
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,991
that.
One is that I'd like to talk with you a 

1114
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:17,260
little bit about how you've actually 
managed to have a successful career as a

1115
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,690
writer because that's a very difficult 
thing to pull off.

1116
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:25,110
And the other issue is why you've,
you've inserted yourself in this very 

1117
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:31,171
limited form,
John Reform and I'm curious about why 

1118
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:36,871
that one and also what it is about the 
genre and the fact that it's a very,

1119
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,990
very commercial and very attractive in a
sort of,

1120
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,790
I wouldn't say easy way,
but in a very accessible way.

1121
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,960
It,
it's very accessible to people.

1122
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:49,390
And so what's,
what's the attraction,

1123
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,540
like why not?
It's something that's arguably more 

1124
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:54,540
literary.

1125
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,020
Well I don't,
I mean the first thing is,

1126
00:57:56,021 --> 00:58:01,021
is it's like it's not selected.
Like I can only write stuff that I feel 

1127
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:06,251
in my gut that I need to write.
And fortunately for me from a financial 

1128
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:10,640
perspective that tends to be stuff that 
that's highly commercial.

1129
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,290
But you know,
one of the things I think about,

1130
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:12,810
like for me,
the,

1131
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:14,930
the,
the gold standard is always hitchcock.

1132
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:19,931
Like no one's like,
oh see commercial or was he a critical 

1133
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,440
six ass?
And what's interesting is,

1134
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:21,900
you know,
you talked,

1135
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,050
we talked about all this stuff that we 
only see in hindsight,

1136
00:58:24,051 --> 00:58:29,051
like you follow only the things that are
of interest and then in hindsight they 

1137
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:29,051
all make sense.
So.

1138
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:33,911
Right?
So in college I studied English and 

1139
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,741
psychology as you know,
you were there and I got really 

1140
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:37,880
fascinated with shakespearian tragedy in
particular and it's like,

1141
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,340
okay,
so I'm studying young Ian,

1142
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,180
analysis of Shakespearian tragedy.

1143
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,410
All that is about narrative.
All of it is narrative.

1144
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,420
I only chose it because I was 
interested.

1145
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,950
I got,
I was very into Freud,

1146
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:49,820
you know,
those case studies.

1147
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:51,530
We'd like short stories,
but.

1148
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:53,030
So it's like,
let's take Shakespeare.

1149
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:58,690
Okay,
so why would shakespeare choose this 

1150
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:58,690
form?
That is limited,

1151
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,110
right?
Everything's got five back.

1152
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:03,050
He basically wrote a highly convention 
bound,

1153
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:08,230
highly structured narrative driven form,
sometimes tipping into propaganda that 

1154
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:12,950
deals with last intriguing murderer 
designed to sell out the most,

1155
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,560
you know,
he's the most seats in the globe theater

1156
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:20,590
to put asses in chairs.
He had no interest in enduring literary 

1157
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:20,590
value,
you know,

1158
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,490
um,
a lot of people are interested in during

1159
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:23,960
literary value,
don't enduring,

1160
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:27,650
we don't tend to.
Enduro is another discussion,

1161
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,820
but when you cut that glue,
yeah,

1162
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,440
I,
you cut the globe theater and half and 

1163
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:36,440
it's a perfect cross section of 
Elizabeth and society.

1164
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,500
So I'll have a joke from audit to 
metamorphosis and then he'll make a dick

1165
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:42,650
joke for the groundlings.
He's trying to appeal everywhere.

1166
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,840
And within the,
the,

1167
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,890
the,
the,

1168
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,480
within the constraints of the form,
there is a liberation.

1169
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:55,481
So he takes the Jew of Malta in terms of
the merchant of Venice in very few 

1170
00:59:55,481 --> 00:59:56,690
original plots.
Right.

1171
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,960
And so there's this reworking of trying 
to do something that's great within a 

1172
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,431
form that's recognizable,
but I think it's recognizable because 

1173
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:07,100
it's pleasingly archetypal and people 
forget,

1174
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,060
you know,
look,

1175
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,860
this can movies.
The Stranger was,

1176
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,570
was inspired by James and Keynes.
The Postman always rings twice,

1177
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,340
like these forms are,
are,

1178
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:16,840
are,
you know,

1179
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:20,380
you want to talk about existentialism.
You,

1180
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,780
these chandler.
Oh yeah.

1181
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:29,080
You know,
so there's an enormous amount and it's 

1182
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,231
been,
it's been said quite often that that 

1183
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:33,020
door is modern tragedy,
but instead of falling from the throne,

1184
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,940
you're falling from the curb into the 
gutter,

1185
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:35,210
right?

1186
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:40,210
You're just starting lower.
It's also been said the crime fiction 

1187
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,480
has replaced the social novel.
And if you look at,

1188
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,370
um,
you know,

1189
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,890
you look at like Mr wherever from Dennis
Lehane,

1190
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,100
it's like that.
That's such an interesting story,

1191
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:49,490
right?
You know,

1192
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,520
I wrote a book called town allies takes 
place in San Francisco that is built 

1193
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,391
around a thriller,
but it's all about class in society and 

1194
01:00:58,391 --> 01:00:59,390
ethics in San Francisco.
And in a weird way for me,

1195
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:02,630
when I'm playing with these notions of 
intimacy versus perfection,

1196
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:06,770
when I'm playing with this notion of a,
you know,

1197
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,960
aging versus focus,
um,

1198
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,860
the themes around humanity about being 
better,

1199
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,950
if I can wrap them in what I hope is an 
enormously entertaining page turning 

1200
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,700
story that's propulsive that people want
to read.

1201
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,840
That's the kind of thing that I most 
enjoy and engage in that for me,

1202
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:28,010
sort of the ultimate win.

1203
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,530
I'm going to get to write about 
everything that I want to write about in

1204
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:35,531
as exciting and compelling fashion that 
I can manage within the restraints of my

1205
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:38,420
skill.
And I don't do that as having a ceiling.

1206
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,920
You know,
I don't think anyone's going to come 

1207
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:43,920
along and go,
you know,

1208
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,480
look,
mcbath pretty lacking on the,

1209
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,940
on the quality scale,
you know,

1210
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:50,150
you look at.
And so there's always an aim for it.

1211
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:52,160
And also I just love thrillers,
you know,

1212
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:57,161
instead of writing a thriller with more 
meat on the bones where I'm really 

1213
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,040
stretching and there there's a number of
people to do it in the forum.

1214
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,240
And so I,
I'm the only one,

1215
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,090
um,
it's just a great,

1216
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,430
it's a great focus and you know,
again,

1217
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:07,430
if you don't focus on something,
where do you wind up?

1218
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:13,590
And also look,
this goes back to narrative to 

1219
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,731
archetypal narrative too,
like I believe that there are 

1220
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,161
fundamentally fundamental story 
structures and that our is selected for 

1221
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:19,320
as opposable thumbs and islands.
You know,

1222
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:19,800
and I think

1223
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,560
you'll find a tribe that's been,
you know,

1224
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:24,630
in the middle of the Amazon,
the ted no exposure.

1225
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:26,280
And we'll have eyelids,
opposable thumbs,

1226
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:29,130
and a hero archetype.
This is the archetype.

1227
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,060
Gilgamesh is a thriller.
You know,

1228
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,410
Beowulf is a kick ass thriller.
That's what those things are.

1229
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,720
And that's the form that just appeals to
me.

1230
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,910
You know,
Moses,

1231
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,830
the exodus is the thriller.
Yeah.

1232
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:41,700
The Ta,
you know,

1233
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:46,701
I look,
I collect faulkner paperbacks from the 

1234
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:48,981
fifties and they're insane.
Like they have these Harlequin type 

1235
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:49,480
covers,
you know,

1236
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,700
like another from America's leading 
purveyor of murder and lust.

1237
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,690
William Faulkner,
I mean,

1238
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:59,691
they were packaged as such,
but you read sanctuary with the 

1239
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:00,210
courtroom case and the corn cob.
I mean,

1240
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,210
good God,
there's,

1241
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,170
you know,
he's,

1242
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:02,920
he's got,
he's,

1243
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:07,921
he's up to his elbows and in Jordan 
certain genre conventions as originally 

1244
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,840
went to Hollywood and adapted Chandler 
novels.

1245
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,510
Great.
Great.

1246
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:11,910
Great.
You know,

1247
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:16,440
so for me it's all about.
I mean he already slug away.

1248
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,660
Yes.
Yeah.

1249
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:23,661
Well then he also did the big sleep.
I want to say I need someone to freight 

1250
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,160
back checked out to make sure I got that
one right.

1251
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,120
But,
you know,

1252
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,370
I'm,
yeah,

1253
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,100
that's true.
You know,

1254
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,780
at the end of the data,
like I,

1255
01:03:31,781 --> 01:03:36,781
I am a structure slot.
I think structure is essential structure

1256
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,200
slumped.
Watch me structure slut and fun and 

1257
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,480
that,
that'll be my website instead of young 

1258
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,940
women who are symmetrically perfect and 
represent a particular gummy and ideal.

1259
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,520
Um,
but I,

1260
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,880
I feel like I like to know where I am 
within a story.

1261
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,810
You know,
I like to,

1262
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,030
I'd like to know where the terms are.
I can,

1263
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,920
I like to play with them lies with 
Batman.

1264
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,620
We talked about once you have the 
conventions,

1265
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:09,621
you can start to play with them.
You can start to find more elbow room 

1266
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:09,621
within them.

1267
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:13,340
Yeah,
well that's a nice thing too is that 

1268
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,010
people often think about creative 
freedom as the freedom for many 

1269
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,930
structural impositions whatsoever.
And that's,

1270
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,760
that's the Peter Pan thing or what did 
you call your character?

1271
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:22,660
Castle.
Oh,

1272
01:04:22,661 --> 01:04:24,530
casserole casserole.
Yeah,

1273
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,290
without obstruction.
And without limits,

1274
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:31,080
you have freedom.
It's like you don't just have chaos.

1275
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,660
Well,
and I have like,

1276
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:37,680
you know,
having written all these novels and the 

1277
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:37,680
nowhere,
man,

1278
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,650
there's one novel did something really.
I'm sorry,

1279
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:43,651
there's one chapter that something 
really bad happens to Evan and each 

1280
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:47,641
chapter in the orphan accent in the 
Norman has a title that's taken from 

1281
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:51,901
something in the chapter,
usually a sort of humorous way that it 

1282
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:56,671
can be double rent,
but it's a phrase from the chapter as a 

1283
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:58,881
chapter heading.
And so one of the chapters after this 

1284
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:01,561
horrific thing happen to evan is just 
cold and the whole chapter is just the 

1285
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:02,950
word cold.
That's the whole chapter.

1286
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,020
So one more chapter and then you move 
on.

1287
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,140
So it's,
that's not conventional writing.

1288
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,370
I'm not,
you know,

1289
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,970
there's ways that you can start to play 
once you're within it,

1290
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,880
but you know,
I don't want to write in a whole,

1291
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:20,881
you know,
book in Haiku and like the mass 

1292
01:05:20,881 --> 01:05:24,211
experimentation or you know,
I wrote a book called a crime writer 

1293
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,510
where I literally,
it's a crime writer who lands on 

1294
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,250
something that's in the middle of 
seemingly one of his own story.

1295
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:33,250
He's a disaster situation and he 
realizes that in order to understand 

1296
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:33,250
what happened,
he has to write it down.

1297
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:38,190
So then I introduced a typewriter font.
That's the first sentence of the book 

1298
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,790
that we read or the first paragraph of 
the book.

1299
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:44,791
And then at a certain point his editor 
comes in and has hand written edits in 

1300
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:48,631
the margins of the typewriter so that we
see the development process of the 

1301
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:52,831
writing,
which mirrors the process of his own 

1302
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:55,891
writing.
Which is the story of what happened to 

1303
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:55,891
him,
which has been all of that.

1304
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:58,831
We're reading.
So there's all these ways that you can 

1305
01:05:58,831 --> 01:05:58,831
play within the form to make an 
interesting.

1306
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:01,570
But at the end of the day,
I want to know where I am in a story.

1307
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,980
That's what always appeals to me.

1308
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,340
Great.
So look,

1309
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,150
let's,
let's,

1310
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:10,770
I'd like you to talk a little bit about,
about your career from a practical sense

1311
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:14,190
too because you've been able to maintain
it for a long time.

1312
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:20,220
So I think people would be interested to
know what your typical,

1313
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:25,140
how you learn to write and what your 
typical day looks like.

1314
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:30,260
I don't know what we're passing like 
across the last 20 years because one of 

1315
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:33,921
the strange things about being an 
independent artist is that you don't 

1316
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:41,871
have those external constraints 
precisely driving you the same way that 

1317
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:42,070
you do.
If you have to go to work everyday.

1318
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:47,090
If you have to be up at nine for someone
else and it's very easy for people to 

1319
01:06:47,431 --> 01:06:52,431
drift in a situation like that because 
you can always put off what you have to 

1320
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:56,361
do until tomorrow.
Or You could also always substitute the 

1321
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:56,361
long,
medium,

1322
01:06:56,361 --> 01:07:00,921
or longer term ambition for something 
short term that needs to be done right 

1323
01:07:00,921 --> 01:07:05,121
now.
So let's start out by how you learn to 

1324
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:05,121
write.

1325
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,790
I never did a writing course or read a 
book on writing.

1326
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,620
I mean,
how do you learn to write a novel,

1327
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,240
you know,
2000 novels and then you try and write 

1328
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,420
one and screw it up.
That's it.

1329
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,860
Same with screenplays,
you know,

1330
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:23,200
watch a million movies.
Love the thing itself.

1331
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,260
My first book,
I wrote a disastrous first draft.

1332
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:31,290
I mean the,
the end of each chapter was better than 

1333
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,081
the beginning,
literally from what I've learned while 

1334
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:34,081
writing the chapter.
But again,

1335
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:38,550
don't be afraid.
I've had two things that have benefited 

1336
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:38,550
me a lot.
One is I'm not afraid to fail,

1337
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,200
I'm not afraid to embarrass myself.
Um,

1338
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:45,980
and I also don't have any delay between 
wanting to try something and trying it.

1339
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,730
Like I don't hold back and wait and 
think about it.

1340
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,530
And I just was like,
I want to write a novel.

1341
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:53,320
I'm 19.
I think I know more than I do.

1342
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:55,210
I'm just going to jump in and do it.
I wrote it.

1343
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,940
I had a really shitty first draft,
the vomit draft.

1344
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:02,140
I sat down and took it apart like an 
engine block and then I looked at it all

1345
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:04,420
and reconstructed as,

1346
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,520
what do you mean exactly?

1347
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:12,400
It's kind of just kind of chapter by 
chapter and like this plot isn't working

1348
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:17,401
and this is two longest stretch without 
action and this character developed 

1349
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:17,401
enough.
You know,

1350
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:19,680
I took the chapters out and it felt like
I did it.

1351
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,670
My first draft was half the length of 
the final model.

1352
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:28,170
Um,
it wasn't till my third novel that I 

1353
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,050
wrote a rough draft that could 
constitute an awful on its own.

1354
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,580
It's functioned.

1355
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:36,690
Yeah.
So part of what you were doing was 

1356
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:37,600
separating the production end of the 
process from the editing end.

1357
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,400
I mean,
that's what,

1358
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,460
that's what a bad first draft doses you 
allow it.

1359
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,700
Yeah.
And I,

1360
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,800
you know,
and then as I get further along,

1361
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:49,110
it's like I like my first draft now is 
what my 10th draft used to be.

1362
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,150
Right.
It keeps it,

1363
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,730
it keeps sort of evolving,
but then know all,

1364
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,740
try something new like orphan x.
I did more rewriting on than any of my 

1365
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,131
previous six books.
It still wasn't anywhere close to my 

1366
01:09:02,131 --> 01:09:02,131
first,
you know,

1367
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:07,110
three dolls,
but if I really was doing something new,

1368
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,120
I was building an entire character and 
entire mythology and launching this big 

1369
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:17,490
new franchise into the world.
And so in some ways I overrode it and 

1370
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,120
pull stuff back that I save for future 
books.

1371
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,010
I mean,
so I'd say that's one part of it.

1372
01:09:21,011 --> 01:09:25,320
The other is I think it might've been 
advised you gave me when I was shadowing

1373
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:30,340
or 18,
but you said when it comes to writing 

1374
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:30,580
and if you didn't say we can just 
pretend that you did.

1375
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:35,580
We'll give you credit for gambling.
I'm taking credit that then you leave 

1376
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,340
me.
If it's not wise,

1377
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,600
then they'll be like Wiley,
coyote out over the cliff.

1378
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,330
Just watch.
We all know.

1379
01:09:43,331 --> 01:09:48,160
But you said there's always going to be 
a dozen things that are more pressing to

1380
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:49,090
do then.
Right.

1381
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:54,360
Always.
And if you don't decide to make that 

1382
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,660
time sort of holy and protected,
nobody else will do that for you.

1383
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,800
And that's essential.
And I was already kind of into my first 

1384
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,430
book and doing it and I thought that's 
exactly right.

1385
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,020
Like it's always more pressing to clean 
the house or pick up your dry cleaning 

1386
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:12,391
or you know,
pick up one of your kids if you don't 

1387
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:12,391
just carve it out.
It's not like I'm a surgeon,

1388
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:17,370
I'm in an office,
one of those monster surgeons where I'm 

1389
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:17,890
in an office and no one can reach me.

1390
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:22,890
And my day is sad.
I mean at any time right now I could be 

1391
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,520
disturbed all the time by anyone.
My phone can ring.

1392
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:26,650
So unless I say this is my writing 
schedule,

1393
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:28,180
I'm unplugged,
you know,

1394
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:33,181
kids leave me alone unless someone is on
fire or the house is on fire and it is 

1395
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:38,060
us.
I need the same amount of space that I 

1396
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,350
would have Brian Accountant or a 
psychologist or you know,

1397
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,080
a doctor or a lawyer,
you know.

1398
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,000
And so I had to make that time kind of 
holy are sacrosanct.

1399
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:51,660
And then I would say the other thing is 
that mattered a lot is I realized early 

1400
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,130
on that the one thing I'll say,
there's two other pieces that I'll say.

1401
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,700
The one thing that I could control 
absolutely was discipline.

1402
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,680
That's the only controllable thing and 
it's such an impossible field and so you

1403
01:11:02,681 --> 01:11:03,880
have to wait for luck.

1404
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,440
And I had a lot of luck early,
which I don't say with false humility or

1405
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:13,441
fishing for compliments.
Like my first book was good and I think 

1406
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:13,860
it was sellable and there's a lot of 
first books that good in sellable.

1407
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,110
You never know when that luck's going to
come.

1408
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:21,140
And I thought in sort of work ethics,
if I flap my wings as hard as I could 

1409
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:23,790
that I'm just bumping along the ceiling 
all the time.

1410
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,870
The one moment that that hatch opens,
that the lucky break comes,

1411
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,910
I was going to be right there to fly 
through it.

1412
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,420
And so from day one I was like,
I'm going full speed all the way no 

1413
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:35,910
matter what.
And I still do.

1414
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:40,911
I mean,
I still feel like the one thing I can 

1415
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:40,911
control is I've never been late on a 
deadline,

1416
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:43,380
you know,
and I write all day every day I built it

1417
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:44,400
up like a muscle.

1418
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,990
So how much time do you spend writing in
a date now?

1419
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:53,010
At minimum I write from six to 4:30
or five on laundry days.

1420
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:56,670
If I'm on deadline or if I'm near the 
end of a book and I can smell it,

1421
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,990
it will be 13,
14,

1422
01:11:57,991 --> 01:11:59,970
15,
sometimes 16 hours.

1423
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:02,850
And I've had spells of,
like I said,

1424
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,210
I once wrote a script for a TV show and 
1:23

1425
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:11,211
hours sitting because there was a risk 
that a micro economy in Vancouver would 

1426
01:12:11,211 --> 01:12:12,500
shut down if I did it.
If there's a shutdown,

1427
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,730
the show,
it's problematic.

1428
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:20,030
So I can go when I go.
But at a minimum I'm writing all day 

1429
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:20,030
every day,
you know,

1430
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:24,710
with a break to work out in the middle.
And the other thing I'd say is really 

1431
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:24,710
interesting is like,
you know,

1432
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:30,350
it's funny seeing which values get.
So people look at my resume and I went 

1433
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,971
to all these fancy schools and people 
always ask me like they asked me about 

1434
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:38,841
Shakespeare,
the throughout my educational 

1435
01:12:38,841 --> 01:12:38,841
background.

1436
01:12:38,841 --> 01:12:41,030
Okay.
You studied English and here you went 

1437
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,281
and did a masters in England.
I think in some ways one of the biggest 

1438
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:47,121
values for me was being was came from 
being an athlete because I was a pole 

1439
01:12:47,121 --> 01:12:47,750
vaulter in college.
Right.

1440
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,760
I played soccer growing up.
I played soccer in England and writing 

1441
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:54,510
is like training.
It's like working out.

1442
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:59,540
It's building a muscle.
And as with pole vaulting when I was 

1443
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,961
training day 27,
when the heptathlon will championships 

1444
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:07,071
were on day 275,
I have 100 things more important to do 

1445
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,480
than train on day 27 and know that I 
have to go that far.

1446
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,440
That's like a 27 or writing a novel,
you know.

1447
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:17,450
And so there's a lot of,
I think people undervalue the value 

1448
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,270
sports now for health and for,
you know,

1449
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:23,271
being active and being well rounded,
but we don't tend to talk about the 

1450
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:24,690
values that they instill and a lot of 
like discipline,

1451
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,730
longterm planning,
you know,

1452
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:31,731
like I,
when I was in high school I sucked at 

1453
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:31,731
pole vaulting.

1454
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:33,240
I mean my whole first year I was too 
small to bend the pole.

1455
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:38,330
Sophomore year it was awful.
And we're talking to is a three year 

1456
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,170
process to build up to start jumping at 
a high level and eventually,

1457
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,510
you know,
at a national level and then in college.

1458
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:47,540
But it takes a lot of discipline.
And so there's the discipline aspect of 

1459
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,560
writing I think is really important.
And then,

1460
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,180
you know,
for people starting out,

1461
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:56,210
one of the things I say is like,
pick a certain amount of time that you 

1462
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,390
do no matter what and force yourself to 
get stuff on the page.

1463
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,110
And if you say all I could find is an 
hour day or two hours a day,

1464
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,520
uh,
or I'm sorry,

1465
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,200
two hours,
twice a week.

1466
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:09,620
That will soon turn into two hours and 
15 minutes or two hours and two and a 

1467
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,220
half hours.
It will expand itself as your discipline

1468
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:11,590
goes on.

1469
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,530
It's like running and the other thing I 
say is that,

1470
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,160
look,
I mean a lot of people who want to be 

1471
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:20,160
writers and I meet very few who actually
want to write.

1472
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,420
I love writing.
I actually loved the writing process.

1473
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,700
If you don't,
don't do this.

1474
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:32,730
There's a million other things you can 
do and make more money and it's easier 

1475
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,210
and you can be happier.
And when you say you love it,

1476
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:39,240
what do you mean exactly?
I mean that doesn't mean it's easy by 

1477
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,770
any stretch of the imagination.
What does it mean exactly?

1478
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:42,580
What do you mean by that?

1479
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:47,050
Well,
it's,

1480
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,200
it's the one place I really clearly lose
time.

1481
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,790
You know,
when things are going well,

1482
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,380
an hour and a half,
two hours will pass.

1483
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:55,180
That happens to me when I'm on the 
soccer field.

1484
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:59,950
Two is like I just,
I feel fully inhabited in something else

1485
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:04,360
aside from me in a manner that is 
productive and I feel like I don't.

1486
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:09,390
I'm not one for getting precious about 
writing with beckoning menus and 

1487
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:11,260
whatnot,
but like there's an ask,

1488
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,340
there's a part of pleasure.
I have these really loud keyboards that 

1489
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,561
I hammer on.
I've a whole broken slu or keyboards 

1490
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:19,780
that I've gone through.
I feel like a carpenter,

1491
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:24,781
I feel like I'm pounding and hammering 
and cutting and pasting and I liked the 

1492
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:28,441
keyboard to be really loud so then it's 
a muscular action and I just feel 

1493
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:32,950
utterly engaged and fascinated in what 
in this world that like I'm in control,

1494
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:38,100
but there's endless opportunities and my
job is to be open to opportunity while 

1495
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,331
also making sure that I'm kind of 
steering the ship and there's an 

1496
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:45,511
enormous amount of responsibility and at
the same time I'm living in a world of 

1497
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:48,340
my own making and holy alone.

1498
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,660
So first let's hear your keyboard.

1499
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:01,910
Yeah,
you just like the 19 thirties newsroom 

1500
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:02,720
or if my friends joke with me about as 
the.

1501
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,500
When they're on the phone and if I'm 
rude enough to be writing or finishing a

1502
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:12,501
sentence there would say you sound like 
the asshole travel agent where they 

1503
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:12,870
can't move your flight.
We're like,

1504
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:14,430
okay,
so Dallas has shut down.

1505
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:16,880
Can I go through Chicago?
No,

1506
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,300
I'm terribly sorry.
Can Be an issue.

1507
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,160
Can we get me?
No,

1508
01:16:20,161 --> 01:16:22,230
I'm sorry.
Your flight's been delayed six hours.

1509
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:27,260
I mean it's still loud.
Old fashioned angry travel agent 

1510
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:27,260
keyboard.
Right,

1511
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,320
right.
It's very funny.

1512
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,670
So.
So your toe.

1513
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:35,700
Yeah.
So you talked about discipline and you 

1514
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,050
talked about responsibility.
When you're writing,

1515
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:39,390
like what do you mean by that exactly?
Well,

1516
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:43,440
your ego is constantly subservient to 
the plot,

1517
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:48,470
so to write,
well you come up with a basic set of 

1518
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,660
tenants that start your story.
It's like,

1519
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,500
it's,
it's like,

1520
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,360
it's so complex.
It's like,

1521
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,970
it's like surfing,
like there's so many factors.

1522
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,620
So when people are like,
you know,

1523
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,720
there's,
there's sort of like the idiot criticism

1524
01:16:57,721 --> 01:17:01,380
of certain movies like you know,
passenger,

1525
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:06,381
57,
you remember where Wesley Snipes is the 

1526
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:08,571
super bad ass Spec ops guy on the 
airplane that gets hijacked and some 

1527
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:11,691
people are like,
well what are the odds that you'd be on 

1528
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:11,691
plane that got hijacked?

1529
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:11,691
And you're like,
well,

1530
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:15,770
it's 100 percent because no one wants to
write a story about the other 99,000,

1531
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:19,760
999 times that a plane got hijacked and 
passenger 57 wasn't on it.

1532
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,770
Like that's why we're writing this 
story.

1533
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,650
So you have a unique set of 
circumstances that can involve,

1534
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,310
that can involve coincidence at the 
outset.

1535
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,590
That's first act stuff,
right?

1536
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,030
So,
okay,

1537
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:37,031
this is a story about the one time that 
an orphan who was taken out of her 

1538
01:17:37,031 --> 01:17:39,170
program at the age of 12 and trained to 
be an assassin,

1539
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:44,560
you know,
left the program because his moral 

1540
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:44,560
compass was broken.
And that's his story.

1541
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,910
It's like whatever you think the odds of
that are,

1542
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:51,940
that's the narrative contract.
That's what I'm doing and I can't 

1543
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,530
introduce them in the third act of a 
realism based mystery.

1544
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,280
That's a drawing room,
Mr.

1545
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,790
that takes place in Vermont.
So we set the course of that.

1546
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,360
Right.
Okay.

1547
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:03,470
So that's the contract with the 
narrative contract and the contract with

1548
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,150
the reader.
You don't get to break.

1549
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,500
You say,
look,

1550
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,050
give me leeway while I set this up.

1551
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:10,800
Yeah.
Here's the coincidence,

1552
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:16,350
the coincidence,
or here's the unlikely set of 

1553
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,521
circumstances that are why I have 
decided to sit down at my type 

1554
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:23,100
typewriter sounding keyboard and 
devoting your life to this.

1555
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,690
Okay,
so we're all in on that.

1556
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:29,970
Then you round out your characters and 
what you want us to give them freedom.

1557
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,420
But you're also steering like,
I don't believe all this stuff that 

1558
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:35,420
like,
you know,

1559
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,901
oh my gosh,
I just start to channel everything and 

1560
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:38,901
it's magic.
Like you're controlling it.

1561
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:39,360
But when I'm writing,
well,

1562
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:43,230
I have characters who are wittier than I
am in real time.

1563
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,180
Not Meaning,
like one of the things that's great with

1564
01:18:45,181 --> 01:18:50,181
writing books is that a year later,
go back with the perfect comeback to,

1565
01:18:51,091 --> 01:18:51,660
uh,
you know,

1566
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:54,240
like I have a year to come up with and 
polished the dialogue.

1567
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:59,241
And that's great.
So whenever you've been in a party and 

1568
01:18:59,241 --> 01:18:59,241
someone slights here when you're driving
home going,

1569
01:18:59,241 --> 01:18:59,940
oh,
I shouldn't have said that.

1570
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:04,170
We get to say that when we're writing.
But I've had that happen in real time.

1571
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:07,410
So there's something that starts to go 
on with characters as you engage in them

1572
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:12,770
that they're doing stuff that I feel 
like I'm typing just behind it 

1573
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,700
happening,
like it's just moving and that's a great

1574
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:17,880
feeling and there's this really weird 
thing that you want to get to,

1575
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:22,881
which is by the end of a book,
the conclusion should feel at once 

1576
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:26,991
inevitable and unpredictable.
So you want to have things happen and 

1577
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:32,750
we've all had that.
I don't know if some people had it with 

1578
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,380
the success some people had it with.
We've all had that feeling in a movie or

1579
01:19:34,381 --> 01:19:39,381
reading a book where you're right on the
lip of discovery and then the thing 

1580
01:19:39,381 --> 01:19:39,630
happens and you're like,
oh my God,

1581
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:43,390
that makes so much sense and completely 
caught me off guard at the same time.

1582
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:45,630
That's the win,
right?

1583
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,100
And so you need to sort of.
You have a responsibility to always make

1584
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:54,450
your needs subservient to the plot.
Like the story is paramount.

1585
01:19:55,170 --> 01:20:00,170
And so as much as you're the creator,
you have to give free will to the story.

1586
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:04,050
You have to give stuff up that you don't
and wouldn't otherwise.

1587
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:08,310
I might have spent weeks research on 
something

1588
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,380
if it doesn't fit the story per our 
properly,

1589
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:11,310
I have to,
you know,

1590
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,990
they,
they call it killing your babies,

1591
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,460
right?
You have to get rid of it,

1592
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,170
you got to throw it out and you have to.

1593
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,370
It's really useful for,
I think,

1594
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,590
beginning writers to know that we 
touched on previously,

1595
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:26,620
which is that yeah,
you have to be willing to throw things 

1596
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:26,750
away.
Lots of things.

1597
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:31,780
I mean what I do to kind of take the 
sting out of that to some degree is I 

1598
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,540
always have a document open on my 
computer called Kols and I'll pull out a

1599
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:38,540
paragraph that doesn't fit and throw it 
in there and you know,

1600
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:41,360
there's always the possibility that I'll
find a place for it later.

1601
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,360
But often I do something with it later 
too.

1602
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,760
So the writing is necessarily.
But yeah.

1603
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,180
Well,
and you know,

1604
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,960
so you're,
you're trying to make everything work 

1605
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,690
and you're trying to be surprising at 
the same time.

1606
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:59,270
But also you have to be open to 
opportunity.

1607
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:04,271
And I,
I had my third book in particular learn 

1608
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:06,880
this because I got all the way to the 
end and the ending that I thought was 

1609
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,301
the exact opposite of the ending of the 
story that I had created and I realized 

1610
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:14,741
I had a choice.
I can either honor the story that I've 

1611
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:17,021
created and,
and make this thing that's better and 

1612
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:18,620
surprising and unplanned for.
Or I can write propaganda,

1613
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,480
I can see purpose story to my own means.
And like that's like,

1614
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,810
that's an brand,
right?

1615
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:26,900
It's like there's never going to be a 
shocking reveal where they're,

1616
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,280
you know,
in an an brand,

1617
01:21:28,281 --> 01:21:30,320
you know what it is and she's filling it
out.

1618
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:35,950
You know what all of her thoughts are.
So the writing for is in a process of 

1619
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:39,281
discovery necessarily.
It's a process of furthering the set of 

1620
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:39,281
philosophical points

1621
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:42,330
she does.
That's second rate,

1622
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:45,330
I think is that all her heroes and all 
her villains,

1623
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,600
like all her heroes are the same hero 
and all her villains are the same 

1624
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,411
villain.
And all the villains are completely 

1625
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:56,631
villainous.
And all the heroes are completely 

1626
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:56,631
heroic.

1627
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:56,631
Well,
snaps.

1628
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:56,631
Propaganda.
Yes,

1629
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:57,010
yes.
Well,

1630
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:59,740
it's exactly the opposite of Dostoevsky,
you know,

1631
01:21:59,741 --> 01:22:04,741
where he makes his,
his villains are more heroic than his 

1632
01:22:04,741 --> 01:22:06,870
heroes by a substantial margin he makes 
superman to,

1633
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,460
to,
to argue against fundamentally.

1634
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,940
Right.
And so,

1635
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
you know,
one is about being open and the other 

1636
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,150
thing I would say with writers is I see 
a lot here who were,

1637
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,140
you know,
and this is true for,

1638
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:24,160
you know,
fill in the blank for artistic feel and 

1639
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:24,160
a lot of people who were like,
you know,

1640
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,000
I went to beverly hills high,
I studied screenwriting Undergrad,

1641
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:30,990
I got a masters in screenwriting and 
here I go and I'm ready to go and I want

1642
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:31,680
to write.
And you're like,

1643
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:36,681
well,
what the hell are you going to write 

1644
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:36,681
about?
You know,

1645
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:38,781
a lot of people.
I think having a broad range of life 

1646
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:39,300
experiences important.
You know,

1647
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:40,920
there's some of the writers who I admire
the most.

1648
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:43,670
Like James Ellroy was like borderline 
homeless,

1649
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:48,770
not homeless for awhile,
just knocking about and figuring stuff 

1650
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,280
out and on jobs and like living out in 
the world.

1651
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,940
And so if you want to write this or,
or,

1652
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:57,950
or,
or create some sort of constructed 

1653
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:58,320
amalgam of previous things that have 
been constructed,

1654
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:02,640
go all the way through all the course 
work and do all that.

1655
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:03,270
But it,
it,

1656
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:05,980
it's huge benefit to just pursue 
anything that interests

1657
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,060
you because looking back it makes sense.
I don't know why I chose young,

1658
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,070
you know,
and looking in hindsight it's like,

1659
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,570
well no shit,
right?

1660
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,910
He didn't write about anything but 
storytelling,

1661
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:20,530
but I didn't choose him in some way.
And I remember even in college,

1662
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:22,690
so I was an English and psychology,
but like I,

1663
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,440
I sort of wanted to,
you know,

1664
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,880
I took a course in opera and I took a 
course in classical music.

1665
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:30,790
I mean,
which I have zero aptitude for music,

1666
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,410
but I really was,
you know,

1667
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,380
in,
in art and all these different arenas to

1668
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:38,830
just have at least have a basis of 
things to write about.

1669
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,080
And I think the same is true for life 
experiences.

1670
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:46,081
Like do it,
a lot of stuff do stuff that's 

1671
01:23:46,081 --> 01:23:46,081
dangerous,
you know?

1672
01:23:46,081 --> 01:23:46,500
So let's.
Okay,

1673
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:48,990
so we should fill in a backstory here 
for people too,

1674
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,730
because I imagine there are somewhat 
curious,

1675
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,760
I mean I've known you for a long time.
We met when you were a student at 

1676
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,301
Harvard when I was teaching there and 
you're actually the only one of the 

1677
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:03,681
undergraduates that I knew there that 
I've kept up a relationship with over 

1678
01:24:03,681 --> 01:24:04,830
this protracted period of time,
um,

1679
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,380
for,
for a variety of reasons,

1680
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:12,410
but it's not like I didn't meet all 
sorts of remarkable undergraduates 

1681
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:12,690
there.
But um,

1682
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:13,970
do you,
uh,

1683
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
do you,
do you have any particular memories of 

1684
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,360
that period of time when we were 
interacting?

1685
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:24,550
I can certainly tell one story,
but I'll see what you come up with 

1686
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,550
first.

1687
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,460
Well,
I remember you were,

1688
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:31,580
I remember you were formal in a way that
I respected that because I still 

1689
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:37,341
remember we were,
we were friends or seeing each other 

1690
01:24:37,341 --> 01:24:37,341
outside of school for like four years 
before I finally was like,

1691
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,170
is it okay if I call you Jordan instead 
of Dr Peter said,

1692
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,520
and I think that the,
the,

1693
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:44,300
the,
the formals,

1694
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,660
maybe the wrong word,
you,

1695
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:46,230
you,
you,

1696
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,780
you,
you had a certain authority that I think

1697
01:24:48,781 --> 01:24:53,781
was key to the teaching process and you 
didn't Brooke Fools,

1698
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:59,690
I'm an all like if someone came in with 
an argument from either end of the 

1699
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:01,960
spectrum,
uh,

1700
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,840
from an ideological perspective,
you had no interest in us.

1701
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,940
And so that was really palatable for me.
And then I think what happened with,

1702
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,970
with young was that I like,
I just sort of fell in love with all of 

1703
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:14,700
that for like,
that just,

1704
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,040
it,
it,

1705
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:20,050
it's weird how much our interests 
aligned along those fronts because I had

1706
01:25:20,161 --> 01:25:25,161
been very interested obviously in 
storytelling and thrillers and all this 

1707
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:28,221
stuff,
but dealing with young and dealing with 

1708
01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:28,221
the shadow.

1709
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,320
We encountered some early political 
correctness there together.

1710
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:36,321
If I remember correctly,
because you were in the English 

1711
01:25:36,321 --> 01:25:38,391
department and you were studying 
Shakespeare and you wanted to study 

1712
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:41,070
Shakespeare from a union perspective,
and if I remember correctly,

1713
01:25:41,071 --> 01:25:44,430
at that time Shakespeare wasn't exactly 
popular in the English department and,

1714
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,350
and you was,
um,

1715
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,050
well,
Nazi.

1716
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:49,530
Yeah,
exactly.

1717
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,700
The very opposite of popular.
So that was also very interesting.

1718
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:59,850
Yeah.
Well when I was hitting a lot of that 

1719
01:25:59,850 --> 01:25:59,850
though,
I think it wasn't,

1720
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,650
it didn't feel like it was the pitch 
that it was now,

1721
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:03,830
but it was at a sort of nineties were.

1722
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,100
And it also felt kind of more 
interesting where like,

1723
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,740
it felt more conversational,
a weird way.

1724
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,560
Like where people.
Like I had my favorite feminist,

1725
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:14,240
like I was like,
I really liked Naomi Wolf.

1726
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,190
Like someone,
what she says really makes sense to me.

1727
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:21,310
Like there was conversations about stuff
in a way that felt different and 

1728
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:25,690
there's,
there's sort of this rigidity now with 

1729
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:26,870
people snapping to both sides of the 
equation.

1730
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:28,920
But I mean,
I think one of the things that I,

1731
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:34,690
you know,
in our courses that I liked a lot was 

1732
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,241
that if somebody raised something that 
was clearly just some ideologically 

1733
01:26:37,241 --> 01:26:42,101
based,
here's what I'm supposed to be saying 

1734
01:26:42,101 --> 01:26:42,101
and reiterating,
you wouldn't have any tolerance for us.

1735
01:26:42,101 --> 01:26:44,120
And I always respected that because it 
was like,

1736
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:47,030
and it also wasn't from a perspective of
being shut down to it.

1737
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:49,040
It was like,
I love eating conversation that you want

1738
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:54,041
to have on the merits,
but I'm not going to engage in a 

1739
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:55,640
conversation with a false bit of 
scaffolding that you're inhabiting.

1740
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,510
It was sort of the vibe.
So that was interesting.

1741
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,290
Um,
so I written there.

1742
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,570
The thing I remember,
one of the things I remember was,

1743
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:09,870
and I'm sure you remember this too,
is that in one of my personality 

1744
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:13,171
classes,
I had asked the questions for a scale 

1745
01:27:13,171 --> 01:27:16,591
called the sensation seeking scale,
which was what of the early versions of 

1746
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:20,911
a big five variant and to sensation 
seeking scale asks people in park about 

1747
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,170
minor juvenile rule breaking.
I think shoplifting might've been one of

1748
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:31,171
the many ways.
And so I asked everyone questions and I 

1749
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:34,321
had them score it and then I asked 
people to put up their hands at each 

1750
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:39,900
level of increase in scores,
like are you in the bottom 10th 

1751
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,100
percentile percentile,
the 10th percentile or whatever.

1752
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:47,520
And if I remember correctly,
you were the only person who put up his 

1753
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,460
hand in the highest of the categories.
And if I also remember correctly,

1754
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:56,550
I laughed about that quite a bit.
And then if I also remembered correctly,

1755
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,150
you got a date out of that.

1756
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:03,220
Yeah.
Somebody asked me who is either like the

1757
01:28:03,221 --> 01:28:08,221
top percentile in sensation seeking or 
where will surgeon it was going to be 

1758
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,000
pretty much,
I pretty much hit it,

1759
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,100
but we should also keep in mind that 
this was at Harvard.

1760
01:28:13,101 --> 01:28:17,310
And so like the skills for like crazy 
sensation seeking daredevils,

1761
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:17,760
you know,

1762
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,930
one of the things that's going to be 
surprised about when I,

1763
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,980
when I administered that scale to the 
whole class was just how low the overall

1764
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:30,981
scores were.
And we know that conscientiousness is a 

1765
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:32,190
really good predictor of,
of academic performance.

1766
01:28:32,191 --> 01:28:34,980
And so I would say that,
you know,

1767
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:39,150
the kids there tended towards hyper 
conscientious miss more than towards say

1768
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,570
entrepreneurial,
the entrepreneurial sort of thing.

1769
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:47,890
It's like if you want the wind,
like we're talking about this from the 

1770
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:48,650
big five,
it's like obviously conscientiousness,

1771
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:51,430
better predictor in some ways than Iq,
right?

1772
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:56,580
On the street scale.
But it's like if you can have the talent

1773
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:02,140
and conscientiousness,
that's where you see people killing it 

1774
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:02,140
in like three or four

1775
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:03,870
shows.
I mean like that's just a win.

1776
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:05,550
And so,
you know,

1777
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:10,860
one,
it's rare to have that entrepreneurial 

1778
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,460
artistic,
creative ability and also to ally that 

1779
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,310
with say industriousness,
which is part of conscientiousness.

1780
01:29:14,311 --> 01:29:19,311
And it's rough too because the 
orderliness part of conscientiousness 

1781
01:29:19,311 --> 01:29:21,430
scenes to constrain creativity.
So there's a real big mean.

1782
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,130
One of the things we found,
for example,

1783
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:28,131
is that on the political continuum,
imagine that that runs from,

1784
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:31,410
from left liberal to conservative,
something like that.

1785
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:36,411
The fundamental one,
the conservatives are high in 

1786
01:29:36,411 --> 01:29:36,780
conscientiousness and low and 
creativity,

1787
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,570
but mostly what they're high end these 
orderliness.

1788
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,230
Whereas liberals are high in openness 
and low in orderliness.

1789
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:48,650
I'm one of the things that comes out of 
that that's really interesting is that 

1790
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,810
I've been thinking a lot about lately is
I've been trying to figure out why 

1791
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,720
conscientiousness and openness aren't 
correlated,

1792
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:59,721
so there's no real reason for them to 
lay together to predict political 

1793
01:29:59,721 --> 01:29:59,721
temperament.

1794
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:05,150
But one of the things that struck me 
really hard and I think trump's 

1795
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,571
discussion of the wall between the US 
and Mexico really got this active in my 

1796
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:12,591
mind,
was that as well as all this stuff I've 

1797
01:30:12,591 --> 01:30:14,010
been involved in recently with regards 
to what you can say and what you can say

1798
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:17,050
and and,
and that kind of political correctness,

1799
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:22,051
is that I think the fundamental 
political question boils down to whether

1800
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:26,340
borders should be opened or closed and 
high orderly,

1801
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:30,540
low creative people like everything to 
be in boxes and they don't get much of a

1802
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:35,541
kick out of the potential creative 
interplay that can come from loosening 

1803
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:40,521
the borders between things.
But they're also willing to subject 

1804
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:44,901
themselves to the discipline of order.
So that's one of the things that gives 

1805
01:30:44,901 --> 01:30:48,681
them an advantage.
But on the other side of the spectrum 

1806
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:48,681
with them

1807
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:48,681
willing.

1808
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,610
Yeah,
there is.

1809
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,370
They wouldn't think that up.
It's like,

1810
01:30:53,371 --> 01:30:54,810
oh look,
there's a wall.

1811
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:58,800
I better turn around to go home.
Well we could put a ladder over it.

1812
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,910
How would that work?
Or.

1813
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,220
Yes,
yes.

1814
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,600
That's,
that's different.

1815
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,080
The underground.

1816
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,550
Yes,
yes,

1817
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:07,800
exactly.
Well,

1818
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:12,090
and so the liberal types they like,
they like to uh,

1819
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:17,600
take advantage of the possibilities that
are set forth by breaking the borders 

1820
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,670
between things,
but they're also unwilling to accept the

1821
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:23,220
discipline that working within an 
orderly structure will,

1822
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,640
will provide anyways.
I think the border issue is pervasive at

1823
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:34,161
every level of analysis.
So the conservative types like the 

1824
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:35,250
borders around everything to remain 
tight,

1825
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,080
sexuality,
identity,

1826
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:40,920
nationality that the state itself,
whereas the more

1827
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,760
conventionally right now with trump and 
advocate,

1828
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:50,490
but conventionally conservatives are 
returned even though Clinton cooperative

1829
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,190
with like when it comes to money,

1830
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:58,900
it's sort of like only rules around 
maximizing money because free trade,

1831
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:00,060
I

1832
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:05,070
know that it's a funny one.
I mean you never get a pure 

1833
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:07,711
manifestation of these things.
I mean conservatives can be 

1834
01:32:07,711 --> 01:32:07,711
protectionists too at times.
Right?

1835
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:12,780
You know?
So I guess the political expression 

1836
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,321
depends to some degree on what's 
happening in the environment at that 

1837
01:32:16,321 --> 01:32:16,321
particular point.

1838
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,760
But Surf,
surfing all these walls is like.

1839
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,110
I mean that's the trick,
right?

1840
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:24,820
It's so much easier to armor yourself 
and one pure ideology.

1841
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,740
You know,
one of the things I think about a lot is

1842
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,320
with the skin,
so I've just gotten back from a two week

1843
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:34,370
for a two week leg of the tour.
I'm in a different city every day and 

1844
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:35,420
it's like it's reviews and it's readers 
and it's all the stuff.

1845
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:40,430
And I've been thinking a lot about how 
much work it takes to,

1846
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:44,950
not to stay open creatively but stay 
focused enough.

1847
01:32:44,951 --> 01:32:48,020
I'm pretty high in orderliness.
That's something that,

1848
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:48,490
that,
that,

1849
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,750
that,
that can interfere.

1850
01:32:49,751 --> 01:32:50,620
But it's weird because,
I mean,

1851
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:52,930
one of the things I think about,
it's like to be a writer,

1852
01:32:52,931 --> 01:32:57,931
you sort of need the sensitivity of a 
butterfly with the hide of a rhinoceros.

1853
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,960
Like you need to be so sensitive and 
attuned to things and also so willing to

1854
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,250
accept,
you know,

1855
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:11,251
rejection or negative reviews are all 
kinds of weird feedback and everything 

1856
01:33:11,251 --> 01:33:14,941
else.
And I'm saying this from someone who's 

1857
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:14,941
been fortunate enough to be largely 
successful,

1858
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:15,700
but it's still there.
There's a,

1859
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:20,730
there's a battering that you take when 
you try and advance something outside 

1860
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:25,081
the normal structure.
So you're starting to sound like 

1861
01:33:25,081 --> 01:33:25,081
Madonna.

1862
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:31,850
Oh,
I actually watched that speech she made 

1863
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,340
the other day and I think she's 
depressed actually.

1864
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,500
What was the speech?
What did I say that sounded like Madonna

1865
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,500
oven of the year award or something like
that.

1866
01:33:37,501 --> 01:33:42,501
I happened to watch a version of it 
where she was intercut with Milo 

1867
01:33:42,501 --> 01:33:43,890
Yiannopoulos,
which was actually quite comical.

1868
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:49,340
But uh,
she spent a lot of time complaining 

1869
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,860
about how hard it was to be Madonna and 
to be a woman.

1870
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,970
And I was watching it very carefully 
because she,

1871
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,660
she didn't say one positive thing about 
her life and I thought and she seemed to

1872
01:33:57,661 --> 01:34:01,350
be close to tears most of the time.
And I thought there's something wrong.

1873
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:06,630
She looked,
she looked at me like she was actually 

1874
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:06,630
depressed because it was,
you know,

1875
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:07,830
I mean,
she's had a pretty successful go of it.

1876
01:34:07,831 --> 01:34:10,420
And to only focus on the negative is,
is,

1877
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:12,030
is,
is kind of rough,

1878
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,960
so,

1879
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:16,690
but neither of those things are bad that
I'm,

1880
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:21,700
that I'm pointing to meaning like you 
want to be as sensitive as possible so 

1881
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:26,441
that you're attuned to constant kept 
this whole butterfly Rhinoceros Eminence

1882
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,080
image.
It's like,

1883
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:34,250
yeah,
I can see what I mean is there's a,

1884
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:39,310
there's a trick to trying to be floating
to maintain all your openness and also 

1885
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:45,461
be tough as hell like that.
That's sort of one of the ways to do it 

1886
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,700
because you need to blaze forward with 
it,

1887
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:50,670
with it like butterfly Rhinoceros 
blazing forward.

1888
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:51,340
Exactly.
Yeah,

1889
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,470
exactly.
Yeah.

1890
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,930
As,
as the common refrain is socrates said,

1891
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,800
a butterfly sting like a rhinoceros,
but when you're breaking away from those

1892
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:10,220
structures,
those structures,

1893
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:12,260
when you're in a space that's 
entrepreneurial,

1894
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,700
that's the chow.
I mean,

1895
01:35:13,701 --> 01:35:18,701
look,
that's part of the challenge that we're 

1896
01:35:18,701 --> 01:35:18,701
seeing people not resisting with group 
thing.

1897
01:35:18,701 --> 01:35:23,500
Like there's such a need to apparel and 
armor yourself in inset ideologies,

1898
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:28,110
you know,
and,

1899
01:35:28,111 --> 01:35:30,290
and to,
to have things be a certain way,

1900
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,180
to just go all the way off on 
orderliness.

1901
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:36,530
But to try and maintain high discipline,
I orderliness and high opendesk the.

1902
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,720
There's a constant tension that's 
moving.

1903
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,580
Yep.

1904
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:40,240
Yeah.
Well,

1905
01:35:40,241 --> 01:35:45,241
I think that that's partly why high 
level creative performances so rare is 

1906
01:35:45,241 --> 01:35:49,651
because it's very difficult to bring 
those things together because they 

1907
01:35:49,651 --> 01:35:49,750
actually.
They're mutually constraining.

1908
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:51,780
Well,
I think that's interesting.

1909
01:35:51,781 --> 01:35:56,781
For me,
I've worked with a lot of celebrities 

1910
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:58,380
who are at a fairly high level in the 
highest level,

1911
01:35:58,381 --> 01:36:03,381
let's just say whether it's acting or 
singing or household name people who,

1912
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,920
some of whom carry with it.
The press reputation of being smart and 

1913
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,361
some who do not.
The one thing that always amazes me is 

1914
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:17,601
like anyone at a certain level of fame,
how has the level of unbelievable.

1915
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:25,341
I'm sharpness,
like there's no one who accidentally 

1916
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:29,631
stumbled their way all the way up to 
having a top 10 hit or a number one 

1917
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:30,510
movie or something else.
It's very,

1918
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:35,511
very rare.
And so even people that we look at and 

1919
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:35,511
go,
that's some stupid celebrity.

1920
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:37,410
That's a dumb actor,
that's an idiot singer.

1921
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,420
People are running empires,
you know?

1922
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,720
And they somehow have to do that while 
keeping their antenna up and focused 

1923
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:49,851
and,
and letting enough end to keep creating 

1924
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:50,460
in a way that's meaningful.
Um,

1925
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:51,270
it's,
it's,

1926
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:56,330
I've yet to meet someone.
There's a lot of people who are a pain 

1927
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,821
in the ass,
but I've yet to meet people at that 

1928
01:36:58,821 --> 01:36:58,821
level.
I'm not impressed.

1929
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:02,500
One of the things I've learned in recent
years is to go watch famous people when 

1930
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:05,270
they come to Toronto,
no matter whether or not I like the.

1931
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:09,830
So for example,
I went and saw Dolly Parton with my wife

1932
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:13,340
about six months ago outside at the 
amphitheater.

1933
01:37:13,341 --> 01:37:18,341
And like,
I wouldn't say I'm a great fan of Dolly 

1934
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:18,341
Parton's music.
I mean,

1935
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:19,460
she's quite the phenomenon,
but,

1936
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:23,210
but she was absolutely amazing.
Absolutely amazing,

1937
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:24,710
brilliant,
witty,

1938
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:28,820
self denigrating,
a incredibly musically talented,

1939
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:33,200
a really engaging with the audience.
She really seemed to like to be there.

1940
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:34,340
It was a real treat.
And,

1941
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:38,150
and I agree with what you said,
is that it's a rare person who,

1942
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:43,180
especially who manages to sustain that 
across any amount of time who doesn't 

1943
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,810
have something truly remarkable about 
them.

1944
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,960
I'd also like to point out my 
magnanimity of not taking the open 

1945
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,750
revenge shot through your Madonna 
comment about you go into a Dolly Parton

1946
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:54,940
concert.
I just want,

1947
01:37:55,470 --> 01:38:00,470
I just want that knowledge and let the 
record show that I'm showing enormous 

1948
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,110
restricted at this point.
And you have the entire discussing.

1949
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,890
I'm very.
I'm very happy about that too,

1950
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,410
right?
Yeah.

1951
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:15,420
Have a movie coming out in June.
You want to talk a little bit about 

1952
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:15,420
that?
It's called the book of Henry.

1953
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,890
Um,
and it stars Naomi Watts.

1954
01:38:18,891 --> 01:38:21,500
We are Jacob Tremblay in it.
He's the boy from room.

1955
01:38:21,501 --> 01:38:23,180
Sarah Silverman,
who we mentioned earlier.

1956
01:38:23,181 --> 01:38:25,430
Dean Norris.
Terrific cast.

1957
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:29,330
I'm Maddie Ziegler who is amazing gate 
and leaving hers,

1958
01:38:29,331 --> 01:38:34,331
the boy from St Vincent and midnight 
special and it's about I'm constraint 

1959
01:38:35,241 --> 01:38:37,280
because we have a very kind of under 
wraps.

1960
01:38:37,281 --> 01:38:40,280
We want it to be a surprise.
It's a very unusual,

1961
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:41,990
very special kind of film.

1962
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:46,250
I wrote the rough draft of this,
the first draft 18 years ago.

1963
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:51,340
I,
this script has literally grown up with 

1964
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:51,340
me.
Um,

1965
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:51,930
and I,
it's,

1966
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:56,970
it's about a single mom.
Naomi Watts plays the character who is 

1967
01:38:56,970 --> 01:39:01,091
raising two boys,
one of whom is a prodigy and something 

1968
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:04,031
very bad is happening next door to them 
and working with her son who was a 

1969
01:39:04,551 --> 01:39:09,551
prodigy,
she has to figure out she's a lot like 

1970
01:39:09,551 --> 01:39:11,831
the child in the relationship and the 12
year old is more like the adults and 

1971
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:13,550
they have to sort of navigate through 
their way to a solution.

1972
01:39:13,551 --> 01:39:17,540
It has a very strong thriller elements.
It has some humor.

1973
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:22,541
I mean,
one of the things I said I was thinking 

1974
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:26,321
about is that I hope there's a lot of 
emotions in it that will catch people 

1975
01:39:26,321 --> 01:39:26,321
off guard.
Um,

1976
01:39:26,321 --> 01:39:31,120
and how it got made,
why it took so long to get made is it 

1977
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:31,120
was so unusual.

1978
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:34,150
How it got made was I found a director,
I'm off a movie called safety,

1979
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:39,551
not guaranteed that it's a wonderful 
little small independent movie called 

1980
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:45,040
Colin trevorrow.
And we were moving forward toward 

1981
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,040
production.
And then he said,

1982
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,770
look,
I just had a meeting with Spielberg.

1983
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,800
There's no conceivable way he would give
me Jurassic world off my tiny little 

1984
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,040
movie that costs probably less than the 
catering budget for Jurassic world,

1985
01:39:55,250 --> 01:40:00,250
but I just want to give you a heads up 
on two weeks later he called and was 

1986
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:00,250
like,
dude,

1987
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:02,750
I got dress mortal.
And so I lost him and he said to me,

1988
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:04,770
you never know.
Maybe that will reveal,

1989
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,880
you know,
make all this money,

1990
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,790
we can just come back and get this 
screen less.

1991
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,910
Um,
and so he went off and made it,

1992
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:13,580
you know,
maybe I think one point $7,000,000,000

1993
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:16,250
for universal and true to his word.

1994
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:20,180
And I have enormous regard for calling 
for a variety of reasons,

1995
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:21,950
but,
but this being one of them,

1996
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:24,170
you know,
he came back and called me and said,

1997
01:40:24,171 --> 01:40:29,171
well now I'm doing one of the next star 
wars movies and I have a window and 

1998
01:40:29,171 --> 01:40:32,330
let's shoot this thing and go.
And so we had the small window.

1999
01:40:32,331 --> 01:40:37,331
I did,
I did the rewrite in like four or five 

2000
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:37,331
days,
the production or garage.

2001
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:37,910
And we just,
he casts it like that.

2002
01:40:37,911 --> 01:40:42,911
I mean,
at that point he was someone who 

2003
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:42,980
everyone wanted to work with and off we 
went and it was amazing.

2004
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:43,640
It was like,
you know,

2005
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:46,310
18 years later,
an overnight success.

2006
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,700
Cool.
So yeah,

2007
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,170
that was good.
Great.

2008
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:54,310
We should probably call it quits.
I think it's been about 90 minutes,

2009
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,990
which seems to be about the right amount
of time,

2010
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:59,560
so thanks very much for talking with me 
and uh,

2011
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:05,110
well we'll talk soon and we'll see how 
this goes as a youtube video and as a 

2012
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:06,700
podcast.
So I think you'll be the first one up on

2013
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:11,750
the.
I'm going to hopefully do a number of 

2014
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:14,610
interviews.
I interviewed a Canadian composer 

2015
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:19,801
yesterday for 90 minutes as well,
but I think that one's going to take a 

2016
01:41:19,801 --> 01:41:20,170
little time to get the audio editing 
right.

2017
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:25,380
So you might be the first one out,
so obviously I'll let you know as soon 

2018
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,431
as possible.
Thanks very much for taking an hour and 

2019
01:41:29,431 --> 01:41:29,431
a half today.
Yeah,

2020
01:41:29,431 --> 01:41:29,431
thanks.
Thanks

2021
01:41:29,431 --> 01:41:30,530
for doing it.
This was great.

2022
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,560
All right,
talk soon.

2023
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:32,670
Bye.
Bye.
