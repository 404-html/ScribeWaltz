1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
So I'm here today with author Greg.
Greg is president of fire foundation for

2
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:29,751
individual rights in education and 
Jonathan Heit is an eminent social 

3
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,371
psychologist and professor of ethical 
leadership at New York University's 

4
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:37,961
Stern School of business.
They have coauthored a new book called 

5
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:42,351
the coddling of the American mind,
which is an elaborated version of a 

6
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:46,830
famous Atlantic monthly SSA.
They published a while back and so today

7
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:51,831
we're here to talk about their new book 
and about the state of the universities 

8
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:55,551
and I suppose society at large.
So thanks guys very much for joining me 

9
00:00:55,551 --> 00:01:00,531
today.
So I thought maybe we'd start talking 

10
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:04,701
about the book.
So do you guys want to provide some 

11
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,831
background?
Maybe you could talk about the Atlantic 

12
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,921
monthly essay and what led up to the 
book and then we'll get into the 

13
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:09,921
details.
Sure.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,800
It all started in 2007 when I was lucky 
enough to have a full on medical level 

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,680
of depression.
Really,

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,760
really bad.
I talk about it in some sort of detail 

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,760
in the,
uh,

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,731
in the book I realized it's actually a 
level at which I realized I wrote about 

19
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,460
it with details that my wife doesn't 
know.

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,210
There's a weird privacy thing that 
sometimes happens when you're dictating 

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,070
into a computer.
This is just between me and the computer

22
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,840
and now I realize it's probably the most
public thing,

23
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,370
but the thing that saved me,
the thing that ultimately helped me deal

24
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,220
with my depression general,
well as cognitive behavioral therapy,

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,350
um,
in a sense it's sort of like applied 

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,560
stoicism.
You just look at your own thoughts.

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,260
You talked back to the really 
exaggerated ones.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,320
You've labeled them as cognitive 
distortions that these include things 

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,220
like generalization,
catastrophizing,

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,600
binary thinking,
thinking,

31
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,370
everything has to be there,
all good or bad.

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,080
I'm actually particularly guilty of 
these.

33
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,490
And Amazingly,
if you just actually learned what these 

34
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,351
distortions are and practice everyday to
sort of talk back to sort of the more 

35
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,530
anxious or depressed voices in your own 
head.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,530
It's an incredibly effective treatment 
for depression and anxiety.

37
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,090
And it changed,
absolutely changed my life.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,730
Meanwhile,
as this is changing my life,

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm still working,
I'm still the president of fire,

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,750
which means I defend free speech and due
process and academic freedom on campus.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,320
And um,
while I was learning all of these 

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,790
intellectual habits,
all of these ways to sort of talk 

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,951
yourself down,
I was looking around at what 

44
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:42,110
administrators we're doing and an ask 
and saying to myself,

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,140
wow,
it's actually kind of like the 

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,140
administrators are saying,
oh,

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,570
by the way,
you do engage in cognitive distortions,

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,840
do engage in binary thinking,
do overgeneralize and most of all 

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,450
catastrophize all the time.

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,360
And I remember thinking something to the
effect of,

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,930
well thank goodness the students don't 
seem to really be buying it.

52
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,120
And that's what changed in 2013,
2014 prior to 2013,

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,210
2014 since I started in 2001,
the worst constituency for free speech 

54
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,160
on campus was actually administrators.
The best,

55
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:17,161
most reliable fans of free speech you 
could run into on campus were generally 

56
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,970
the students themselves.
And then sometime around 2013,

57
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,840
2014,
we saw a.

58
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,700
suddenly they were demanding everything 
from trigger warnings to microaggression

59
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,670
policies to December stations for even 
people,

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
but,
but both on the left and the right on 

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,060
the spectrum and it seemed like we said 
it seemed to happen almost overnight and

62
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,080
this,
uh,

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,650
and when I went to talk to John about 
it,

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,700
we'd become friends through a mutual 
friend and I said,

65
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
it's almost that I talked about my whole
theory that we're teaching a generation 

66
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,370
the habits of anxious and depressed 
people from cognitive behavioral 

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,450
therapy.
John got really excited about the idea,

68
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,520
um,
and asked if I wanted to write about it.

69
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,440
And I was already a fan of John's work.
So I was like,

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,160
absolutely.

71
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,430
Yeah.
So I thought that his insight into what 

72
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,850
had changed was absolutely brilliant.
Uh,

73
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,320
I had just begun to notice this in my 
own teaching.

74
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,560
I've been teaching since 1995 at the 
University of Virginia originally and it

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,880
was seemingly overnight,
right around 2014.

76
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,290
These new ideas,
you know,

77
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,410
students of course are political.
They protest,

78
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,200
they object to things,
but what was new Grad?

79
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,210
Put his finger on it.
What was new was the idea that these 

80
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:25,210
words are going to harm me,
not just defend me,

81
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,080
not just be unjust,
harm me.

82
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:32,081
We have to protect.
It was this idea that students are 

83
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,571
fragile and need protection and the 
protection should come from 

84
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:34,640
administrators,
from adults.

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,470
That's what was new and disturbing.

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,710
Yeah.
Will you guys talk in the book about 

87
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,470
concept creep and the overgeneralization
of the idea of trauma and you know,

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,080
one of the things that's really struck 
me as interesting about the safe space 

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,920
movement and the microaggression 
policies and all of that is that it does

90
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:58,921
run so contrary to what every clinician 
worth his or her salt knows about 

91
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:03,361
treating anxiety or depression and it 
one so.

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,450
So that's kind of a remarkable.
A phenomenon in itself is that what we 

93
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,381
know clinically has been absolutely 
inverted by people who are 

94
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,530
hypothetically agitating on the part of 
students' mental health.

95
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:19,531
And it's not as if the mental health 
community has stood up on moss and 

96
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,450
denounced this.
So.

97
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,910
And I also don't.
I don't understand that.

98
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,911
I also don't understand how we got here.
You guys talk in the book a little bit 

99
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:33,781
about your little bit of,
you hypothesize a little bit about the 

100
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,080
internet generation.
Right?

101
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:40,081
And those are the kids born after 1995.
You don't put the finger on the 

102
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:43,591
millennials but.
But let's talk a little bit about why 

103
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:46,360
you think things changed in 2013 and 
2014.

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,220
Let me just first say your point about 
this whole,

105
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,620
these whole,
these new ideas are not clinically 

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,620
supported.
Something that we suggest in the book.

107
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,510
We know,
we don't know if this is going on.

108
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,170
To what extent is this a sincere desire 
for protection and a sincere belief that

109
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:10,361
students are fragile and to what extent 
is it the pursuing of a political agenda

110
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:10,810
and,
and,

111
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:14,300
and making political points and using 
mental health as a cover.

112
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,770
I think both are operative and and so,
and it may depend on the context.

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,310
Why do you think the first one is 
operative?

114
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,370
Because this runs so contrary to 
everything that's known about the actual

115
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:33,371
protection of mental health.
I'm very skeptical about attributing a 

116
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,110
positive motivation to it.
Like,

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
it seems to me that it's fundamentally 
driven by resentment.

118
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,040
Well,
it's

119
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,090
so,
uh,

120
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,760
so you're absolutely right that the 
psychological community does not support

121
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,880
this,
but yet has not stood up very vocally to

122
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,420
condemn it.
So we are hopeful that psychologists and

123
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,570
psychiatrists,
everyone we spoke to,

124
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,910
agreed that ends over only exactly the 
worst thing to do for someone who 

125
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:04,590
suffers from ptsd is to sweep clean 
their daily life of reminders,

126
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,470
thereby denying them the chance to 
situate,

127
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,620
to decondition the,
uh,

128
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,730
the power of these quotes triggers in 
the real world.

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,040
It's worse in some sense too because one
of the things you do when you expose 

130
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:26,171
people who have anxiety disorders to the
things that are anxious about is not 

131
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:28,400
make them less anxious,
but make them more courageous.

132
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Right?
And that's why it generalizes because 

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,401
the psychoanalysts thought that exposure
would just mean the fears would pop up 

134
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:36,890
somewhere else,
but they don't.

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,070
And it's because people learn that 
there's more to them than they thought.

136
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:43,700
And then when you protect them,
not only do not expose them,

137
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,270
which is a big problem,
but you also teach them to generalize.

138
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:52,271
The idea of their weakness,
which is a really terrible thing to do 

139
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,070
to people so you couldn't invent more 
counterproductive mental health movement

140
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:58,130
and instituted on campus is if you set 
out to design it.

141
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,060
That's something that we always try to 
emphasize.

142
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,310
So interesting for us to look at was the
one thing,

143
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,720
because,
you know,

144
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,190
the third anti free speech movement is 
coming from students,

145
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,050
uh,
in the relatively recent past,

146
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,000
so late eighties and early nineties for 
example.

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,070
But the thing that was so striking was 
that they were medicalizing all,

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,280
all of these claims,
you know,

149
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,490
of course I'm sitting there going like,
that doesn't sound right.

150
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,260
And I talked to John and he was like,
I haven't sound right.

151
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,820
And we interviewed for the original 
article,

152
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:27,780
maybe seven different clinical 
psychologists,

153
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:28,940
cbt experts,
uh,

154
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,920
you know,
for example.

155
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,620
And the thing I keep on trying keep on 
explaining it as it's,

156
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,630
as a fraternity up what could be a minor
version into something more like a 

157
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,750
phobia because we're giving it so much 
more power.

158
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,820
And the worst thing of all that we're 
doing,

159
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,220
so much of our campuses,
we're turning it into a Schema.

160
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,970
We're turning the idea that I've,
that I'm broken into,

161
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,900
um,
into,

162
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,630
uh,
a permanent sort of self definition.

163
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,980
So that's why I do think that there's 
sort of a mixed motive thing going

164
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
on here.
I think that we have a self fulfilling 

165
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,021
prophecy going on to some degree because
I do think that some of this kind of 

166
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:06,531
hopeless ideology is actually genuinely 
Harvard students actually making them 

167
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:10,481
more anxious and depressed.
And of course it's really incompatible 

168
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:10,481
with

169
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,650
statistics to that end.
So one of the things you guys 

170
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,621
concentrate on the book is,
is statistics indicating that there has 

171
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,690
in fact been there is evidence of a 
decline in mental health over the last.

172
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,430
What is it about the last decade

173
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,970
since around 22,000?
Nine to 2012 is when the elbow,

174
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,220
that's where things begin to,
to arch up.

175
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:36,630
And then they go steadily up to about 
2015,

176
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,710
2016.
We don't know if they're still going up 

177
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,381
or if they're plateauing,
but this is what's going into a little 

178
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,350
bit of detail because it was just an 
article in the New York Times.

179
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,010
Richard Friedman psychiatrist wrote an 
article,

180
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,660
something about how the idea of a wave 
of increased anxiety is a myth.

181
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,110
He said,
he said it's just based on one or two,

182
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:56,680
you know,
there've been some,

183
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:59,830
a couple of self report studies in which
students say that they're more anxious.

184
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,020
And he dismissed that and said,
don't worry America,

185
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:07,021
you kids aren't becoming more anxious.
So we thought we dug into this in 

186
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,830
detail.
We did not want to catastrophize.

187
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:12,670
We did not want to foment a moral panic.
So we didn't want to say,

188
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,840
you know,
oh my God,

189
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:14,620
the sky is falling.

190
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,440
Kids are,
are,

191
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:18,190
are depressed and anxious.
So we looked into this in great detail.

192
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,990
Uh,
and we were.

193
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,440
So we were looking for this data in our 
art Atlantic article and it wasn't 

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,480
there.
Uh,

195
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,510
that is the anecdotes everywhere.
People were saying the mental health 

196
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,381
centers are swamped.
So there were plenty of reports from 

197
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,391
mental health centers,
but isn't this just because kids these 

198
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,090
days are more comfortable seeking 
treatment.

199
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:38,630
That's why the mental health centers is 
swap.

200
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,490
Maybe there's no real increase.
So in Atlantic article we could not make

201
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,230
a strong case and we left it very 
speculative,

202
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,900
but just two years later,
uh,

203
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,860
when Jean [inaudible] book came out,
I aged and she brought in data from,

204
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:55,861
for national nationally representative 
surveys showing that it really is an 

205
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,040
increased out.
Again,

206
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,400
those were almost all self report.
What convinced us,

207
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,580
but convince us that it's real is that 
there was a,

208
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:07,120
there was a major study done published 
in Jama,

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,220
Journal of American Medical Association 
looking at hospital admission data.

210
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,550
So they broke it down by gender and you 
always have to look male,

211
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:13,220
female,
separate.

212
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,080
They broke it down by sex and by age 
group within teenagers and for all of 

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,860
the age groups,
for four of the girls,

214
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:25,150
teenage girls hospital admissions for 
cell part from cutting yourself,

215
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,880
taking voice.
This is nonfatal.

216
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,720
Um,
it's flat,

217
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,410
flat,
flat.

218
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,060
And then right around 2011,
2012,

219
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,070
2013,
he starts going up and up and up,

220
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,230
and of course the rate is lowest for 11 
to 13 year old girl.

221
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:41,231
So let's let the do this.
But the increase was the largest and 20 

222
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:45,541
says that social media is social 
comparison seems to be hardest on the 

223
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:50,161
youngest girls.
So the self harm data confirms this is 

224
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:50,860
behavioral data.
This is not self report.

225
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,140
Uh,
and then the real kicker,

226
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,470
it's suicide.
If you look at the suicide statistics,

227
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,220
they showed the same pattern as the self
report of depression data,

228
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,690
which is,
um,

229
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,970
if you look at the first decade of the 
century,

230
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,070
so 2000,
one to two to 2010,

231
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,430
the average,
a number of kids who killed themselves 

232
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,560
successfully commits suicide.

233
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,410
The rate for boys from that decade,
uh,

234
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,740
through Twenty 15,
2016,

235
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,630
those two years of data,
it goes up and up and up up 25 percent,

236
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,960
which is gigantic.
There's been an enormous increase in 

237
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,980
voice suicide.
The increase for girls is 70 percent,

238
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,130
seven zero.
So boys,

239
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,430
the rate is higher for boys because 
girls make many more attempts,

240
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,310
but boys methods,
so the.

241
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,840
So the increase is actually fairly 
parallel,

242
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,420
but as a percentage is much higher for 
girls.

243
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,750
Social Media,
at least this is his argument and we 

244
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,060
think there's some validity to it.
Twenties argument is that the spread of 

245
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,420
of iphones and social media has brought 
boys into play video games.

246
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,420
They play a lot of video games,
but those aren't actually that harmful.

247
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,020
It's the social comparison sites.
It's a instagram and and other things 

248
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,781
where girls are comparing their lives to
other girls and feeling left out that we

249
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:12,241
think we don't know for sure,
but that we think is the most powerful 

250
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:12,590
reason why the girls rates have 
increased so much.

251
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,080
Oh sorry.
John Greenberg.

252
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,790
That data too,
because even since 2007,

253
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,830
if you just pick 2007,
we're talking about a doubling in terms 

254
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,050
of suicide in 2007.
That was the.

255
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,030
That was the lowest year.
So if you just.

256
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,790
So it's,
that's why it's best to not take 2007.

257
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,690
It's best to just take the average 
bounces around.

258
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,080
No trend in the first decade.

259
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Okay.
So we could hypothesize perhaps that 

260
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,110
there's something approximating a 
positive feedback loop going on here.

261
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,200
So imagine because I'm trying to figure 
out why things have gone out of control,

262
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,390
say since 2013,
it's like there's been a tipping point.

263
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,230
And so I'm going to offer a few ideas 
and you guys can tell me what you think.

264
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,940
Okay.
So let's,

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
let's think of four or five reasons.
So I think there's an increase in 

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,501
political perceived political 
polarization and maybe real political 

267
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,320
polarization because the mainstream 
media,

268
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,220
mainstream media is dying and as it dies
it gets,

269
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,810
it gets more attracted to quick bait 
journalism and exaggerates the degree of

270
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:16,811
extremism on both sides.
And that's a consequence of a 

271
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:20,201
technological revolution that the threat
that they're under from probably from 

272
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,970
Internet media sources.
So that's one.

273
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,490
The next one would be the UN.
I'm opposed,

274
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:33,491
rise of the postmodern Marxist doctrines
that characterize disciplines,

275
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,450
particularly like women's studies.

276
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,250
Now you guys talked about a woman who 
generated,

277
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,040
um,
intersectionality theory,

278
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,070
Kimberle crenshaw,
and I'd been looking into Kate Millett 

279
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,990
who established patriarchy theory or one
of the people who established it and she

280
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,260
was a radical lesbian for political 
reasons and had an alcoholic and abusive

281
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:01,571
father.
So I think that's quite interesting and 

282
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,190
I think that these theories,
crenshaw and,

283
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,190
and millets theories were basically 
ignored by serious scholars in the,

284
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,460
in the academic world,
but they've spread and have had a 

285
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:17,801
disproportionate effect on the 
universities and their combined with a 

286
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,540
kind of Marxist viewpoints that divides 
the world into victimizer and victim.

287
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,130
And then maybe we have the,
what you just said.

288
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,320
Yep.
You Bet.

289
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,180
On the political polarization.
Absolutely.

290
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:36,181
We have a whole chapter on that.
The way to think about this as 

291
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:39,371
universities are complicated 
institutions nested within a broader 

292
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,430
society and they're changing and the 
broader society has changed.

293
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,440
And so we document how the rise in 
political polarization and here the 

294
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,280
thing to focus on is not polarization of
attitudes about abortion or things like 

295
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,211
that is how much do you hate the other 
side that has been going up steadily 

296
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:57,460
since the 19 nineties.
And so if you have a left right battle,

297
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:02,461
it's getting more and more intense at 
the same time as the professoriate is 

298
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,480
going from leaning left to being much 
further on the left.

299
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:07,110
So we document this in the book,
um,

300
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,720
that the,
the overall left right ratio for a 

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:12,720
variety of reasons went from a two to 
two,

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,940
one overall putting everybody to,
to one of the early nineties,

303
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,500
two,
five to one left,

304
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:22,501
right ratio by 2010.
So if you have a more politically 

305
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:26,071
purified institution at a time when the 
electromagnetic forces of crossbars and 

306
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,180
hatred are ginning up,
then yes,

307
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,390
you have a more politicized institution.
So there's a lot going on there.

308
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,450
It's not unique to the left.
It just so happens that universities 

309
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:36,640
have been polarizing,
left other institutions,

310
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,350
polarized,
right?

311
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,780
If you believe in diversity,
if you believe that diversity makes 

312
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,591
people think better because it 
challenges thoughts in a loss of 

313
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,090
political diversity is harmful and it's 
a contributor,

314
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,930
echo chambers that we agreed on the 
Internet.

315
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Social media does go to pat you on the 
back for having those thick of an echo 

316
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:54,980
chamber as possible.
Um,

317
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm definitely a big proponent of sort 
of the big sort of hypothesis certainly 

318
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,650
lived this experience that we 
increasingly live in a politically 

319
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,060
homogeneous communities now.
Big Sort of course talks about us living

320
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,250
in more politically homogeneous 
counties,

321
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:12,000
but Charles Murray and others have done 
research about how we actually live even

322
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:17,001
more politically homogeneous city blocks
that actually we are sort of self 

323
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,820
sorting.
Tyler Cowen talks about this too,

324
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:23,090
and of course if you have sort of a 
social circle where you practically 

325
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,220
never run into anybody who disagrees 
with you.

326
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,570
The,
all the different sort of tribalism 

327
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,891
experiments that they've done,
polarization experiments they've done 

328
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,640
over the years shows that you attend to 
sort of spiral off into the distance.

329
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,200
So that's one of the reasons why I think
of,

330
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,660
this is what we call him the book of 
problem with progress,

331
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,780
but if you think about the idea that we 
can live in communities that reflect our

332
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:43,740
values going back around late 19 
seventies,

333
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,460
that sounds lovely.
That sounds great,

334
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,610
Ray,
to live in communities for my values,

335
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,790
but if you've ever lived in a,
that reflects just one political point 

336
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,911
of view and virtually none of the other.
It does have a tendency to become a 

337
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:59,870
virtue signal,
a contest more than an actual place 

338
00:17:59,870 --> 00:17:59,870
where you discuss ideas.

339
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,250
Okay.
So now let's move on to the services of 

340
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,250
Marxism.
Um,

341
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,620
so I think you and I both agree that 
that postmodernism Marxism,

342
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,060
uh,
that these are lenses that tend to 

343
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,060
amplify conflict.
These are somehow involved.

344
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,710
Uh,
I think you and I may disagree a bit on 

345
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,710
the dynamics here and the extent of it.
So I'll just leave it.

346
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,660
The way that I think about it,
these ideas,

347
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:24,560
this way of looking at things,
even these ideas of of trigger warnings,

348
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:29,561
matrices of oppression,
those ideas existed in feminist circles 

349
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,891
going all the way back to the nineties 
as a professor at Nyu and previous that 

350
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:37,751
Uva,
I have not seen that postmodernism or 

351
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,490
Marxism or in any way spreading across 
the disciplines.

352
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,110
They've always been there in a few 
disciplines.

353
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,500
There's a lot of of Marxist analysis and
sociology.

354
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,770
I have not noticed that spreading at all
among the professoriate or across 

355
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:50,770
disciplines.

356
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,510
I think what has happened is that social
media and the Internet,

357
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:58,511
especially social media has knocked down
the compartments a good society needs a 

358
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,800
lot of compartments,
needs a lot of walls,

359
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:05,801
were different norms and different 
practices flourish that you can do 

360
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,700
different jobs.
I think social media is knocked down the

361
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:12,701
walls so that certain ideas that maybe 
some students get from their gender 

362
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,150
studies or anthropology or sociology 
classes,

363
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,140
those ideas can spread among the 
students and they're often not even 

364
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,110
really the accurate ideas.
That's a sort of a bastardized version,

365
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,460
a modified in ways that I don't really 
even understand that can spread around.

366
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,730
This is how you can get bad 
psychological ideas that political ideas

367
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,390
spreading around among the students.
That's what's been most striking to us 

368
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,430
is that this is really the change is 
really student led.

369
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:42,431
It's a generational thing.
You can blame faculty and in certain 

370
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,631
departments for.
You can certainly disagree with their 

371
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,631
ideas,
but it's not that there's this 

372
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:48,631
conspiracy as far as we can tell a 
conspiracy,

373
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,690
one of the professors to take over.
Maybe you'll disagree with that.

374
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,820
We see it.
I see it as more student led.

375
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,170
I didn't want to talk a lot about John 
and I talk a lot about,

376
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,150
but it didn't quite make it into the 
book.

377
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,100
What we've dubbed it is the fortress.
And what we mean by that is if you look 

378
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:05,940
at the way,
like I,

379
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,950
I went to Stanford for law school,
I worked for the Eclu of Northern 

380
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,950
California.
Um,

381
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,600
and I saw this sort of happening even in
the early nineties that one of the 

382
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,710
things that some of these postmodern 
theories,

383
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:20,711
particularly privileged theory allow is 
a matter of arguing in which you never 

384
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,540
ever have to get to the substance of the
argument.

385
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,750
So even in the late nineties,
reformable borders had a lot of levels 

386
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,351
of protection.
You didn't have to listen to anybody if 

387
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:32,351
they're conservative was almost taken 
for granted,

388
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:34,460
which I deeply ashamed of.
Um,

389
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,830
you didn't have to,
uh,

390
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,330
and now if you add to it,
you don't have to listen to anybody.

391
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:43,331
If they have privilege.
And by the way 100 percent of people 

392
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:46,151
actually do,
that means you can choose to listen to 

393
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:48,060
whomever the hell you want because it's 
only optional.

394
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,780
You have an option to either dismiss 
marks a as being a white privileged male

395
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:57,781
or you can listen to them.
But anytime you run into someone who 

396
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,541
disagrees with you,
you have several sort of tools at your 

397
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:00,541
disposal.

398
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,790
The was that were white males defending 
our privileged.

399
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,310
Almost nobody engaged with the substance
of the argument.

400
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah,
boiled down to the power claims of 

401
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:22,650
competing identity groups.
Then there is no such thing as substance

402
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,010
and I think that actually fits quite 
nicely with certain strains of 

403
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,071
postmodern thinking that have a tendency
to deny any knowledge of any real world 

404
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:35,550
and to presume that everything is not 
only interpretation interpretation based

405
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:40,551
on a power claims for competing groups 
and the intersectionality theory.

406
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:45,981
You know,
I just finished writing the preface to 

407
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:47,640
that new version of the Fiftieth 
Anniversary version of the Gulag.

408
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:52,641
Archipelago was quite something and I 
was trying to synthesize Solzhenitsyn's 

409
00:21:55,861 --> 00:22:00,861
arguments about why the Russian 
revolution went so badly south 

410
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,950
immediately after it began.
And it's very interesting to think about

411
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:09,951
it from this intersectionality 
perspective because as you guys just 

412
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:13,971
pointed out,
it's not an unreasonable proposition 

413
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,110
that people have multiple,
multiple group identities.

414
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Now.
Perhaps there's some use in considering 

415
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,461
that because you can think of the ways 
that people have different advantages 

416
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:29,181
and disadvantages,
but one of the real pernicious side 

417
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,411
effects of that kind of thinking,
especially when it's conjoined with a 

418
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:36,090
viewpoint that divides the world into 
victim and victimizer,

419
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:41,091
is that you can take any one person and 
maybe generate 20 group identities for 

420
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:46,671
them and you can find at least one 
identity along which they're privileged 

421
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:50,450
and that means that not only can you 
ignore them as a consequence of them 

422
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,751
speaking only on behalf of their power,
but you have a valid reason for 

423
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:58,011
persecuting them,
and that's exactly what happened in the 

424
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:58,011
Soviet Union.

425
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,850
As long as I could find one dimension 
along which you were an oppressor,

426
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,440
then you were done.

427
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,630
Yeah,

428
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,790
right.
Right.

429
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,620
Well,
they were the best example of that.

430
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,590
Any other countries where search.
That's where my family comes from and in

431
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:16,580
any other country,
you know,

432
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:21,581
my family's story would have been 
because we went from being to being 

433
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:21,770
lawyers and judges within a single 
generation.

434
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,490
My grandfather was in Kiev,
polytechnic studying to be a professor 

435
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,470
when World War One broke out and of 
course people like me,

436
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,160
success stories and any other country we
were shot in the back of the head by the

437
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:34,550
millions.

438
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,730
Right,
right.

439
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:40,731
Well,
and you were actually the working class 

440
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:40,731
success stories because when,
when was,

441
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:42,330
when was eradicated in,
in,

442
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,280
in Russia.
Right,

443
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,260
right.
So people

444
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,490
were basically slaves up to that point 
and some people made very rapid,

445
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,920
uh,
leaps in status within a single 

446
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,161
generation or two.
And those were the Kulaks that were 

447
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,100
medicated by the,
by the Soviets after World War One.

448
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,450
Then that,
of course,

449
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:04,860
that's what led to the huge starvation 
and massive starvation of the 19,

450
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,810
late 1920 [inaudible] and 1930 
[inaudible] and early 19 thirties.

451
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,650
So it was a complete catastrophe.
So.

452
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,360
Alright.
So we,

453
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,910
you put together a bunch of symptoms,
you know,

454
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,860
you said well,
microaggression theory,

455
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,130
I'm no admirer of Daryl is derald wing 
sue?

456
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,250
Yes.
I think that,

457
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,220
that.
I read his book,

458
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:26,950
I thought it was absolutely appalling.
And in all in all possible manners.

459
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,340
There's the,
the kind of oppression theory and 

460
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,991
intersectionality,
the idea that we're in a patriarchal 

461
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,931
tyranny,
and then one of the things that you've 

462
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:42,041
pointed out at the beginning of this 
interview was the unknown effect of 

463
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:46,120
social comparison with these new social 
technologies,

464
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:47,850
social media technologies,
right?

465
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:52,851
Because we're really at a really laid 
vulnerable to these new technologies 

466
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,230
because we have no idea what the effect 
they have on adults,

467
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,300
let alone young people.
And so do you think that is actually 

468
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,911
making young people feel that the world 
is a more dangerous place and requiring 

469
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,300
them to seek protection?

470
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,360
Oh yes.
We think that's a big part of it.

471
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,710
Physical Safety,
safe or unsafe for death rates go down 

472
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,250
so you know Steve Pinker and many 
others,

473
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:24,251
a chronicle of the decline of violence,
but we react to the world not as it is.

474
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:28,050
We react to the world as we perceive it 
through the filters that were given.

475
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,740
And if,
if you remember the old movie from the 

476
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,370
19 eighties or nineties,
it was the bowling for columbine boy,

477
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,200
Michael Moore's movie,
bowling for Columbine,

478
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,650
where he traces out why Americans are so
paranoid compared to Canadian,

479
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,160
I'd say.
And he,

480
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,230
he blames it all on cable TV,
putting stories of crime in our face.

481
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,610
All right?
So I think there's a lot of truth to 

482
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:53,610
that.
Now,

483
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,720
imagine social media channeling not just
stories of crime,

484
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,450
but whichever side you're on 
politically,

485
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,600
you now get filtered through of all of 
the stupid things that any person says 

486
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,780
in our country of 330 million people 
everyday.

487
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,040
Someone on the left says something 
incredibly stupid and offensive.

488
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,250
And everyday some of the rights says 
something you know,

489
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,110
and as a video.
And so if you're being.

490
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,490
So if you're rewarded for forwarding 
outrage,

491
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,690
things that outrage you aside,
you're rewarded for forwarding them at 

492
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:23,690
home.
We're all forwarding it.

493
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,850
We're all drowning in outrage stories.
And one of the things that that sells or

494
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:32,851
that sells in terms of getting retweets 
is stories of aggression or violence or 

495
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,410
racism or whatever it is.
People trampling on your side,

496
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:38,440
sacred values.
So if you're exposed constantly,

497
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,000
the stories of you know,
if you're,

498
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,960
if you're on the left,
you're exposed to stories of right not,

499
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,220
not season.
You think that half the country is,

500
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,580
this is going to have a big effect on 
your perceptions,

501
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,090
even if even if the reality is social 
progress,

502
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,680
even if the reality is increasing 
safety.

503
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,490
So we do think that the reason why it's 
so many things are going haywire,

504
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,520
not just in America but in many 
countries is the Internet and social 

505
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,970
media all hitting us.
At the same time,

506
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,340
globalization is the other factor,
a little more distant,

507
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,820
but I think their intersection 
intersecting interacting in all kinds of

508
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,010
interesting ways that we don't yet 
understand.

509
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,170
We talked about polarization on the 
right than on the left.

510
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,190
And one of the things that struck me and
maybe I'm wrong about this,

511
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:26,191
is that I'd be particularly concerned 
about the rise of the radical left.

512
00:27:26,621 --> 00:27:31,390
And that's probably because I've been 
immersed in the University of you and as

513
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:36,391
you already pointed out,
the left is overrepresented at least 

514
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:40,321
among the social scientists and the 
humanities and I suspect as well the 

515
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:44,251
administration in the universities and 
then I see as well people being 

516
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,670
concerned about the rise of the radical 
right.

517
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,880
But I certainly don't see the radical 
right as posing a threat in the 

518
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,701
universities and I can't see what sort 
of threat the radical right is posing 

519
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,250
because I can't get numbers.
So like when,

520
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
there are lots of stories about outright
types and about neo Nazis and white 

521
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,070
supremacists,
but they seem,

522
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,130
I mean there was a white supremacist 
rally in Washington about a month and a 

523
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,570
half ago and I think they got 16 people 
on a bus on the white supremacists side 

524
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,221
and several thousand counter protesters.
And so I'm wondering to what degree the 

525
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:19,840
radical right is,
uh,

526
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,510
like I don't know where they are 
exactly.

527
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,700
So do you have thoughts about that?

528
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:25,770
Yeah,
definitely.

529
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,060
In my work,
I talk about this being the most recent 

530
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,761
trend and we talk about this in the book
and it's not necessarily the radical 

531
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:36,600
right,
but we've seen some of the talk about it

532
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,670
kind of like we have this sort of echo 
chamber on the universities and there is

533
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:45,671
a sort of an echo chamber on the right 
as well and those two have been a sort 

534
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:46,220
of colliding with each other with each 
other.

535
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,460
So we've definitely seen an uptick in 
fire of liberal professors getting in 

536
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,720
trouble for what they say on the 
Internet,

537
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,290
what they say on twitter or facebook or 
you know,

538
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,600
going on Fox News for example.
And we talk about a couple of examples 

539
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,351
of that in the book.
Now this is so recent that we're not 

540
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:06,410
going to have real data on it,
but it definitely is a noticeable change

541
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,770
for those of us who work on the front 
line.

542
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,930
So it's important to look at the timing 
here because we hear this a lot too.

543
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:13,190
And you know,
whenever we talk about something,

544
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:14,270
people will find out,
well,

545
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,230
what about the.
All right,

546
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,120
and what about the Nazis?
Um,

547
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,340
and when,
when we started this,

548
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,930
when Greg first notice what was going on
in 2013,

549
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,280
2014 and in our article came out in 
2015,

550
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,590
the right had nothing to do with it now 
that nobody had heard of the alt right 

551
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,740
practically they weren't trolling on 
campus.

552
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,200
So whenever the origins of the problem 
on campus,

553
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:36,680
it is not a reaction to the right now in
2016,

554
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,220
um,
the right got a lot more attention and 

555
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,670
it got much more sophisticated trolling.
And uh,

556
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,460
as I read a little bit about trolling or
the New York Times began to cover it,

557
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,790
it became really clear all you need is a
few people with a kind of a perverse 

558
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:55,540
sense of humor and a few anonymous 
Internet accounts and they can provoke a

559
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,720
gigantic reaction from the group that 
they want to provoke.

560
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,530
And so I think in 2016 we saw the right 
and into 2017,

561
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,520
that's where we start actually seeing 
the cases of right wing movements to get

562
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:11,521
professors fired there.
There's some really nasty stuff coming 

563
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:16,261
out of various sites on the right 
flooding people's inboxes with rape 

564
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:17,850
threats.
And death threats and racist rants.

565
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:22,851
So there's a lot of nasty stuff coming 
from the right towards professors in 

566
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:26,641
2017.
And since then it wasn't happening as 

567
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:26,641
far as,
it wasn't anything new,

568
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,420
it wasn't really part of the story early
on.

569
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,530
So we've talked to six.
The polarization cycle of the problem we

570
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,950
believe is not originally from,
from the right,

571
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,620
although now they are a part of the 
polarization cycle

572
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,990
right out of the darkness in that 
manner.

573
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I mean,
one of the things I've seen on youtube 

574
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,740
and the other commentary sources that 
I've be monitoring is a real increase in

575
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:57,120
antisemitic comments and it's hard to 
tell.

576
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,190
Of course,
it's hard to quantify that,

577
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,550
but your appallingly common,
um,

578
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,670
on,
on youtube and on twitter as well.

579
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,310
Um,
and some of them are coded,

580
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:13,311
you know,
I think it's common place nowadays to 

581
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:15,430
put your comment in three brackets which
indicates a,

582
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,870
an antisemitic origin or emphasis.
And so that's very pernicious.

583
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,360
But again,
we have no idea how many people are 

584
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,640
actually engaging in this.
And it's a very difficult thing to,

585
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,240
to come to terms with.
Because like when I look at the United 

586
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,240
States,
I think,

587
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,640
and more power to you that your 
political dialogue is actually quite 

588
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,211
balanced.
There's a fair bit of power on the left 

589
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:41,211
and there's a fair bit of power on the 
right.

590
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:45,700
Um,
the radical left seems to be 

591
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,780
overrepresented in universities and 
that's something that's unique.

592
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,700
I can't get a handle on the white 
supremacists and Nazi types.

593
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,890
I mean,
I think Nazis are vanishingly rare.

594
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,400
I really believe that the white 
supremacists types as well,

595
00:31:56,401 --> 00:32:01,401
but,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that 

596
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:01,950
it's not growing.
It isn't being cultivated in some sense.

597
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,950
Then the question is how much should we 
react to it?

598
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,360
So I'm Jewish.
My mother told me when I was growing up 

599
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,470
that America is the promised land for 
the Jews.

600
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,230
It's not Israel.
Israel is the promised land.

601
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,810
Um,
I was raised to believe that America is 

602
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:20,810
the promised land for the Jews.
Sure.

603
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,380
There was some antisemitism.
My parents,

604
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,060
we moved to Scarsdale,
New York,

605
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,400
and they could not join certain country 
clubs.

606
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,480
Big Deal.
There were Jewish clubs,

607
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,530
there were clubs.
That's the way things were.

608
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,000
It was,
it wasn't perfect,

609
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:34,160
but compared to what?
Compared to the rest of the world,

610
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,970
God,
my grandparents got off the boat in New 

611
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:39,970
York and didn't go onto Buenos Aires or 
any,

612
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,530
any place else that was settled 
originally by the Spanish.

613
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Um,
so America is not an antisemitic 

614
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:47,780
country.
Now.

615
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,760
What do we make of the fact that now 
we're seeing all this antisemitic stuff.

616
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:55,210
What I make of it is that there are a 
few assholes who are organizing and 

617
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,571
doing this and am I triggered by it 
because I grew up where occasionally you

618
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,710
come across a swastika,
like scratched into the bathroom stall.

619
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,470
You'd find the f word,
you'd find them Saturdays,

620
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,200
you'd find a drawing of a penis and 
you'd see a swastika.

621
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,890
And my reaction was,
you know,

622
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,180
Yuck or bad.
And then I would go on with my day.

623
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,110
It wasn't a trigger.
But if we teach kids now,

624
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,200
if you find something on the Internet,
been triggered and of course you will 

625
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,200
always find something on the Internet.

626
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,530
I will say though,
and this is just anecdotal,

627
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:28,690
but my.
I speak a lot of times in California and

628
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,720
some of the sort of anti Israel bleeding
into antisemitism is something that 

629
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,100
I've,
I've,

630
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,860
I've seen really dramatic performance.
It's almost as if it's become stylish to

631
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:41,560
be so anti.
You're almost antisemitic.

632
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:46,561
At least certain circles.
And I spoke at the British Labor Party 

633
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:46,830
for example.
For example,

634
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,480
I spoke at the 50th anniversary of the 
start of the free speech movement way 

635
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,480
back in 2014.
Uh,

636
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,290
I spoke at Berkeley and I'll be damned 
if my speech was not in a room with a 

637
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:02,611
lot of antisemites and there was even a 
guy who was trying to address this 

638
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:02,611
saying like,
oh,

639
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:04,150
and people want to call it antisemitic 
and so wrong,

640
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:07,980
and then you finish that sentence.
But it's undeniable that the poison hand

641
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,240
of Zionism destroys everything it 
touches.

642
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:11,890
And I was like,
okay,

643
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,950
that's,
that's A.

644
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,480
I think they,
I can understand wanting to call you 

645
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,480
that.
So I,

646
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,880
I definitely,
I don't think it's in people's heads 

647
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,440
that this is real and I've noticed it 
most pronounced for some reason in 

648
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:24,940
California.

649
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,210
Okay.
So here's the idea of.

650
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,380
So no,
one of the things that happened in 

651
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,110
Germany in the 19 twenties was a 
polarization process,

652
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,160
right?
I'm obviously much more severe than the 

653
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,801
one that we're going through,
but I wonder if when the political 

654
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:48,451
spectrum polarizes that I'm 
ethnocentrism of a certain sort of rises

655
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:53,761
and drive something like antisemitism.
So maybe maybe when the left and the 

656
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:59,341
right are relatively close together,
people aren't so obsessed with their 

657
00:34:59,341 --> 00:34:59,620
group identities or the extreme types 
aren't.

658
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,140
But then with the polarization process 
starts,

659
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,880
everybody locks harder into the group 
identities and then anyone who's.

660
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,190
I don't know if it's anyone who's an 
outsider is viewed with access to 

661
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,430
sufficient.
But see the situation with the Jewish 

662
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,010
people is complicated too because 
they're often successful.

663
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,940
So I don't know if it's some perverse 
interaction between ethnocentrism and 

664
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,120
resentment for the,
for the successful,

665
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:30,121
that's.
It drives antisemitism during 

666
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:30,310
polarization processes.
I'm trying to get,

667
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,710
get a finger organized,
you know,

668
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,950
trying to put my finger on it.

669
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,980
I think what you're,
what you're reaching for it here is this

670
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:38,820
phenomena that you suddenly these bursts
of intolerance.

671
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:43,821
What triggers that?
And here I turned to Karen Stenner of 

672
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:44,740
political scientists,
didn't work at Princeton,

673
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:47,700
and now she lives in Australia.
She wrote this brilliant book,

674
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,250
the authoritarian dynamic published in 
2005.

675
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,690
And what she says in there is that 
authoritarianism is not a stable 

676
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,001
personality trait.
It's a dynamic in which some people got 

677
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,240
20 or 30 percent of the population,
um,

678
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,920
when they perceive that society is 
coming apart.

679
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,490
That is,
you know,

680
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,650
I study morality,
we need a sense of shared moral order or

681
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,050
at times when we feel that the moral 
order is secure,

682
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,780
violations aren't punished,
everything's fine.

683
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,170
Um,
there are other times when we feel 

684
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:22,170
things are coming apart,
it's chaos,

685
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,080
it's Babel,
when that's happening,

686
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,170
people who have this predisposition to 
authoritarianism,

687
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:31,171
it's like there's a button on their head
that gets pushed and they then become 

688
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,380
intolerant against all outsiders.

689
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,650
And so she does experiments where she 
gives a story about,

690
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,270
you know,
maybe it's Mexican immigration,

691
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,510
but it turns that that then makes know 
if you present it in a threatening way 

692
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,051
as Donald Trump does,
that doesn't just turn people against 

693
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:48,010
Mexicans.
It turns them against lgbt Americans.

694
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:51,900
So it's a general dynamic of stamp out,
descend,

695
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,970
stamp out the outsiders,
get back to the purity of our group.

696
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,290
So when we have times of increasing 
prosperity,

697
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,780
when we have peace,
when there's a sense of progress,

698
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:06,170
the pie is growing,
there is some sense that we are.

699
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,550
We have something in common,
then things get much calmer,

700
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,970
but a number of events,
a financial crisis may have contributed 

701
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,910
to sense that there is not a growing 
pie.

702
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,630
But I think again,
social media has made it so that if you 

703
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,811
are prone to this and then you sign up 
to any group that is concerned about 

704
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,730
immigration or anything else,
you will now be so you will,

705
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,850
it will be come flooding into you really
powerful videos designed to press that 

706
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,450
button over and over and over again.

707
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,150
And before you know it,
America goes from having,

708
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:39,700
you know,
50 Nazis to having 500,

709
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:41,740
maybe even 5,000.
It's not 5 million.

710
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,400
I really don't think there are five know
whatever.

711
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,360
It's not like two or three percent of 
the country are Nazis.

712
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,530
So we've got to somehow learn to get 
used to the fact that we've got to 

713
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,621
somehow get back to judging by sort of 
the average or the overall rather than 

714
00:37:55,621 --> 00:38:00,180
the individual extremes because now we 
will be faced with the individual 

715
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,620
extremes forever and also while we're 
recommending books.

716
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:05,650
Amy Chu was political tribes talks a lot
about this too and it's really,

717
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,580
really an interesting stimulating.

718
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,110
Well partly what I've been trying to do 
in my lectures.

719
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,440
So I'm lecturing to people and doing 
this to some degree on youtube as well 

720
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,300
as to emphasize the existence of the 
Coleman Center.

721
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
For me,
that's a return to classic liberal and 

722
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,930
and to some degree classic conservative 
values,

723
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,650
I mean some intermingling of those.
So some emphasis on traditional,

724
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,900
well a traditional phenomenon like a,
like monogamous marriage,

725
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:36,100
but the

726
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
idea of the sovereignty of the 
individual as part of that common 

727
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,180
landscape that unites us.
And that seems to be quite useful.

728
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,180
Although I would go ahead,

729
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,480
just keep going.
I think this is a very important point 

730
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,630
that if you go down the identitarian 
path,

731
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,980
there is no clear endpoint.
Nobody can point to where this will end 

732
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,940
in a good way.
So what's,

733
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,790
what's so interesting and here's one of 
the most encouraging signs is that just 

734
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,001
in 2018,
we are seeing an explosion of books 

735
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:12,331
written by people who are not straight 
white males who are saying identity 

736
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:14,710
politics practiced in this way is a dead
end.

737
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,260
We need to,
we need to really emphasize what we have

738
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,550
in common.
And so I'll just read you.

739
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:21,640
I just started collecting a file,
put this online someplace soon.

740
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,020
Here are some of the books.
Here's something really interesting 

741
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,020
things coming out.
Just recently,

742
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,850
Amy Schumer's book political tribes,
as Greg mentioned,

743
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,640
a Francis Fukuyama has a new book 
identity.

744
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,060
The demand for dignity and the politics 
of resentment just came out last week.

745
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,580
Uh,
Anthony Appiah isn't writing brilliantly

746
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,220
about identity politics.
Uh,

747
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,180
Jonathan Rouch,
uh,

748
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,220
I guess he's conservative,
but he's,

749
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,820
uh,
he's been writing again very,

750
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,940
uh,
about amy Chu and about other reasons 

751
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,740
why identity politics is a dead end.
John mcwhorter,

752
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,990
uh,
has been writing brilliantly about how,

753
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,200
uh,
anti racism has become a religion a how 

754
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,190
we need to start focusing on,
uh,

755
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:01,280
on that.
In that way I'm in Britain.

756
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:06,281
There are a number of,
of people of Caribbean origin had been 

757
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,721
writing about this.
I just had dinner last week with your 

758
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:09,721
shot.
Manji has a book coming up.

759
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:13,921
Don't label me.
So this is wonderful that we're seeing 

760
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:15,160
all of these people just to all of them 
identify as being on the left.

761
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,700
None of them are straight white males 
and they're all saying we need to 

762
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,390
rethink this.
And so we're,

763
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:23,260
we're thrilled because in our book and 
chapter three,

764
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,840
we distinguished between common 
humanity,

765
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:30,841
identity politics,
which is what Martin Luther King did 

766
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:30,841
have any of the civil rights leaders,
which yes,

767
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,480
you need to demand rights for groups 
that don't have them,

768
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,630
but you do it by appealing to our common
humanity versus common enemy identity 

769
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,310
politics,
which is what intersectionality tends to

770
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,020
devolve into it.

771
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:45,020
So it doesn't have to be,
but it often is bastardized into let's 

772
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,190
all unite against them.
Yeah.

773
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,150
No.
In Canada,

774
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:53,151
we've been pursuing a multicultural 
policy and our prime minister is famous 

775
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:57,591
for saying that Canada has no identity,
which I think is an absolute catastrophe

776
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,410
of an idea.
I mean,

777
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,030
if you think about the multicultural 
landscape of the planet,

778
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,630
it's certainly produces records along 
with diversity.

779
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:11,160
So the question is how do you bring 
people from different communities into a

780
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:16,340
universal community and maintain piece.
And it seems to me that you do that 

781
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,790
essentially by concentrating on the 
sovereignty of the individual as the 

782
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,271
fundamental marker for human identity 
rather than rather than the group.

783
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,370
And I was thinking about 
intersectionality,

784
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,350
which I think by the way is a painfully 
obvious idea.

785
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:38,351
You know,
the idea that you could be classified 

786
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:41,200
among many group dimensions and,
and if their social status consequences 

787
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,120
to all of those and that they interact.
Um,

788
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,500
but I think intersectionality is 
actually the discovery of the fatal flaw

789
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:52,520
of identity politics because if you drag
people down,

790
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,570
if you allow their group identities to 
multiply and interact and you get to the

791
00:41:56,571 --> 00:42:00,080
point where each individual's unique 
nexus of group identities.

792
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:05,081
And I actually think that that's what 
western culture discovered over the last

793
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,510
several thousand years,
that the logical end point is the 

794
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,851
individual.
And if you take everyone's advantages 

795
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:13,850
and disadvantages into account 
optimally,

796
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,360
then what you do is you treat them as 
individuals like there isn't any one 

797
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,631
else liked them in some sense,
except in terms of their common say 

798
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:24,410
divine value or something approximating 
that.

799
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,150
If you followed it to its logical 
conclusion,

800
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,600
then the worst aspects of identity 
arianism would vanish.

801
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:36,601
Because as you say,
everybody ultimately unfortunately of 

802
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,950
the 20 or 30 dimensions on which one 
could categorize people.

803
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,150
It's really only three to matter.
It's straight white males.

804
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,250
That's really where it's at.

805
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,750
We're digging into,
you know,

806
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:50,300
because that that's actually 
illustrative.

807
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,140
I would say to some degree of the actual
motivations.

808
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,960
There is all these identities and 
hypothetically there's nothing to 

809
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,820
distinguish them in terms of primacy,
even in terms of their effect,

810
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:04,821
say on socio economic outcome.
So then it seems to me to be a victim 

811
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:08,510
victimizer narrative that's driving the 
idea that it's straight white males,

812
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:10,040
that,
that in some sense have the,

813
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,310
have the phenomenal upper hand,
which is another thing I don't really 

814
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:15,310
buy.
I mean,

815
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,510
most of the dangerous jobs are done by 
men.

816
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,500
And so

817
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,510
who has power and wealth,
you know,

818
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:24,450
straight white man can plead guilty to 
that,

819
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:27,510
that the world is not perfectly equal 
across all categories.

820
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,080
But I think what we're seeing now in 
very sharp relief since the Sarah John 

821
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,770
Controversy in New York Times recently 
is this red wine.

822
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,500
I think it was Wednesday instead of a 
year or two ago.

823
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,790
Um,
there,

824
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,450
there are some people who see inequality
and want to end it.

825
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,410
There are other people who see 
inequality and want to reverse it.

826
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,840
At the time I thought,
well that's interesting.

827
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,900
I wonder if that's true.
But I think the Sarah John Controversy 

828
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,750
where the New York Times hired a young 
Korean American,

829
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,770
a person to join the opposite of the 
editorial page and it was discovered 

830
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:03,840
that she had all these nasty anti white 
entryway tweets.

831
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,790
And the fact that there was a discussion
and debate,

832
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,620
many people would say,
oh,

833
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:09,810
by definition there's no such thing as 
anti white racism.

834
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:11,850
It's okay to say terrible things about 
white people.

835
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,410
It's okay.
Here's the key thing.

836
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,280
It's okay to look at someone and based 
on the way they look,

837
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:22,110
dislike them and treat them badly.
And if you think that's okay,

838
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,910
then this is the problem.
This is common enemy identity politics.

839
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,210
I think that's horrible.
We shouldn't be judging people based on 

840
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,930
their race then that's,
you're probably supportive comments,

841
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:35,400
humanity,
identity politics as well.

842
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,800
I actually would like to push back 
against the idea that it's just straight

843
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:44,801
white men anymore.
I felt like I always feel like 

844
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:47,440
unfortunately,
sort of like the Stanford Palo Alto 

845
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
Slash San Francisco Bay area is 
unfortunately way ahead on these trends.

846
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,330
And I think one of the reasons why you 
are seeing pushback from minority 

847
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,381
members.
Well it's partially because for a long 

848
00:44:59,381 --> 00:44:59,381
time,
at least among the friends,

849
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:00,480
I don't really believe in this and 
almost like a religious kind of way.

850
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,410
Um,
they're,

851
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:06,590
they're,
they're extremely guilty about simply 

852
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:06,960
being cisgendered as a non transgender 
that you,

853
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,860
you'll,
you'll see sort of this call out culture

854
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,380
applied to a straight black men for 
example.

855
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:17,381
So I do think that we,
we've been falling deeper and deeper 

856
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:17,381
down the rabbit hole where people are 
realizing,

857
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,850
wow,
so this is just a permanent situation of

858
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,140
guilt and shame about an identity that I
have no control over.

859
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:25,520
That can't possibly be right.

860
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,140
Well,
the other thing we can point out too is 

861
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,121
that even if you do make allowances for 
the fact that let's say on average 

862
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:38,480
straight white men are doing or have 
done relatively well economically,

863
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:43,481
it's also very much worth pointing out 
that it's a tiny minority of straight 

864
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:45,830
white men who have been doing 
spectacularly well.

865
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,260
You know,
so you have a distribution problem 

866
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,070
within each with each,
within each ethnic identity group.

867
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,640
And so to say that because on average 
the socioeconomic status of a given 

868
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,250
group is higher than the status of 
another group.

869
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:06,370
All of the people who are members of 
that group are disproportionately 

870
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,150
benefiting is actually a rather.
I'm in,

871
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,660
I would say a rather motivated and 
resentful analysis because it is always 

872
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,251
a tiny proportion of people in a group 
that are doing spectacularly well and 

873
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:21,711
then then you have to do something else 
which is you have to look at that 

874
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:26,170
proportion that are doing spectacularly 
well and you have to decide about how 

875
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,080
many of them are doing well because they
actually deserve it and how many of them

876
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:35,081
are doing well because they're 
inappropriate rent seekers and I would 

877
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:38,561
say because our culture is pretty damn 
functional and because we do generate a 

878
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:41,510
lot of wealth along with the inequality 
that there's a fair number of people who

879
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:46,511
are doing just proportionately well who 
are doing that by benefiting everyone 

880
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:50,141
else and we're not very careful about 
making those sorts of distinctions and 

881
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:50,141
they're actually crucial.

882
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,510
Right?
So that's what we did.

883
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:56,530
So in chapter 11 we go into social 
justice and many people have claimed 

884
00:46:57,041 --> 00:47:00,490
social justice is a meaningless term,
gets thrown around in certain ways.

885
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:03,070
People can't define it.
I'm digging into it.

886
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,950
We decided that it actually is 
meaningful,

887
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:10,951
but we have to.
We have to break it down into its 

888
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:13,471
component parts and so we go into what 
is the psychology of justice and if you 

889
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:19,021
focus on distributive justice,
aren't people getting what they deserve 

890
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:22,351
based on their inputs?
Everybody recognizes when people are 

891
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:22,351
being cheated that they're,
you know,

892
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:24,310
like in America now,
a lot of low wage workers,

893
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,570
the companies have found ways to skimp 
on benefits and pay,

894
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,990
so that is a violation of of 
distributive fairness.

895
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,100
People recognize that that is wrong if 
that is disproportionately affecting one

896
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:39,790
race or if people are being cheated 
because they are members of any identity

897
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:40,000
group.

898
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,770
That is a violation,
I would say,

899
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:46,771
of social justice or injustice applied 
to identity groups that we think is a 

900
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:51,400
very important concept.
Simply procedural justice.

901
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,400
If the criminal justice system ends up 
for whatever reason,

902
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,700
getting better representation to some 
groups than others or treating people 

903
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,010
differently at any point,
that is a violation of justice,

904
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:05,530
which can possibly quality violation of 
social justice.

905
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,950
What we pushed back against is the shift
in recent years to this obsessive 

906
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,660
emphasis on outcomes.
Social justice argument seems to be on 

907
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,240
campus as you just say,
look,

908
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,960
men are overrepresented among coders.
Well,

909
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,140
they're not overrepresented among all 
other functions at Google and apple.

910
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,820
If you look at everyone else in the 
company,

911
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,400
you know it's 50 slash 50.
We're very close.

912
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:32,790
It's only in certain job classifications
where there's a disparity and so people 

913
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,590
take that as ipso facto proof of 
systemic sexism,

914
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,520
but we really push back hard on saying 
that's lazy.

915
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,170
That's unfair,
that's inaccurate.

916
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,710
That's an invitation.
Those disparities or an invitation to 

917
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,310
look closer and if you see that the 
pipeline is 50 slash 50,

918
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:50,770
but the outcome is,
well then you've got a strong case.

919
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,910
But if the pipeline from Grad programs 
and computer science is exactly the same

920
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,870
as the representation among coders at 
Google and apple,

921
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:04,170
well you know,
you have to do something to show that 

922
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,571
people are being treated differently.
So we think there's a lot of bad 

923
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,361
thinking gun in the service of 
prosecuting one's political agenda 

924
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,710
within the culture war and that a lot of
people don't know how to stand up to it.

925
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,770
And one thing that I find interesting 
but district become a blast from this 

926
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,590
argument is a personal preference,
particularly when people talk about 

927
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,950
gender.
So I mean if you've ever actually read,

928
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,410
for example,
the speech that got Larry Summers and so

929
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:28,411
much trouble,
incredibly conclusion is it's probably 

930
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:31,630
mostly that these are not,
a lot of these jobs are not our job.

931
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:34,420
So the,
a lot of the theoretical physics things,

932
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,650
they don't have a lot of appeal to 
women.

933
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,780
He,
he basically,

934
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:41,781
he comes down for some reason saying 
that there might actually be a reason 

935
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:43,390
why no veterinary sciences,
overwhelmingly women,

936
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,080
some of some of these mathematical 
fields are overwhelming.

937
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,490
Mimic,
might have something to do with it.

938
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,330
Some small differences in what people 
actually liked doing somehow.

939
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:59,510
So the biggest London Times just did an 
article this week on two papers that 

940
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,050
came out,
um,

941
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:06,050
was quite an interesting article because
one of the papers came out showing once 

942
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,000
again that the personality differences 
between men and women are largest in the

943
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:14,001
most egalitarian societies.
And they actually get quite large by 

944
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:16,770
psychological standards in countries 
like Holland or the Netherlands.

945
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:21,771
And also in the Scandinavian countries,
which are the most egalitarian 

946
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:24,771
countries,
but the biggest difference between men 

947
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,471
and women and also one that grows in 
more egalitarian countries is an 

948
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:27,920
interest and that that

949
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,080
difference is more than the standard 
deviation.

950
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:32,180
It's like one and a half standard 
deviations.

951
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,610
And so it's more than enough to account 
for the disparity between male engineers

952
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,750
and our female engineers and male 
nurses.

953
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,470
And the fact that it grows as societies 
become more egalitarian is actually a 

954
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,980
death blow to social constructionist 
theory.

955
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,960
That's right.
So,

956
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:54,970
so let's go into this because this is a 
really helpful area where I think we 

957
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,350
have a good idea what's going on and we 
can see why it's so hard to find.

958
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,790
Find the truth here.
Um,

959
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,240
so when I taught at Uva,
I had a lecture on sex and gender and I 

960
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:10,021
went into sex differences and have clear
finding for many decades is that if you 

961
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:12,740
look at differences in ability between 
men and women,

962
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:16,550
they're very few and far between.
Men are better at spacial rotation.

963
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,720
Women on some images are a little bit or
at social skills and language.

964
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,390
So there are some differences,
but they're few and far between.

965
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:28,810
If you look at the differences in what 
kids like and what they choose to do 

966
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,311
when there's no adult watching,
their huge little boys and girls play 

967
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:34,370
radically differently by my wife and I,
we,

968
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,600
um,
we once gave up my triplet nephews and 

969
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,151
they were four years old,
four years old again from a bag of 

970
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:44,341
plastic dinosaurs and the two boys 
grabbed a dinosaur and they start 

971
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:47,671
battling the bashing them together and 
the girl takes two dinosaurs and she 

972
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,110
says,
don't ever leave me money.

973
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:53,150
I won't be so dope.
But the point is girls and boys play 

974
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,430
really differently.
And if you,

975
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:59,710
if they're supervised by adults,
the differences get smaller was if you 

976
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,310
let kids play on their own,
the differences get bigger.

977
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,340
Differences in interest are huge and 
crucial.

978
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,810
Finding.
Jordan,

979
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,010
I'd like to ask you what,
why,

980
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:12,090
why is this?
Why do you think this is treated so 

981
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:12,090
much?
Like heretical.

982
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:12,220
Bless was thought that must be 
immediately shot down,

983
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,660
that you zeroed in on the property issue
before.

984
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:19,790
When you talked about the equity Dr.
now,

985
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:24,791
one of the things I've been trying to 
figure out is how we know when the left 

986
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:28,040
goes too far.
Now we know when the right goes too far,

987
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:31,280
when they start making ethno nationalist
claims of superiority.

988
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,400
It's something like that and claiming 
that all the good things should happen 

989
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,180
to one ethnic or racial group.
Okay.

990
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:43,181
Know where you're outside the domain of 
reasonable political discourse at that 

991
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:47,261
point.
Now obviously the same thing can happen 

992
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:47,261
on the left,
but when it happens,

993
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:48,770
it's not so obvious.
There's no smoking pistol,

994
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,220
but I think emphasis on equity,
which is code word for equality of 

995
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,720
outcome is actually the smoking pistol.
If you had to pick one.

996
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,880
No.
Okay.

997
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,890
I would disagree with you on that.
That can't be a smoking pistol.

998
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,740
Emphasizing equity can't get smoking.
Pistol,

999
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,980
I think we mean by smoking pistol is 
when someone makes an argument in good 

1000
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,921
faith trying to understand some 
phenomenon in the world and they suffer 

1001
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,180
social consequences.
That's the smoking pistol.

1002
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:18,070
Why we might be talking about two 
slightly different things.

1003
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,110
I'm.
I'm maybe not.

1004
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:25,410
I'm trying to figure out where the.
Where the tipping point is on the left 

1005
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:31,081
that makes things spiral out of control 
and you guys talked about the equality 

1006
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:35,430
of outcome doctrine as as the wrong.
First of all,

1007
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,610
it doesn't allow for multivariate 
analysis.

1008
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:39,030
Right?
Which is a big problem,

1009
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:44,031
so it oversimplifies things radically if
there's a difference in outcome than 

1010
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:45,180
ipso facto.
There is a victim,

1011
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:50,181
victimizer,
a narrative driving it or reality 

1012
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:52,770
driving it and I think that the,
the,

1013
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:58,060
the fundamental problem on the radical 
left is exactly that and that's the 

1014
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:02,640
reason that they don't like the 
literature on gender differences because

1015
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:07,910
you can point to gender differences in 
outcome and you can use them as proof 

1016
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,030
for the oppressive nature of society,
but if you look into it and you find out

1017
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,240
that that's actually not proof that some
of the differences,

1018
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,330
even some of the differences in outcome 
are being driven by things like 

1019
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,350
biological difference in interest than 
it radically weakens that central 

1020
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,520
axiomatic claim of fundamental 
oppression.

1021
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:31,521
And so that's viewed as an existential 
threat by people for whom that's the 

1022
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:34,800
cardinal presupposition is.
That's how it looks to me.

1023
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:40,380
That is correct since since reading the 
righteous mind,

1024
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:42,720
I always like to analyze things in terms
of what sacred,

1025
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,660
organized.
They circle around it,

1026
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:50,661
that binds them together.
There are a lot of things that people 

1027
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:50,661
hold sacred,
you know,

1028
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:54,420
on all sides,
but I am struck by the fact that in the 

1029
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,730
academy it's not just questioning sacred
values of any sort.

1030
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,610
It's specifically questioning diversity 
policies.

1031
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:04,611
That seems to be the most dangerous 
thing to do and that does fit with what 

1032
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:07,011
you said that it's like it's a big 
project that we're all engaged in and 

1033
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:11,541
we'll working hard against the enemy and
we're fighting the fight and if one of 

1034
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:15,291
us steps out and said,
well actually maybe we'll wrong on this 

1035
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:15,291
point.
Bang,

1036
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,220
we've got to shoot them.
We can't have got to shooter.

1037
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:21,410
Yeah.
Now that probability would be 

1038
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:21,410
proportionate to the centrality of the 
axiom.

1039
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,650
I think the central axiom here,
that's it's causing all the trouble,

1040
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,790
is the insistence that the best way to 
insistence's one.

1041
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:35,791
Is that the best way to characterize 
Western society as an oppressive 

1042
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:35,791
patriarchy?

1043
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,550
That's right.

1044
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,160
Yes.
And,

1045
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:42,270
and the second is that the best way to 
characterize people is by their group 

1046
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,300
and those two things interact.
And so the gender data is particularly a

1047
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:52,150
horrifying,
I would say to people who hold those 

1048
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,150
axioms because,
well,

1049
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,840
for two reasons,
one is because the gender differences 

1050
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,910
actually exist and they do account for 
differences in outcome,

1051
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:59,300
but even worse,
and this is a catastrophe,

1052
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:04,330
I think for the social constructionist,
is that as you put egalitarian social 

1053
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:09,461
policies into play,
that the very differences that you hate 

1054
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:10,220
get bigger.
And that's,

1055
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,700
and this needs to be said a thousand 
times because it really is,

1056
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,720
it's,
it's a fatal blow to the social 

1057
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,030
constructionist egalitarianism and even 
to the concepts they're using.

1058
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:22,400
Because one thing we could also ask is 
like,

1059
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,700
well,
if turns out that men and women are as 

1060
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,740
different in egalitarianism societies as
boys and girls are in there,

1061
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:33,400
unsupervised play,
I think is a reasonable analog,

1062
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,880
then we're going to have differences in 
outcome that are going to be magnified 

1063
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,750
by the very policies that the 
egalitarian or putting in place.

1064
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,710
And then we also might ask to his inner 
truly,

1065
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,590
uh,
in this society that we want to set up,

1066
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,280
maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the 
case that people's free choice would 

1067
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,991
determine their occupational outcomes 
and then we have to put up with a 

1068
00:56:57,991 --> 00:56:59,800
certain degree of inequality of outcome 
and think in a complex way about it.

1069
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,690
We were talking about about sacredness 
and one of the stories we talked about 

1070
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:12,571
in the book,
I know you're very well familiar with 

1071
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:14,970
the Rebecca to bell story paper,
an academic paper talking about,

1072
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,880
well,
if we accept transsexuality,

1073
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,940
what implications does that have for 
someone like Rachel woke,

1074
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,180
kind of wants to decide what,
what a,

1075
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:30,310
what a racist.
She claimed that she was black heels,

1076
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,720
black inside.
And um,

1077
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,890
and,
and both John and I are very,

1078
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,170
we've really tried to sort of be 
reasonable as possible,

1079
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:39,460
aggressively reasonable.
Um,

1080
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:40,870
but in that,
in this one we,

1081
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:41,370
uh,
we,

1082
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,770
we liken it to,
um,

1083
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,640
a male Durkheim's definition of witch 
hunts because it really,

1084
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:48,770
unfortunately really set because you not
only do you have this kind of like,

1085
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,290
you know,
like normal,

1086
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:55,291
interesting intellectual exercise of an 
academic article and making an 

1087
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:55,291
interesting point.
It,

1088
00:57:55,291 --> 00:58:00,010
she's treated absolutely like a blast 
summer and so badly that people are 

1089
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,750
signing letters condemning her while at 
the same time emailing saying,

1090
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,430
oh,
this is really terrible what happened to

1091
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:03,730
you.

1092
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:08,730
Um,
and it's just absolutely bizarre and 

1093
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,810
scary as the smoking gun proves that 
there's a problem is when there are 

1094
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:15,751
social consequences to make good faith 
are out in the public square.

1095
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:17,590
If you're in the comments section on 
Youtube,

1096
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:21,010
of course we're trying to do with 
universities,

1097
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:26,011
is this really unique and important 
thing which is create an environment in 

1098
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:27,280
which people are expected to challenge 
each other.

1099
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,590
We're not supposed to be there to be 
agreeable and it all makes sense.

1100
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,660
It's all okay because it's the surface 
service of finding truth.

1101
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,940
And as soon as people who are taking 
part in that process are shamed,

1102
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:40,900
punished,
excluded,

1103
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,520
there calls to expel them or punish 
them,

1104
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,820
as soon as that happens,
now we have more of a sort of east 

1105
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,210
German mindset where people are not 
thinking about what's true,

1106
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,510
they're thinking about,
you know,

1107
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,430
what will,
what will avoid getting in trouble,

1108
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:56,431
what am I allowed to say by the fact of 
what will get me incredible praise for 

1109
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:58,710
being,
throwing myself as a true believer.

1110
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,190
Tremendous amount of authority is 
motivated by the desire to avoid being 

1111
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:09,540
shunned and treated as the violator up 
at taboo because that's exactly what's 

1112
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:13,150
happening is that there are,
there are new taboos.

1113
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:18,850
So then part of the question might be to
why is there such an insistence that the

1114
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,370
culture we live in is a patriarchal 
tyranny,

1115
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,190
which is also a collapse of complexity,
right?

1116
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:28,190
I mean,
obviously our culture has its flaws.

1117
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,830
It,
it tends towards,

1118
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,570
um,
rigidity and tyranny,

1119
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:35,720
like all cultures do.
But comparatively speaking,

1120
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,890
as we've talked about before,
by,

1121
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:41,210
by world standards today or by world 
standards,

1122
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,620
historically,
it's a pretty damn free and,

1123
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,780
and productive culture.
But we have this tremendous emphasis on 

1124
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,500
the idea that it's fundamentally a 
patriarchal tyranny,

1125
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:56,501
and that if you a question that then 
you're treated as a taboo violator.

1126
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,310
So then the question is,
well,

1127
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,410
what the hell is driving this insistence
that it's a patriarchal purity with,

1128
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,180
with Kate Millett?

1129
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,060
No,
you see who originated,

1130
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,060
at least in part patriarchy theory.
You see that she had a very,

1131
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:16,330
she had an alcoholic and abusive father.
And so I think that's quite interesting 

1132
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,440
because I think there are psychological 
dynamics here at work.

1133
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:23,441
I,
I wonder to what degree the people who 

1134
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:23,441
are pushing this theory,
um,

1135
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,050
have had very disturbed interpersonal 
relationships,

1136
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,970
gender relationships,
and that,

1137
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
that's,
that's what would you say driving the 

1138
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,710
collapse of their political viewpoint in
to a single dimension like a single 

1139
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,971
oversimplified dimension.
You see that sort of oversimplified 

1140
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:42,971
thinking when you look at,
at,

1141
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:45,830
at,
at psychopathological complexes,

1142
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:46,940
you know,
like with,

1143
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,620
with,
uh,

1144
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,680
with,
with women,

1145
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:50,840
with eating disorders in particular,
what men too.

1146
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:53,900
But that's rarer.
Everything collapses to a single,

1147
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,840
uh,
a single dimension of evaluation.

1148
01:00:56,841 --> 01:00:59,900
Something like thin equals beautiful or 
thin equals good.

1149
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,020
And then that drives everything.
And so,

1150
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,400
and then I also think maybe it is this 
also a challenge too to cultural 

1151
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:13,640
tradition,
an actual intellectual challenge.

1152
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:15,020
Say,
well we think that your,

1153
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,700
your,
your way of,

1154
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,780
of,
of,

1155
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,640
of operating within the culture is too,
too radical.

1156
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:25,641
That we're going to throw everything we 
can at you and an attempt to make you 

1157
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:26,800
prove that that's not true.
But I,

1158
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:29,330
I can't get any farther underneath it.
The math.

1159
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:35,590
So you're a clinical psychologist.
So I think your first impulse is let's 

1160
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:35,590
look to the person's formative 
experiences.

1161
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,460
Why do they think this way?
I'm a social psychologist.

1162
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,600
So I think in terms of if there's some 
new or some interesting social movement,

1163
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,080
what are the social forces and pressures
on them that led them to think this way?

1164
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,440
I also read a lot and think a lot about 
evolution.

1165
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,250
I like,
and this is what first drew me to you.

1166
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:56,251
You went through when I met in 1994.
We both loved Carl young and I love this

1167
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:00,990
idea of archetypes interpreted from an 
evolutionary point of view as to like,

1168
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,140
why do we dream about dragons?
Why do so many cultures have dragons?

1169
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:04,890
Well,
actually,

1170
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,510
you know,
our ancestors,

1171
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:07,860
you know,
60 million years ago,

1172
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:09,520
actually,
we're in a world of dinosaurs.

1173
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,400
That's a pretty cool idea.
I don't know if that's right.

1174
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,640
Anyway,
I'm human beings have a tendency to 

1175
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,280
think in a manichaean style.
It's effortless.

1176
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:19,950
It's default for us to divide the world 
into good and evil.

1177
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:24,951
And that's why the third grade on truth 
in our book is the untruth of US versus 

1178
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,480
them.
Life is a battle between good people and

1179
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,590
evil people.
It's very hard to teach this to people.

1180
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,060
Um,
so,

1181
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:38,150
uh,
so we think that is innate as a 

1182
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,771
possibility.
And then the question is why are some 

1183
01:02:39,771 --> 01:02:41,961
movements now teaching this and why is 
it making more progress in some areas 

1184
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,000
the university now than it was 10 or 20 
years ago?

1185
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,770
Um,
so I think that,

1186
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,300
to answer your question,
if you were engaged in a,

1187
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:55,340
in a radical program,
radical means you want to tear things 

1188
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:55,340
down,
you want radical change,

1189
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,570
you need to demonize the country to the 
structure.

1190
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:02,571
You want to tear down,
you need to say that America is the 

1191
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:02,571
worst.

1192
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:03,150
America is a paragon of racism and 
sexism.

1193
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,430
And of course we have our problems.
You know,

1194
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:10,431
most of us think that things have been 
getting steadily better since the 19th 

1195
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:10,431
century.
Um,

1196
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:12,150
but you're committed to saying that 
America is the worst.

1197
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:15,000
So there was an interesting study 
published a few months ago,

1198
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,870
if you've probably heard about this,
it rent America as like the,

1199
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,720
like the twelfth worst country on earth 
for women.

1200
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:23,220
It was behind,
you know,

1201
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:28,221
Eritrea and Sudan and you know,
North Korea know it was the one of the 

1202
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,320
worst places on earth to be a woman.
And you know,

1203
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,110
just on the smell test and really like,
um,

1204
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:39,510
you know,
I don't want to go into why that's so 

1205
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,510
wrong.
But at the methodology it was,

1206
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:40,470
it was judged by her.
I can't remember what it was.

1207
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:42,750
But despite,
obviously it was in the judgment of like

1208
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,580
human rights activists or something like
that,

1209
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,370
rights activists are generally many of 
them,

1210
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:51,180
and just American human rights activist.
I was something like that.

1211
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:57,130
They are not weighing up statistics on 
how women fare around the world.

1212
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,870
They're being asked what are the worst 
countries for women?

1213
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:02,720
And if you were engaged in the project 
of critique in America,

1214
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,390
you're motivated to say that America is 
the worst.

1215
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,490
And that's explained that ranking

1216
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:13,270
that justifies your continued activism 
and if that's what you've staked your 

1217
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:13,670
career on them,
that's also necessary.

1218
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,820
I also think that's one of the things 
that's driving all of the things that 

1219
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,811
we're talking about is that we've 
produced a committed activists class 

1220
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:26,561
that has been heavily subsidized for 30 
years and they are always in need of 

1221
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,120
reasons to justify their continued 
existence.

1222
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,780
I mean,
as,

1223
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,400
as we all are,
of course,

1224
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:36,700
but,
but this is a situation where that's 

1225
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:36,700
become dangerous,

1226
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,570
committed activists class.
Um,

1227
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,600
I think this is important also to focus 
on for a moment because in discussions 

1228
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,560
of this,
we're all supposed to praise the 

1229
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:46,560
students political activity.
We're all supposed to praise activism,

1230
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,860
um,
and you know,

1231
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:50,290
Pepsi tried that disastrous commercial 
of just like,

1232
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:55,630
you know,
random beautiful people being activist 

1233
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:55,630
because if you have a bullhorn,
bullhorn,

1234
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:00,270
that's political activity goes.
So I think there is an idea among young 

1235
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:08,251
people,
and this is I think more true on the 

1236
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:09,661
left,
that to be political is to be 

1237
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:12,631
protesting.
Just telling me like why is it that the 

1238
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:12,631
right when they're upset about 
something,

1239
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,430
they go and they get people to the 
school board and they changed the rules.

1240
01:05:15,431 --> 01:05:18,250
Like the right I think is more pragmatic
in its politics.

1241
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,070
The left is more expressive and I think 
this is a point that Mark Lilla has been

1242
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,510
made so ultimately ends up backfiring.

1243
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,630
But I think that the,
the,

1244
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,840
the,
the respect that we accord to activism,

1245
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:36,841
pure and simple.
I think that should be rethought and I 

1246
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:42,990
might be about to do that.
One President of a major university in 

1247
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:47,681
this,
in this region recently said something 

1248
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,690
to the effect that universities are 
becoming ungovernable now.

1249
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:51,760
There's a lot of reasons for that.
They face a lot of pressures,

1250
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,600
but the student activism,
the fact that it's,

1251
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:55,840
it's.
It can be anything.

1252
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:01,050
It's not addressed at injustice.
It's addressed at something in the 

1253
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:01,950
dining hall,
something that a student,

1254
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:06,951
but it's because there are protests 
about almost anything I think many 

1255
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:07,720
administrators are realizing what have 
we done,

1256
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:11,920
what kind of Frankenstein monster have 
we created by incentivizing and praising

1257
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,760
this kind of of,
of,

1258
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,560
of activism.

1259
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:20,660
Our whole being talking to politicians 
in Canada about the possibility of 

1260
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,640
making a distinction between education 
and activism and political activism.

1261
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:29,910
So you know in Canada if you're a 
charitable organization,

1262
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:32,880
you can't engage in political activism 
now.

1263
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:37,881
It's very difficult to distinguish 
between what might constitute education 

1264
01:06:37,881 --> 01:06:42,351
and what might constitute activism,
but the idea that there's something 

1265
01:06:42,351 --> 01:06:43,890
intrinsically moral and noble about,
about,

1266
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,200
about complaining about the evil people 
in the world is definitely something you

1267
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:54,201
don't want literature.
The humanities used to be the antidote 

1268
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:57,441
to that to some degree because one of 
the things that characterize is great 

1269
01:06:57,441 --> 01:07:01,491
literature as opposed to secondary 
literature is that if the literature is 

1270
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:06,440
great,
the battle between good and evil occurs 

1271
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:06,440
in the hearts of each protagonist,
right?

1272
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,690
It's a psychological issue and not a 
sociological issue.

1273
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,060
I'm turning here to our opening quotes.
Um,

1274
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,300
and we already talked about one instance
of one of our three opening quotes,

1275
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,690
the line dividing good and evil cuts 
through the heart of every human being.

1276
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,440
And that is what we should be teaching 
students to complexify situation to the 

1277
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,370
extent that we teach them.
No,

1278
01:07:31,371 --> 01:07:33,350
it's simple.
If you know the category,

1279
01:07:33,351 --> 01:07:35,570
you know their moral valence and you 
know there are bad.

1280
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:40,571
And so you've sent that.
We are teaching students to think in 

1281
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:40,571
this way.
We are harming them.

1282
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:43,360
You're setting them up for failure.
We are preparing them for citizenship in

1283
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:46,880
a democracy and we are harming the 
future of our country.

1284
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,020
And I probably have,
I have a

1285
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,270
little bit of insight,
a as a first amendment lawyer,

1286
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:56,310
um,
as someone who's spent a lot of time 

1287
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,041
defending the rights protestors and I've
dealt with very many protestors who were

1288
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:03,801
protesting utterly sensible things that 
I'm like absolutely more power to you.

1289
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,120
But also I've talked to other people who
I felt were tilting at windmills or,

1290
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:08,880
or,
or,

1291
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,970
um,
one time representative group that was,

1292
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:16,220
or Algebra represented group that 
believed that the US should have no navy

1293
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,720
I'm talking about.
So it's not that you think we should 

1294
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,780
spend less on military,
but we should literally have no navy.

1295
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:29,110
And that was the argument and I would 
ask some of my activist friends in San 

1296
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,420
Francisco,
some of them were doing,

1297
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:33,020
I think particularly with criminal 
justice and that kind of stuff,

1298
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:39,380
but another case.
So they'd see sort of activists sort of 

1299
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:39,380
groups that were,
you know,

1300
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,820
for example,
I opposed the second Iraq war.

1301
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,120
Um,
but I had friends who also oppose it 

1302
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,400
would immediately go into a and nine 
slash 11 was a conspiracy to,

1303
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,230
to allow for the.
I'm like,

1304
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,760
why are you moving it to that next 
argument where you're going to lose more

1305
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:57,761
people and the perception was that we 
have to keep the temperature at boiling 

1306
01:08:57,761 --> 01:09:02,081
point,
we have to keep it a to 12 or else 

1307
01:09:02,081 --> 01:09:04,370
people will lose interest and I actually
to in pinker is actually more correct on

1308
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:09,371
this is that we're actually creating 
virtually through some some of the 

1309
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:10,910
postmodern is thoughts that we're 
creating,

1310
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,270
a situation in which actually progress 
is more or less hopeless and all you can

1311
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:18,230
really do a shout about it,
which actually makes people more cynical

1312
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:22,880
and does less to achieve your goals.
Whereas as pinker likes to point out,

1313
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,260
if we actually look at,
well,

1314
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,020
what did we do that actually works and 
try to keep doing that,

1315
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:30,280
that's probably a better bet for actual 
progress knowing.

1316
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:35,450
Welcome,
perverse thing there too is that I 

1317
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:35,680
believe this to be true.
John,

1318
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,060
you mentioned that there's been a 
variety of books coming out.

1319
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:44,150
Maybe I could get that list and post 
them in the description of this youtube 

1320
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,650
video that might be useful,
but there's also a whole string of books

1321
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:50,700
that's been published lately,
including Steven Pinker's book,

1322
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:55,701
enlightenment,
now showing that the rate of economic 

1323
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:59,361
progress around the world,
especially with regard to lifting the 

1324
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,451
abjectly poor out of poverty is 
increasing at an unparalleled rate and 

1325
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:07,440
that might be a secondary benefit to the
collapse of communism since 1989.

1326
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:12,710
A lot of things are driving it,
but certainly some of it is the spread 

1327
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:16,191
of ideas of individual sovereignty and 
the use of free market policies by 

1328
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:18,530
developing countries.
Just as we see the,

1329
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,860
the landscape for poor around the world 
to be radically improved during this 

1330
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:28,731
process and the west of criticizing our 
fundamental principles to the point 

1331
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:28,731
where we're.

1332
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:30,960
We're driving a dangerous level of 
polarization.

1333
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,380
And so that's our very perverse and 
strange situation and difficult to 

1334
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:36,900
contend with.
So.

1335
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,480
All right,
let's,

1336
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,290
let's switch a bit here.
One of left.

1337
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,870
Okay.
So while we see the problem,

1338
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:48,830
the problem is that we're still 
sketching it out and trying to 

1339
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:51,440
articulate it,
but it's something like the rise of a,

1340
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,820
a victim,
victimizer culture that might be driven 

1341
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,971
by young people's increasing sense of 
vulnerability as a consequence of the 

1342
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:04,830
unexamined effects of social media,
the big polarization driven by tendency 

1343
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:11,050
for a dying media to come to concentrate
on extremism,

1344
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:17,190
the domination of the intellectual 
discourse in the universities by the 

1345
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,470
left and the radical left.
All these things are playing together 

1346
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:22,770
and they're causing a certain amount of 
trouble,

1347
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:27,771
like the rise of this excessive safety 
culture that has negative psychological 

1348
01:11:27,771 --> 01:11:29,070
consequences.
All right,

1349
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:32,580
that's all dangerous.
What do we do about it,

1350
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,830
Jonathan?
You have the Heterodox Academy.

1351
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,390
So.
So that's,

1352
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:41,500
that's,
that's something you've put into 

1353
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,060
practice that was designed to increase 
viewpoint diversity.

1354
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:44,070
Do you think that's.
What's your sense of that?

1355
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,630
What's the consequence of that?

1356
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,910
Yeah,
so the problem is,

1357
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,010
as you said,
as we say in the book,

1358
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,460
there's six different separate 
contributing factors all coming 

1359
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:55,740
together.
The solution is not easy.

1360
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:01,040
Let's break it down into what do we need
to do to get our universities 

1361
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,740
functioning better,
what do we need to do to raise kids who 

1362
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,100
are more resilient and more able to deal
with difference?

1363
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,850
Let's focus on those two.
So let's.

1364
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,190
So let's start with universities.
So,

1365
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,710
uh,
I cofounded Heterodox Academy,

1366
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:17,190
if you go to Heterodoxacademy.org
with Nick Rosenkranz,

1367
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,540
last caller and Chris Martin,
a Grad student in sociology and then a 

1368
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,230
bunch of other social psychologists,
um,

1369
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,760
because we were concerned that this is 
just a faculty initiative that 

1370
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,870
discussions among professors of 
psychology and research and psychology 

1371
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,100
was showing signs that certain 
hypotheses wouldn't be investigated.

1372
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:40,370
Other interpretations were favored.
We were seeing signs and almost all of 

1373
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,090
us were on the left or center.
There are,

1374
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,220
there's only two conservative social 
psychologist that I know of.

1375
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:48,210
We were concerned about research 
quality.

1376
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,540
That's all it was.
And so we ended up putting up this site,

1377
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,210
went live on or about September 10th,
2015.

1378
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,840
Totally unrelated to that.
Greg and I had been writing the Atlantic

1379
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:02,841
article totally separate track and then 
all hell broke loose at Halloween in 

1380
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:06,810
2015 and it became clear this isn't just
a faculty issue.

1381
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:11,340
The problem on campus is a culture issue
in which in which student,

1382
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:14,130
this new form of student activism,
this new form of student,

1383
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,180
that belief in fragility is affecting 
how we do our research,

1384
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:23,210
how we educate,
so all problems are interrelated a bit 

1385
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:24,180
to focus on the faculty issue.
What we're doing in Heterodox Academy.

1386
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,070
Provisionally,
when I was running it,

1387
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,810
I thought the issue was,
well,

1388
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,420
we have no political diversity.
We need to get more.

1389
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:35,421
We need to encourage more conservatives 
and Libertarians to get phd's and then 

1390
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:35,790
we need to help them get jobs.

1391
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:40,790
That's what I thought originally,
but over time the problem has morphed a 

1392
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:45,560
and it's become clear.
We do actually have some diversity in 

1393
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,110
every field.
Not everybody is on the left.

1394
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:50,250
A lot of people are in the center or 
libertarian or they say,

1395
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:55,370
I can't be putting a box,
and what we have to do is encourage 

1396
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,250
those people to feel that they can speak
up,

1397
01:13:56,251 --> 01:13:59,670
they can question dominant ideas,
they can be a little subversive.

1398
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,060
Um,
they have to make it so they're not 

1399
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:05,060
afraid of social consequences for 
speaking of.

1400
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,540
So that's the way that I was thinking 
about it now.

1401
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:07,300
Uh,
in Janet,

1402
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,630
last January,
I turned over a heterodox academy.

1403
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,010
I hired an amazing woman,
Deborah.

1404
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,810
She's a professor at Harvey Mudd 
College.

1405
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:18,811
She is leaving that job to run heterodox
academy full time deb studies 

1406
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:20,740
relationships.
She's a great teacher.

1407
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:24,700
She is moving the organization to focus 
more on helping,

1408
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:29,050
helping campuses recreate that climate 
that we all know and love.

1409
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,000
I mean,
you know,

1410
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,630
we,
I love being a professor.

1411
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:36,631
I love universities.
I'm deb is focusing on how do we prepare

1412
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:41,830
students.
And so we've talked a lot about this in 

1413
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,830
the book.
What do you do at orientation?

1414
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,880
What are the norms you made clear about 
speech and free speech.

1415
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Of course we need to do training in 
diversity and inclusion and sexual 

1416
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,120
violence,
all that stuff,

1417
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,690
but how many schools trained for free 
speech?

1418
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,380
Pretty much none of them.
Then the fact that we don't mention any 

1419
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,741
of these deep philosophy,
major concepts that will be deep 

1420
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:00,100
philosophical underpinnings of academic 
freedom,

1421
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:02,590
freedom of speech,
but there's just so much we can complain

1422
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:04,900
about students not knowing them when 
nobody's actually thought.

1423
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:05,020
So

1424
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,080
it's been really interesting on this 
lecture tour and find out how receptive 

1425
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,030
people are to exactly that kind of 
message,

1426
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:15,220
you know,
and I've been beating the drum,

1427
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:20,221
let's say four or more conscious 
understanding of the relationship 

1428
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:24,130
between meaning and personal 
responsibility because one of the things

1429
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:26,650
we also teach students is that,
um,

1430
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,400
the proper focus for them is the 
violation of their intrinsic rights as 

1431
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:37,651
if the upholding of those rights is 
going to provide them with a sustaining 

1432
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:39,310
meaning in life.
But I don't believe that that's true.

1433
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:44,311
I think that what's,
what's more true is that most people 

1434
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:48,091
find a sustaining meaning by adopting a 
fairly heavy burden of personal 

1435
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:50,440
responsibility partly for themselves and
partly for their family.

1436
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:52,830
And partly for the broader community and
that,

1437
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:57,831
that that just seems to have dropped out
of the public discourse in its entirety 

1438
01:15:57,831 --> 01:16:02,611
and then also what could be taught to 
incoming students is this clinical 

1439
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:05,500
doctrine that we've been describing,
which is well,

1440
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:10,501
how do you make yourself stronger while 
you expose yourself voluntarily to 

1441
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:16,470
challenges that are outside of your 
domain of current competence and that 

1442
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,120
often involves confronting things that 
not only that you think are frightening,

1443
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:24,121
but you might also think are disgusting 
because that's what happens with 

1444
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:24,700
obsessive compulsive disorder treatment,
you know,

1445
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:29,701
and discussed,
obviously runs a motivates some of this 

1446
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:30,340
political polarization.

1447
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,850
That's right.
Somebody alerted me,

1448
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:37,110
somebody as civil rights scholar told me
about how the marchers in the sixties,

1449
01:16:37,111 --> 01:16:42,111
how they trained and here they are going
in to a staging,

1450
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:45,810
protests going in,
doing sit ins facing real violence,

1451
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:50,811
and some of them were actually killed.
The way they prepared for it was others 

1452
01:16:50,811 --> 01:16:53,160
would shout racist slurs at them.
They will be prepared for it.

1453
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:56,340
They would expose themselves to the 
worst and then when the worst happens,

1454
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:59,010
at least it was less painful than had 
they not encountered it.

1455
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,420
So again,
over and over again,

1456
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,670
we see.
Are you,

1457
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,580
is your goal to toughen yourself up?
Is your goal to become stronger and more

1458
01:17:05,581 --> 01:17:10,010
able to deal with the world as it is or 
is your goal to demand

1459
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,700
that somebody make the world other than.
Yeah,

1460
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,250
which is the which is the more reliable 
path to success in life.

1461
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,520
I'm in both John and I,
I'm president of fire and through 

1462
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:27,250
Heterodox we're both trying to also 
figure out ways to get to people well 

1463
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,640
before they set foot on a college 
campus.

1464
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:33,641
No,
certainly I think it's kind of 

1465
01:17:33,641 --> 01:17:34,811
unforgivable that most universities 
don't teach about some of these 

1466
01:17:34,811 --> 01:17:35,390
philosophies and concepts in 
orientation,

1467
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:38,150
but you should be learning about some of
these ideas when,

1468
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,700
when you're,
when you're in high school.

1469
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,900
So one thing that John did that I'm 
totally jealous of is they did a graphic

1470
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:49,901
novel version of a part of chapter two 
of on liberty about freedom of speech as

1471
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:54,030
a great way to tell a generation 
students about.

1472
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,690
And I also just love on liberty 
predictably argument,

1473
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:02,770
freedom of speech as a lawyer because 
I'm like this guy because this guy 

1474
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,860
argued being able to defend the decision
to defend blasts one meal to go up 

1475
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,040
against blasphemy prohibitions at 18,
59,

1476
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,110
but then managed to say,
and by the way,

1477
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:12,620
you know,
you know,

1478
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:17,650
who suffered under blasphemy laws,
Jesus and socrates guess enforced them.

1479
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:24,020
Marcus Aurelius also one of your heroes 
and it's like you just won the case.

1480
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:30,020
You're a world class.
So let me suggest that viewers go to 

1481
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:34,451
Amazon and look up all minus one a or go
to heterodoxacademy.org/mill.

1482
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:41,240
We can get a free version of pdf or you 
can have a $3 kindle version of it as 

1483
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,920
well as the printed Arco.
Great.

1484
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,580
Put that in the description as well.
Great.

1485
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,140
So yeah,
so high school,

1486
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,170
any high school that wants to teach 
about free speech and sign this,

1487
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:53,030
it's extremely readable by high school 
students.

1488
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,730
It's just chapter two,
cut by 50 percent.

1489
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,280
And metaphors are illustrated.
Yeah.

1490
01:18:59,330 --> 01:18:59,880
Okay.
Well,

1491
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:04,881
so the free speech issue too.
So one of the concepts that I've been 

1492
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:12,061
wrestling with is we have to produce 
hierarchies in order to accomplish tasks

1493
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,460
collectively and we have to accomplish 
tasks because they're suffering to 

1494
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,331
address real problems to solve.
So we're going to produce hierarchies 

1495
01:19:21,331 --> 01:19:25,291
and hopefully the hierarchies are 
predicated on merit in relationship to 

1496
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:30,061
the solution of the problem.
And so the right winger types are more 

1497
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:34,800
inclined to support hierarchical 
structures because of their 

1498
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,981
psychological predisposition and the 
left wingers are more likely to be 

1499
01:19:38,651 --> 01:19:43,651
concerned about the fact that the 
hierarchy's inevitably dispossessed 

1500
01:19:43,651 --> 01:19:45,340
because they'll produce on equal 
distribution of resources.

1501
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:50,630
Okay.
So then you can imagine that the 

1502
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,291
political landscape is a battleground,
are permanent battleground between those

1503
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:58,291
who stand for the hierarchies and note 
that they have their utility but are 

1504
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,940
perhaps blind to their proclivity to 
become tyrannical.

1505
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:06,300
And those who are more sensitive to the 
claims of the dispossessed and worried 

1506
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,550
about the proclivity of tyranny,
of hierarchies to become,

1507
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:12,030
um,
predicated on nothing but power.

1508
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:18,960
At some points the hierarchy is going to
be weak and need to be strengthened.

1509
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,200
And the other points,
there has to be more clamor on the side 

1510
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,700
of the dispossessed and the reason you 
have free speech as far as I'm concerned

1511
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:31,320
is because it's the mechanism that keeps
those two to opponent process,

1512
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:37,160
opponent process processes balanced.
And so it's a core,

1513
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:42,230
it's the core element of a free society 
because it's actually the process by 

1514
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:45,070
which the society maintains and improves
itself across time.

1515
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,670
So it's not just another value among 
many values

1516
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:59,140
is one of the founding fathers were 
really good evolutionary psychologists.

1517
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:05,381
Um,
and one thing that I love about working 

1518
01:21:05,381 --> 01:21:07,740
in constitutional law is just how both 
pessimistic and optimistic it was at the

1519
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:12,741
same time were the tensions of Alexander
Hamilton and Madison were so concerned 

1520
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:15,500
about like,
how do you,

1521
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,790
how do you balance out these natural 
human,

1522
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,800
it's human nature.
Whereas today,

1523
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:21,870
you know,
we're supposed to claim the reason.

1524
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:24,950
There isn't any such thing as human 
nature on.

1525
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,700
The other thing is I have a slightly 
different philosophy on,

1526
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,640
on freedom of speech.
It's actually much simpler than a lot of

1527
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,250
sort of like the more sort of like 
platonic,

1528
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:37,410
platonic ideal of truth,
which is simply that it's always 

1529
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:39,720
valuable to know what people really 
think as simple as that sounds.

1530
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,250
It does mean that when people say,
well,

1531
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:46,251
you certainly certainly you shouldn't be
listening to conspiracy theorists and 

1532
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:46,251
what they,
what they say about stuff.

1533
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:48,300
And I'm like,
if it's a popular conspiracies,

1534
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:53,330
shouldn't you have some clue about what 
some of the population actually thinks 

1535
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,640
about things?
And I think that we,

1536
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:55,880
we,
uh,

1537
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:01,440
that understanding what people you 
despise actually think and believe is 

1538
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,950
always a value because the project 
itself is a project of human knowledge.

1539
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,520
No one human beings as they actually are
not as we wish they were.

1540
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:14,150
I can use that terminology.
It's like if I want to know what you're 

1541
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:19,811
going to do and I do,
especially if I happen to be near you 

1542
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:21,500
or,
or have you or have to interact with you

1543
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:26,501
repeatedly.
If I know what you think and I can 

1544
01:22:26,501 --> 01:22:28,670
understand how you're going to ask,
and if I don't know how you,

1545
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,880
how you think,
partly because you're not allowed to 

1546
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,401
express it,
then you're an opaque mystery to me and 

1547
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:38,120
the probability that we're going to 
engage in conflict goes up tremendously.

1548
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,750
So I mean there are multiple reasons for
for the,

1549
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,680
for protecting the sanctity.
Let's say a free speech.

1550
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,620
Now,
one of the things that really distresses

1551
01:22:48,621 --> 01:22:53,621
me about the postmodern slash neo 
Marxist philosophy is that there isn't 

1552
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:58,340
any room in that philosophy for the idea
of free speech.

1553
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,330
Know this is something I've come to 
understand more deeply over the last two

1554
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:02,630
years.

1555
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,850
When you're talking to someone from that
theoretical.

1556
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:11,260
They can't engage in the discussion 
about free speech because it doesn't fit

1557
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:14,440
into their worldview because all there 
is.

1558
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:19,590
There isn't sovereign individuals 
engaging in a discussion about the 

1559
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:22,951
nature of reality.
There's avatars of their power group 

1560
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:26,820
unconsciously making claims on behalf of
their privilege and that there's never 

1561
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,050
free speech there because you don't want
a free agent.

1562
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,200
You're not even a real entity as an 
individual.

1563
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:32,870
And,
and,

1564
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:38,020
and that's a far more pernicious assault
on free speech than mere objection to 

1565
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:38,540
it,
as you know,

1566
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:43,541
a,
a right wing as something that's been 

1567
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:44,720
hijacked by the right wing to,
to validate their power,

1568
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,570
their particular privilege,

1569
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,030
because this is one of the main 
arguments that we get back,

1570
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:56,090
is a free speech is just a way for the 
powerful to retain their power.

1571
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:02,250
Greg's cause when the Nazis started 
having rallies for free speech.

1572
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:07,270
So that's really not what you want.
What's your response when people say 

1573
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,390
free speech is just to help some 
powerful.

1574
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:13,490
It drives me nuts because it's a 
fundamental misunderstanding of history 

1575
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:15,030
and government and political philosophy.
And I've,

1576
01:24:15,031 --> 01:24:19,350
I've had this argument with Stanley fish
and it seemed like a total shock to him.

1577
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:25,510
I'm sure it'd be thought of it before,
but you don't need a special protection 

1578
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,320
of an individual,
right?

1579
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,660
I'm in a democracy.
Um,

1580
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,590
uh,
uh,

1581
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:33,340
for the majority,
you,

1582
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,360
first of all,
rich people and powerful people under 

1583
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,990
any system of government where rich 
people's under communism,

1584
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,040
you know,
don't do so well.

1585
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:42,690
Um,
once they take over,

1586
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:43,820
but after they take over,
you know,

1587
01:24:43,821 --> 01:24:46,980
like the KGB people get rich and 
powerful.

1588
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:50,760
People are always going to be fine.
If you set up a democracy,

1589
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:53,020
I'm,
the majority is always,

1590
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,920
if there's a consistent majority,
the majority is always going to be fine.

1591
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:00,210
You only need a special protection of 
freedom of speech for minority points of

1592
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:00,480
view.

1593
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,310
No,
I know.

1594
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,990
It's absolutely amazing that that's not.

1595
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:08,490
And John Roche and it was really 
interesting.

1596
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:13,560
Refresh has a lot of interesting because
he says it's like,

1597
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:18,590
listen,
if you've reached the point where 

1598
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:18,590
there's enough,
uh,

1599
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,680
enough people who are worried about your
wellbeing,

1600
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:24,060
that they're willing to pass a law and a
majority country to get you protected.

1601
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,760
It probably means the real dark days are
behind you.

1602
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:32,170
Um,
and one of the things that we've talked 

1603
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:32,170
about me and Roche is that if we passed 
an anti,

1604
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,650
sort of a hate speech law saying the 
late 19 sixties,

1605
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:38,130
it would have frozen in place kind of 
attitudes about homosexuality,

1606
01:25:38,131 --> 01:25:43,131
which he was concerned about.
And I think we would have ended up with 

1607
01:25:43,131 --> 01:25:47,151
a law that looked a lot more like what 
you see in Russia that actually ends up 

1608
01:25:47,151 --> 01:25:50,001
being used against a gay people that 
then then rather these sort of 

1609
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:51,120
progressive law that we hope it would 
be.

1610
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,110
But time and time again,
the idea that you like,

1611
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:55,840
by the way I'm going,
I keep on trying to put this out to from

1612
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:00,270
a very practical way like so you want 
laws that define that,

1613
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:03,290
that allow the government to stop 
hateful speech and you want trump

1614
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:04,670
and some.

1615
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:11,710
There's an old military doctrine which 
is whatever weapon you design your 

1616
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:16,601
enemies will have in 15 years.
And if you start putting restrictions on

1617
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:22,241
something like free speech as a,
as a benefit to your ideological 

1618
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:26,891
position and you don't imagine that you 
might be out maneuvered in their use by 

1619
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:29,030
your enemies,
then you're not sufficiently awake.

1620
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,780
So when I did a lecture a year and a 
half ago,

1621
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,270
which was a left wing case for free 
speech,

1622
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:38,990
and I just thought that was self evident
for the reasons that you put forward,

1623
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:43,991
which is well the powerful,
and you can use leftwing terminology 

1624
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:48,011
here,
the powerful have an a priori monopoly 

1625
01:26:48,011 --> 01:26:52,541
on speech obviously.
And so you want to put protections in 

1626
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:56,471
place so that the dispossessed who you 
hypothetically champion get a chance to 

1627
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:58,430
put their viewpoint forward.
And it's really,

1628
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:03,670
it's quite a mystery that,
that that's not merely axiomatically 

1629
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:06,420
obvious now.
Yeah.

1630
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,100
Well,
you know,

1631
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:12,101
it's not Caesar calling for free speech.
It's the easy thing to do is say,

1632
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:13,740
okay,
well then it must be bad.

1633
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:15,520
Yeah.
Yes.

1634
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:16,470
Well,
okay.

1635
01:27:16,471 --> 01:27:18,300
So tell me,
let's go back to the book.

1636
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:24,580
So how you said earlier when we talked 
before the interview that it had,

1637
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:30,740
you know,
in the New York Times bestseller list 

1638
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:31,860
and it seems to be selling well,
what are you hoping,

1639
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:37,640
what do you see happening as a 
consequence of your essay in the 

1640
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,301
Atlantic and,
and as a consequence of the book and 

1641
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:44,240
what you hope will happen,
like say over the next year if we're 

1642
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:44,730
going to be optimistic about where we're
headed,

1643
01:27:44,731 --> 01:27:45,550
what's going to happen?

1644
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:51,470
So I felt for the last two years that 
we're kind of in an emperor's new 

1645
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,880
clothes situation where most people who 
are paying attention,

1646
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:59,460
most people are involved in universities
or an education realized that something 

1647
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,610
wrong,
but they don't understand what it is and

1648
01:28:00,611 --> 01:28:05,611
nobody wants to appear insensitive.
The people don't want to stand up and 

1649
01:28:05,611 --> 01:28:06,410
critique if it seems that you're pushing
back against it,

1650
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,770
against the historical marginalized 
groups in particular.

1651
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:12,250
So there's been.
So university administrators,

1652
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,770
we spoke to a lot of college presidents.
They're overwhelmingly,

1653
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,660
what I would call it,
liberal left,

1654
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:21,690
not illiberal.
I don't know of any college presidents 

1655
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:22,240
who are illiberal,
but they're often afraid to stand up for

1656
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,890
what you've observed you to Evergreen 
State University.

1657
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,430
So.
Yes,

1658
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,170
that's right.
That's right.

1659
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:29,370
Yeah,
that's right.

1660
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,200
So there's been a lot of desire to 
change,

1661
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:38,250
a lot of desire to restore some sense of
ordering community on campus that we can

1662
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:40,440
do our work and our teaching.
Um,

1663
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:41,990
and,
but,

1664
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,360
but I'm hopeful that our book will do,
is give everyone a common set of 

1665
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,351
concepts and,
and sort of a look into how this thing 

1666
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:54,621
plays out if you,
if you don't do anything to stop it 

1667
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:54,621
going down this rabbit hole.
Um,

1668
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:58,520
my hope for the book is that the 
parenting stuff is,

1669
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:01,440
is new.
That is a lot of people have been what's

1670
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:06,441
going on on campus,
but they don't realize this is now 

1671
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:07,350
happening in high schools.
And so my hope is that every,

1672
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:12,710
every school principal from elementary 
school through high school and every 

1673
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:16,101
college president will get a copy of the
book in the mail or given to them by a 

1674
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,430
donor,
Jordan,

1675
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,700
Jordan's large audience.
I hope that you will buy a copy of the 

1676
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:26,961
book and give it to the principal of 
your kids' elementary school and 

1677
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:26,961
certainly

1678
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,290
maybe we can put that in the description
as well.

1679
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,060
Makes a great gift to the people who are
educating your children.

1680
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:34,710
Right?
I'll,

1681
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,600
I'll write that down right now.

1682
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:42,710
Reaching parents.
So that's always the first constituency 

1683
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:42,710
we talk about because,
you know,

1684
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,750
we hear it from parents over and over 
again as parents ourselves.

1685
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:51,050
There's this kind of like there's a 
sense that something's really going 

1686
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:55,461
wrong in k through 12 education.
Certainty there's something more going 

1687
01:29:55,461 --> 01:29:57,510
on than just the process of parenting 
where most people feel kind of.

1688
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,830
That seems like a lot of parents feel 
sort of helpless because they don't have

1689
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:06,831
that pluralistic ignorance problem.
They don't know that everybody else 

1690
01:30:06,831 --> 01:30:10,790
having the same problems and as soon as 
you actually get the conversation 

1691
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:10,790
started,
if we can get to parents,

1692
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:10,890
we,
uh,

1693
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,330
we have a real fighting chance.

1694
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,610
Okay.
Alright.

1695
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,490
Well,
um,

1696
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,480
what,
what do you think?

1697
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:22,630
Are you optimistic or pessimistic about 
where this is going at the moment?

1698
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,880
No kidding.
That's exactly.

1699
01:30:25,881 --> 01:30:30,881
You hit a little bit of both.
I'm very pessimistic about the national 

1700
01:30:30,881 --> 01:30:34,891
situation.
I think polarization is going to get 

1701
01:30:34,891 --> 01:30:36,811
worse for awhile while,
and so I think we have to think about 

1702
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:39,400
how do we adapt our institutions to life
in an increasingly polarized country.

1703
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,800
So if know politics is,
is dominating everything and it's 

1704
01:30:45,281 --> 01:30:50,281
getting nastier and Nastier,
it would be great if when you go into a 

1705
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:50,281
restaurant,
you don't have to think about,

1706
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:54,140
is this a Democrat restaurant?
When you go into buy a pair of sneakers,

1707
01:30:54,141 --> 01:30:56,270
you don't have to think about,
is this a democratic pair of sneakers,

1708
01:30:56,271 --> 01:31:01,271
a Republican pair of sneakers?
So we maybe go into the rope to 

1709
01:31:01,271 --> 01:31:01,271
everything is polarized,
everything's political.

1710
01:31:01,271 --> 01:31:03,830
That'd be terrible if universities to 
come to that,

1711
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:07,000
if this is a Democrat university or 
public,

1712
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,670
that would be terrible.
Um,

1713
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,160
so I think on the national level I'm 
very pessimistic,

1714
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:15,960
but I think that there is enough 
recognition that we're all exhausted.

1715
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:18,270
This is,
this is out of control,

1716
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:23,480
but I think we will have a,
it'll be possible to get a constituency 

1717
01:31:23,701 --> 01:31:26,820
to say our elementary schools or middle 
schools or high schools.

1718
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:28,710
And universities,
they have work to do,

1719
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,990
um,
uh,

1720
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:32,640
we need to reform what we're doing in 
ways that are better for the kids.

1721
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:35,040
We all love our kids,
we all want our kids to be resilient.

1722
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,880
So I like Greg,
I'm very optimistic that,

1723
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,350
that the trend towards overprotective 
parenting,

1724
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,590
which has just been continuing on and 
on.

1725
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:47,810
I'm very optimistic that,
that will reverse once people see those 

1726
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,380
graphs once people and you talk to 
parents of teenagers,

1727
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:52,560
even if their kid isn't depressed,
seven of their kids' friends,

1728
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:54,030
depressed or anxious.

1729
01:31:55,180 --> 01:32:00,180
Okay.
So let me ask you about that a little 

1730
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:00,960
bit and maybe we'll end with this.
Um,

1731
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:06,720
I've been trying to figure out why this 
overprotectiveness epidemic has emerged.

1732
01:32:06,941 --> 01:32:11,941
And so I took the social,
psychological root of analysis instead 

1733
01:32:11,941 --> 01:32:16,351
of the psychological.
Because I do know you should look at 

1734
01:32:16,351 --> 01:32:18,961
situational factors before you look at 
app in personality factors.

1735
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:21,250
Let's say generally speaking,
well,

1736
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:24,310
here's some demographic trends.
Um,

1737
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:30,330
fewer kids.
So maybe parents don't make their kids 

1738
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:31,830
resilient.
Maybe siblings do,

1739
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,300
you know,
because there's a lot of,

1740
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,100
there's a lot of uh,
uh,

1741
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:41,580
what would you call status competition 
between siblings and if you're special 

1742
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:47,490
or unreasonable,
[inaudible] your siblings are going to 

1743
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:48,070
have a field day with you.
And so,

1744
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:53,130
you know,
maybe we can't raise kids that are 

1745
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:55,231
resilient unless they have three 
brothers and sisters or something like 

1746
01:32:55,231 --> 01:32:55,231
that.

1747
01:32:55,231 --> 01:32:59,210
That makes a lot of sense.
But my recollection was elicits a cela 

1748
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:00,970
what was it,
the guy who wrote birth order,

1749
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:06,250
what was that book?
My recollection is that the effects of 

1750
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,940
birth out are actually very small.
And so whether you're a first or last,

1751
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,760
whether you're an only child or not.
So research one back very far,

1752
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:17,761
those effects are pretty small.
So I would not put this big change on 

1753
01:33:17,761 --> 01:33:20,920
the factor of declining families because
you don't have siblings rather declining

1754
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:23,500
families means there just aren't that 
many kids in the neighborhood.

1755
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,150
Yeah.
Well that's the other issue.

1756
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:26,920
Sure,
sure,

1757
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:28,810
sure.
Because more significant.

1758
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:34,630
So then next thing,
next thing might be older parents know 

1759
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:41,220
we don't know how optimally stupid you 
should be when you're a,

1760
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:46,490
when you're a parent,
and it might be that you might need to 

1761
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:49,251
be somewhat narcissistically entranced 
with your own life to ignore your 

1762
01:33:49,251 --> 01:33:52,740
children enough to allow them to develop
independent resilience,

1763
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,100
you know,
and if you're,

1764
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,520
if now let's say you don't have a child 
until you're,

1765
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,640
well let's say 40,
you only have one or two,

1766
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:04,641
so they're pretty damn precious and 
you'd been waiting a long time and now 

1767
01:34:04,641 --> 01:34:08,301
you're more conservative because you're 
older because you will be and you have 

1768
01:34:08,301 --> 01:34:12,210
endless resources to devote to this 
extraordinarily valuable individual.

1769
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,310
So,
so if it,

1770
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:18,450
if it's,
if it's the consequence of it switch and

1771
01:34:18,451 --> 01:34:20,280
demographics and,
and,

1772
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,520
and older parents,
then it's going to be a harder thing to 

1773
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,950
rectify as a consequence of 
transformation of attitude.

1774
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,990
Nicholas is major,
major theory on this stuff.

1775
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,100
And at the same time,
you know,

1776
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:38,100
you have to say some things that really 
have changed.

1777
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:42,160
And definitely what first,
I'm a first generation American.

1778
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:45,770
I'm the,
uh,

1779
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,240
but the idea that there's this sort of 
like a,

1780
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:53,580
of the stratification in the US in terms
of income is getting so dramatic and the

1781
01:34:53,581 --> 01:34:58,340
way you can get to that life raft is 
getting into a princeton or Stanford

1782
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:00,030
or Harvard,
um,

1783
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,270
that,
that's not entirely in people's heads,

1784
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:05,480
but unfortunately the way we thought 
that,

1785
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:09,640
the best way to do that is to build 
these sort of rocket ship hyper invested

1786
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:14,650
in.
We have two kids and you treat them 

1787
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,661
both,
like keep seeking missiles and you 

1788
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:17,330
completely eliminate any autonomy over 
their lives.

1789
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:19,700
They get up at six and they're scheduled
until they go to bed.

1790
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,080
Um,
it turns out that this is visibly 

1791
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,080
dysfunctional.
At the same time,

1792
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:29,771
it's why we interviewed Julie Haines who
wrote a book called how to raise an 

1793
01:35:29,771 --> 01:35:29,771
adult about how,
you know,

1794
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,920
freshmen are showing up at Stanford.
I'm depressed partially because they 

1795
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,590
have been no sense of locus of control 
of their life.

1796
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:42,420
So I think there is a really stunning 
success that we found in researching the

1797
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:47,501
book.
It's no surprise that meant if you 

1798
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:49,781
compare it,
if you go back to the 19 fifties and 

1799
01:35:49,781 --> 01:35:51,791
sixties,
look at how men spend their time and 

1800
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:53,930
today it's no surprise that men are 
spending more time in childcare and more

1801
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:54,680
time with their kids.

1802
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:56,300
That's great.
We all think that's great.

1803
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:01,750
What do you think has happened to women?
Women were very rarely working in the 

1804
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:05,381
fifties and sixties and so look,
the number of hours they spent two and 

1805
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:07,871
childcare involve their children back 
then getting us going up or down since 

1806
01:36:07,871 --> 01:36:08,810
the fifties or sixties.
Now they most women are working.

1807
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:13,580
Answer one more time with their kids and
there are very few kids now.

1808
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:18,850
So you have mom and dad both spending 
more time with their one or two kids 

1809
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:24,270
supervising over investing.
They're not a lot of kids out in the 

1810
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:24,950
neighborhood and investing poorly.
And that's important is right there.

1811
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,110
That's right.
Because we're investing in a what?

1812
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:30,140
A net zero calls.
Concerted cultivation.

1813
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:31,670
We have the two,
the two.

1814
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,360
Here's another.
Here's another conundrum.

1815
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:40,830
So one of the things that struck me is 
that a lot of this gender play that you 

1816
01:36:40,871 --> 01:36:45,871
see gender roleplay that you see in 
among adolescents now,

1817
01:36:45,911 --> 01:36:48,280
older adolescents and young adults in 
university.

1818
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:53,281
So the gender bender and gender fluidity
a games and I'm calling them games for a

1819
01:36:54,641 --> 01:36:59,641
reason.
They remind me of pretend play within 

1820
01:36:59,641 --> 01:37:01,480
insistence by the player that everyone 
joins the game.

1821
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:06,510
And I've been thinking,
well maybe we're seeing a delayed 

1822
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:10,150
reaction to the eradication of fantasy 
play in early childhood as a consequence

1823
01:37:10,151 --> 01:37:12,370
of the introduction of technological 
devices.

1824
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:17,910
Because you know,
the developmental psychologists know 

1825
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,480
very well that children have to engage 
in a lot of fantasy play.

1826
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:25,050
And then if you introduce technology 
that that interferes with that or 

1827
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:27,880
supersedes if then the fantasy play 
doesn't do occurred.

1828
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:31,300
You're playing with different roles when
you're engaged in fantasy play.

1829
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,280
So I'm also wondering,
you know,

1830
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,610
because I noticed even when I had kids,
which is no for a long time ago,

1831
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:40,990
often when I took them to the houses of 
other people with kids,

1832
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,440
instead of letting the kids go off and 
caused a bit of trouble and then settle 

1833
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,840
into a spontaneous fantasy play episode,
they'd put on a video,

1834
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:56,370
but now that's like 20 times is bad 
because all kids have access to endless 

1835
01:37:56,941 --> 01:38:00,420
electronic devices and we don't know 
what that's doing to the early childhood

1836
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,690
play and so well.
So anyways,

1837
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:08,691
those are some of the sociological 
forces that I thought might be at work 

1838
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:12,170
that are driving this hype of 
protectiveness and if it isn't obvious 

1839
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:15,351
to see how to reverse them because 
they're not happening consciously in 

1840
01:38:15,421 --> 01:38:16,290
some sense.
Right.

1841
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:21,291
It's not like everybody decided that 
they were going to hyper protect their 

1842
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:21,291
children.

1843
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:25,650
Yeah.
But I think social norms are very 

1844
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,221
powerful and if everybody else acts like
letting your kid walk a dog is 

1845
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:33,891
dangerous,
you'll be less likely to let your kid 

1846
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:34,410
walk the dog.
It should be possible to reverse that.

1847
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:37,220
What we're hoping will emerge from this 
book and our discussions,

1848
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,590
the book is the norm that if you're not 
letting your kid out,

1849
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,410
you're harming your kid.
Almost like a vitamin deficiency.

1850
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:49,010
I'd like to know if doctor story,
if pediatricians and the pediatricians 

1851
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:53,181
just put out a big report on the 
importance of play at kids need a lot 

1852
01:38:53,181 --> 01:38:57,321
more play than they're getting vitamin P
and how much vitamin P did your kid get 

1853
01:38:57,511 --> 01:38:59,910
today?
And parents and vitamin D is not.

1854
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:01,500
It doesn't count if you were there with 
them.

1855
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,230
So,
um,

1856
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:10,610
so if we start,
if pediatricians aren't asking them how 

1857
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,580
much vitamin peg kid get less and only 
tell me about the unsupervised time.

1858
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:16,370
So,
so we look at the idea because you know,

1859
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,410
so your point about the shrinking 
families is,

1860
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:24,411
is right and that's irreversible.
We're never going to go back to large 

1861
01:39:24,411 --> 01:39:24,411
families.
We have to adapt to that.

1862
01:39:24,411 --> 01:39:26,100
And if you really want your kid to be 
successful,

1863
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,630
he'll back off.
That's the idea.

1864
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:28,350
We have to get across.

1865
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:35,490
Look,
your kid's going to have to encounter 

1866
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,580
the full tragedy of life as they mature 
and become adults.

1867
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:42,090
You're trying to do what you're trying 
to do.

1868
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,510
I mean,
there are all sorts of things.

1869
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:50,080
So when Nisha said what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger,

1870
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:55,530
the principle is true,
but it's not literally true and the 

1871
01:39:56,020 --> 01:40:01,020
research on adverse childhood 
experiences and we talk a fair amount 

1872
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:05,960
about advocating for that,
but certainly for goodness sakes,

1873
01:40:09,401 --> 01:40:14,401
you know,
the ability to get in fights with other 

1874
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:17,281
kids and resolved among themselves.
We got rid of that and now we have a 

1875
01:40:17,741 --> 01:40:19,450
generation that's looking upwards.

1876
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:27,140
Say whatever doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

1877
01:40:27,141 --> 01:40:30,670
So he certainly knew that something.
Right?

1878
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,800
So it's a matter of optimal exposure to 
challenge and it's by challenging your 

1879
01:40:36,501 --> 01:40:41,501
kid's not five,
protecting them that you make them 

1880
01:40:41,501 --> 01:40:42,710
resilient and they need to be resilient 
because life is actually difficult.

1881
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:44,350
And so,
you know,

1882
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:49,360
one of the things that's been gratifying
to me too is during my lectures I've 

1883
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,460
been telling people that the idea that 
they're okay the way they are,

1884
01:40:52,461 --> 01:40:54,820
especially if young is an appalling 
idea.

1885
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,650
What they could be concentrating on is 
who they could be.

1886
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:05,650
One of the really positive elements to 
the notion of optimal challenges,

1887
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:07,110
but it's really,
um,

1888
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:12,930
it's encouraging for people to know that
you're willing to let them take a risk 

1889
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:16,900
because you have enough faith in their 
ability to learn and prevailed that,

1890
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,790
that supersedes the risk.

1891
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,760
All right.
Well thank you guys very much 

1892
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,460
appreciated the discussion.
We'll get this up as soon as I get it 

1893
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:34,351
edited,
which shouldn't be too long and if you 

1894
01:41:34,351 --> 01:41:36,841
would be so kind as to send me all the 
url links you'd like me to post in the 

1895
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:41,311
description,
then I would be more than happy to do 

1896
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:44,341
that.
And good luck with your continued sales 

1897
01:41:44,341 --> 01:41:46,360
of your book and with all your other 
endeavors as well.

1898
01:41:46,361 --> 01:41:51,361
And hopefully a good sense will prevail 
and we can do something to reverse this 

1899
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:57,781
polarization and to,
and also maybe to reduce the safety 

1900
01:41:58,031 --> 01:42:01,770
culture on in the education system.
That would really be something.

01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:05,590
Thank you,
Jordan.

1902
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,750
Jordan.
Good to see you both.
