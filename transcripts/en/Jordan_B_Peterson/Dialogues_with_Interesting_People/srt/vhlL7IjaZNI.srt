1
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,170
So I'm here tonight talking to Howard 
Bloom,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
who's a fascinating person and an author
of many books and a polymath of sorts 

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,720
and we've known each other by electronic
communication for quite a long time.

4
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:31,690
It's,
it's something exceeding a decade,

5
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,270
but we've never met either in person or 
electronically by video until now.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,360
And I'm Howard is definitely,
well he's a singular sort of person and 

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,750
he has a very broad range of knowledge 
as broad as anyone I've ever encountered

8
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,751
I would say.
And so what I'm going to do first is 

9
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,151
turn this over to him so that he can 
tell you a little bit about himself and 

10
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,181
about what he's done.
And then we're going to talk about his 

11
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,391
newest book,
which is called how I accidentally 

12
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,401
started the sixties and then.
Well we're going to see where it goes 

13
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:02,401
from there.
So Howard,

14
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,190
thanks for showing up here and let's,
let's see where we can go.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,040
So why don't you tell everybody about 
yourself.

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,230
Well,
it's a pleasure to see you in person 

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,230
because I think it's been about 14 
years,

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,410
maybe 15 years that we've known each 
other,

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,580
put together a science of the soul 
initiative a long time ago.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,750
And,
and you were one of those kinds of 

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:25,750
enough to sign on.
Um,

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:25,750
but,
uh,

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,261
I am the author of six books.
The first book is called the Lucifer 

24
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:33,861
principle.
I scientific expedition into the forces 

25
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:34,410
of history and even though it's about 25
years old,

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,670
um,
people are buying it because it feels 

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,910
like it was written yesterday for 
tomorrow and people call it their Bible.

28
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:47,911
The second book is global brain,
the evolution of mass mind from the Big 

29
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,531
Bang to the 21st century.
And the office of the Secretary of 

30
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,720
defense in the United States,
the reform based on one of the,

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
on that book and brought in people from 
the State Department that the Energy 

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Department,
Darpa,

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,110
IBM,
and Mit.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Um,
the third book is called the genius of 

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,500
the beast.
A radical revision of capitalism.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,770
I preferred its original title,
which was reinventing capitalist,

37
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,970
importing soul,
the machine.

38
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,870
And that book,
the man who runs Dubai,

39
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,780
the shake who runs Dubai,
a named array source,

40
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,850
after one of the,
after that book,

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,910
the,
uh,

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
his former minister of development who's
under buys ruling council and runs a 

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,690
$33,000,000,000
sovereign real estate company that built

44
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,691
the tallest building in the world,
went in front of the Arabian business 

45
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,181
and Economic Forum and told them there 
was a book that I particularly resonate 

46
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:41,881
with.
It's the genius of the beast and it 

47
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,581
contains the future of Dubai.
And he proceeded to read passages from 

48
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,881
that book and Dr a Dot p Dot j Columbia,
11th president of India said that that 

49
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,000
book is a visionary creation and this is
despite the fact that the sheikh runs do

50
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,350
by his former minister of development.

51
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,000
And Dr Robert Bull j column are all 
Muslims and I'm a Zionist atheist.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,700
So if there's any sign of hope for peace
in this world,

53
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,670
that's it.
I've done lots and lots of other things.

54
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,671
Just a few months ago,
I co founded and shared the Asian space 

55
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:16,651
technology summit with a large groups of
representatives from China,

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,290
the Chinese Academy of Space Technology,
and from,

57
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,180
uh,
England space program.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,330
I've done the weirdest variety of things
you've ever seen in your life.

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,550
Oh,
and I should not forget,

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,330
once upon a time I found it.
I knew nothing about popular culture.

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,330
I found that the biggest pr firm in the 
music industry,

62
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,600
I use my scientific tools since it's my 
background is science,

63
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,310
my life science,
my bones,

64
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,110
and my flesh,
our science.

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,440
And it became the most successful 
theater on the firm and the record 

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,050
industry.
So I worked with Michael Jackson,

67
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,920
prince,
Bob Marley,

68
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,930
but middle or ACDC Aerosmith,
kiss queen,

69
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,370
run DMC,
Billy Joel,

70
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,240
Paul,
Simon,

71
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,020
Peter,
Gabriel,

72
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,970
David Byrne,
run DMC,

73
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,830
grandmaster flash and the furious five.

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,190
Little things like that can't really 
only too crazy biography you'd think 

75
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,270
you'd have to think that someone is 
making that up if you didn't know it was

76
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:09,271
true.
And then you also accidentally started 

77
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:09,271
the sixties apparently.
Yes.

78
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:12,100
And it was reading that book about a 
week ago and thought,

79
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,450
what did you think of it?
Oh,

80
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,910
I thought it was very funny.
It was,

81
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,840
it was,
it was.

82
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,930
I also thought it was remarkable that 
you managed to have a foreword by or I 

83
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,640
wasn't a former and I don't think it was
commentary by Timothy leary.

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,930
Yes.
Well,

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,460
let me tell you how that came about.
There I was a.

86
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,300
well it was about 1981 and I started to 
go back to my science.

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
Yes,
I was running low successful pr from the

88
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,660
music industry.
Yes.

89
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,190
We were still on the ess.
Yes.

90
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:44,191
We were establishing,
taking unknowns like prince and 

91
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:47,011
establishing them as major stars or Joan
Jett who've been turned down by 23 

92
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,360
record companies and we made her double 
platinum in a year and a half.

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Um,
but I finally got a little time for you 

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:54,680
to go back to my science.
And then,

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:54,790
um,
uh,

96
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,810
I was taking a bunch of journalists out 
to long island to see reo speedwagon.

97
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,100
And a bunch of them said,
bloom.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,960
All these ideas.
You keep talking about us.

99
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:08,800
You need to write a book and one of them
will talk me under his wing and actually

100
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,120
mentored me,
Timothy White,

101
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,580
who wrote for the Associated Press and 
rolling stone.

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,020
Um,
so I started working on a book in 1984,

103
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,740
about 1988.
I had gotten up and running and written.

104
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:25,741
The first chapter is on a vacation and 
then I came down for two things 

105
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,170
happened.
First,

106
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,200
I really needed to get out of publicity 
in the music industry.

107
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:34,201
I have satisfied all of my intellectual 
questions because there were a set of 

108
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,660
questions I was answering,
answering what are the mass exhilaration

109
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:42,250
for the mass exodus sees the mass 
emotions that are the forces of history,

110
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,080
that power historical change.

111
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,410
That's what I was after.
And you see that in miniature with the 

112
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,590
Beatles or with Michael Jackson or 
prince.

113
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,010
So I gotten this far as I could.
I mean youtube would approach me to 

114
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,560
represent them.
I wasn't interested.

115
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,790
I'm Mick Jagger,
had sent an emissary talk about 

116
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,950
representing him.
I wasn't interested.

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I'd been through all of this already.
Let me ask you a couple of questions 

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:07,960
there.
So,

119
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,530
I mean,
the first question would be,

120
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,150
I think,
how,

121
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,510
what is it that you had done that had 
prepared you for that and how and how 

122
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,210
did you manage it?
So I guess that's two questions,

123
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:21,440
but also what did you,
what did you learn from all of that?

124
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,850
These are very great questions to 
prepare me for this Martin Gardner from 

125
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,570
the time I was 10,
I was reading two books a day,

126
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,120
um,
my teachers say to me because I was 

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,120
reading a book under the desk at all 
times and never,

128
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,820
ever paid attention to them and many of 
these science books and I read the 

129
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,661
scientific American from cover to cover 
and Martin Gardner who is a 

130
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,650
mathematician,
had a column called Mathematical Games.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,110
And I learned what I know from 
mathematical games.

132
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,380
It taught me certain techniques I was 
able to bring in.

133
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:53,900
So the record industry.
So that's a hell of a stretch.

134
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,310
I mean singular story.
So how.

135
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,220
Okay,
so elaborate on that.

136
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,490
Well,
what it taught is how to look for 

137
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,621
correlations and more than a 
mathematical techniques for finding 

138
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:10,691
correlations.
It gave you a gut feel of what a 

139
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,871
correlation looks like so that you 
didn't have to go off to a world of 

140
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,020
mathematics that was so arcane,
that had no relationship to reality.

141
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,530
You could take the search for 
correlations into the real world.

142
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,890
Um,
I listened to music as obsessively from 

143
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,981
the time I was about 10 years old,
my uncle and I used to stand next to a 

144
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:34,151
huge old burl would radio that was as 
tall as I was at the time and it had a 

145
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,330
giant speaker in Jordan in those days,
12 inch speakers.

146
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,820
Nobody to receive wellborn speakers,
but it had one.

147
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,210
And we've listened to the classical 
music station in Canada because we were 

148
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,511
in buffalo on the border and we would 
compete to see who can identify a piece 

149
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:55,241
of music by its first four notes.
While often we can both identify the 

150
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,300
piece of music by first note.
However,

151
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,610
it was all classical music.
It was rough,

152
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,600
Montereau,
bartow,

153
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,950
Beethoven,
Stravinsky.

154
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,370
I'm Mozart,
stuff like that.

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,110
So I can't really say that I was 
properly prepared because I was hated by

156
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,510
the other kids my age in Buffalo,
New York,

157
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,490
and my parents didn't have any time for 
me.

158
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,710
So I was an outcast and the the crowd of
people that shut me out,

159
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,100
listen to popular music.
So popular music.

160
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,600
What started is with Elvis Presley,
what was around before Elvis Presley and

161
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,990
then moved on.
That was alien music for me and I wasn't

162
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,000
the least bit interested in it and.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But in the 1970 [inaudible],
late 19 sixties and early 19 seventies,

164
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,420
I knew I had fellowships at for Grad 
schools.

165
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm in what is now called neuroscience.
At that point,

166
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,450
it was a do it yourself proposition.
I was going to have to take courses in 

167
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,620
the med school at Columbia and flipped 
them together with courses in psychology

168
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,860
at Columbia and make my own neuroscience
because there were no neuroscience 

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,440
courses,
but I had four fellowships to do this 

170
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,370
and I realized that Grad school would be
Auschwitz for the mind.

171
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,430
Why?
Because I was fascinated by these 

172
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,341
ecstatic mass passions that young people
that boost people out of themselves,

173
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,870
but lift them into something much bigger
than themselves,

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,200
a deep need that every human has to feel
at some point a part of something much 

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,371
bigger than his or herself,
and those are the mass passions that 

176
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:22,980
create historical change.

177
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,050
They are the forces of history and I was
not going to get to study mass passions.

178
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,710
I was not going to get to make contact 
with mass fashions.

179
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,080
If I went onto win academic career,
I'd be spending the rest of my life 

180
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,370
giving paper and Pencil tests to 22 
college students in exchange for a 

181
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,370
psychology credit.
Now,

182
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:46,371
exactly how much ecstatic experience are
you going to see in a classroom of that 

183
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,320
sort with type paper and pencil tests?
Zero.

184
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,680
The entire phenomena I wanted to 
understand would not be there anywhere 

185
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,611
in my life,
so I took advantage of the fact that I 

186
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,461
had basically been kidnapped and my 
junior year by the poet in residence at 

187
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:05,910
Nyu who had said he'd said,
look low when everybody will hear us out

188
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,680
of the room.
Close the door.

189
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,570
I know I need to talk to you.
Well Jordan,

190
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,010
that means a balling out,
right?

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,490
So I waited until everybody left.
I shut the door.

192
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:19,491
I sat down in the your about to be 
balled out chair and the poet and 

193
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:20,180
residents said to me,
look,

194
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,860
last year I asked you to be on the staff
of Literary magazine.

195
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,090
You didn't even show up this year.
You are the literary magazine.

196
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,600
You don't even have a faculty advisor.
The minute you walk out that door,

197
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:35,601
your it now walk out that door.
And I walked out the door looking 

198
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,010
totally baffled because I hated literary
magazines.

199
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,140
They were the most boring things you 
would ever seen.

200
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,410
You could have a group of Vikings,
each of whom had drunk a quart of Ale,

201
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,930
um,
bond funking up against the wall and 

202
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,721
bonking each other.
And if you put a literary magazine and 

203
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,930
the room,
that Pale blue cover and the mist chosen

204
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:59,931
type would make either put everybody to 
sleep instantly what would drive them 

205
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:00,660
out of the room.

206
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,590
So I looked very confused in a student,
walked up to me and said,

207
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,540
you look troubled about something.
Can I help you?

208
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,210
Why don't I take you down for a cup of 
coffee?

209
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:14,211
I didn't know what a cup of coffee once 
I had grown up with lab rats and and 

210
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,840
hamsters.
I'm not with human beings,

211
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,140
but I followed him obediently.
Now listers.

212
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,540
And when we sat down at the coffee shop 
and I ordered water and he ordered 

213
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,540
coffee,
he said,

214
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,320
if you could do anything you want with 
this magazine,

215
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:29,110
what would it be?
And I said a picture book so that,

216
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:31,860
that Jordan,
I've learned that question,

217
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:36,861
that question is a very valuable tool.
So I turned it into experimental and 

218
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:40,080
graphics magazine and it was a wild hit 
and it was a wild hit,

219
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,200
not just on campus where they doubled 
our budget for the second issue.

220
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,620
It was a wild hit in the art directorial
community.

221
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I think you covered that in,
in how I started accidentally started 

222
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,220
the 66.
I think.

223
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,210
So what that allowed me to do,
um,

224
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,460
is when I,
and my wife was putting pressure on me,

225
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,910
she had had a previous husband who was 
assuming she was tired of having student

226
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,560
husbands.
She made it clear and it kind of sort of

227
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,910
voucher a way that if I went off to Grad
School at Columbia,

228
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,180
I could kiss her goodbye.
Not a nice idea after three years of 

229
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,480
marriage.
So with all these pressures on me,

230
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:21,481
um,
I threw my lot in with the artists that 

231
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,240
I had assembled for this magazine.
We,

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,220
we formed an art studio and the first 
year we are in $75 a piece,

233
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,940
which is,
which is just enough to get you food and

234
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,880
possibly a little bit of shelter in New 
York City.

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,360
But eventually I made the cover of art 
direction magazine.

236
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,370
I invented a new animation technique for
NBC TV and most important by studio did 

237
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:49,051
all of the graphics for ABC Seven FM 
stations at a time when there was a 

238
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:53,821
revolution taking place in radio.
There was this brand new form of radio 

239
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,320
called rock radio or album radio or 
progressive radio.

240
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,300
And with ditch witch,
just rocky,

241
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:03,301
so it actually play what they want it.
And I was there because ABC seven FM 

242
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:08,281
stations all converted to this new 
progressive format and they used me,

243
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:13,411
I my art studio to get that across to 
kids all over the ice.

244
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,050
So yeah,
you will respond to all that once I got 

245
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,221
to thank you for that because I listened
to Lee Memorial and FM stations a lot 

246
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,200
when I was a kid.
And so a lot.

247
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,390
I mean lots of people did,
but I didn't know you were.

248
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,000
You had a hand in that.
So that was very good thing.

249
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,390
Well I thank you for the thanks.
I had a hand in that and they abc asked 

250
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:38,581
me to form an advertising agency to 
handle all of their advertising and 

251
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:43,320
Jordan.
I didn't want to get involved in time 

252
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,320
buying.
That was just too dry for me.

253
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,400
But because I was walking into.
We did one other thing.

254
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:49,420
There was a new magazine with a bunch of
Harvard kids.

255
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,500
It was a monthly version of the annual 
Harvard Lampoon.

256
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,890
It was called the National Lampoon and 
my art studio art directed the first 

257
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,170
seven issues that.
But it was ABC pgl roof.

258
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,220
His start there,
right?

259
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,210
Yes,
exactly.

260
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:09,211
And I acted in a Michael O'donoghue 
script that we did for the Evergreen 

261
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,090
Review,
um,

262
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:13,030
which was leading a Bohemian publication
of the time.

263
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,430
It's art director was one of those 
people who had called me,

264
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,750
um,
after we saw the Washington Square 

265
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,161
review,
the student literary and Graphics 

266
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:23,161
magazine that,
that I've been putting together,

267
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
but they,
the promotion person at ABC was 

268
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,261
extremely kind to me.
And every time I walked in I'd hear 

269
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:34,480
Carole King or James Taylor who were the
biggest people in rock music at the time

270
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,680
on the speakers on the floor.
And she would do things like,

271
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,690
I mean,
she was just clue me in.

272
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:44,020
She was bringing me into the rock and 
roll world one day,

273
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,250
for example,
she said,

274
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:50,251
we're going to have,
we're going to have a live performance 

275
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,980
to studio b by a penis.
And I'm

276
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,600
wondering,
wondering,

277
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,430
I give you two tickets.
So I took her two tickets.

278
00:14:55,431 --> 00:15:00,431
I went down to my art studio on Fourth 
Street and second avenue in the East 

279
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:03,140
village and my,
my leading artists was just a brilliant,

280
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,230
brilliant a cartoonist,
and I invited him to come to this event 

281
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,350
with me.
We went to the event.

282
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,560
The Piano's took to the stage.
My artists sat next to me and from the 

283
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,770
minute the pianist played his first 
cord,

284
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,860
my artists was on his feet going,
wow,

285
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:22,580
you have the yahoo.
And totally embarrassing me.

286
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:27,581
I mean,
I wanted to crawl under the seat and 

287
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,981
become absolutely invisible.
The pianist on stage was out in the 

288
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:34,721
genre.
What I failed to get was that my artist 

289
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:38,740
was giving Elton John the energy he 
needed to do the very kind of expanded 

290
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,960
performance that takes you out of 
yourself and makes you feel part of 

291
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:43,960
something bigger than yourself.

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,020
That I was trapped trying to track down 
using things like William James,

293
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:52,580
the varieties of religious experience 
and taking advantage of my,

294
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,100
my special vantage point.
Um,

295
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,650
how,
why do you think,

296
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,340
you know,
you're,

297
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,440
you,
there's cars,

298
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,480
there's a kind of a contradictory 
narrative that runs through that story,

299
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,460
which is that,
you know,

300
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,390
when you're a kid you were sort of 
isolated,

301
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,150
you were booking more scientifically 
oriented,

302
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,450
but at the same time you obviously had 
a,

303
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,680
what,
what would you call it,

304
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:17,681
a,
a feel for ecstatic experience and like 

305
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:21,100
was that,
was that a consequence of your 

306
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,021
participation in the counterculture in 
the sixties or was that something that 

307
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,440
emerged even before that?
It was something that emerged probably 

308
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,621
between the age of 10 and 12.
It probably came from the fact that I 

309
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,620
was suffering serious social 
deprivation.

310
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,070
I really,
I had one friend at a time and that's 

311
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,011
about as much as I had and I was,
I was an indispensable figure when it 

312
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,000
came time to beat somebody up because I 
was the target.

313
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,100
Um,
how.

314
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:48,101
Okay.
So That's interesting too because that 

315
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:48,101
also,
I mean,

316
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,140
it isn't obvious how you get from that 
position to being interested in ecstatic

317
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,960
experiences per se.
So how,

318
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,970
what,
what's the connection there with your 

319
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:57,970
rather like,
what would you call it?

320
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,030
Isolated childhood experiences,
do you think?

321
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,970
I mean you said it had something partly 
to do with music,

322
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
which makes perfect,
perfect sense to me because music is 

323
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,300
almost a,
what would you say?

324
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,250
It's an unerring gateway into that 
ecstatic experience,

325
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,030
right?
And for,

326
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,060
for very complex reasons.
I'd like to talk to you about that a 

327
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,060
little bit,
but it,

328
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,910
it isn't obvious why someone who was 
more scientifically oriented say would 

329
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,200
also make that leap over to the more 
mystical end of things.

330
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,150
And then of course pursue it through pop
culture.

331
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,980
So you laid out your surprising 
involvement,

332
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,020
literary magazine,
your transformation of that into what 

333
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,670
was essentially a visual art 
publication,

334
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,030
your entry into the world of radio and 
then into rock.

335
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:41,330
I don't want to lose that thread because
that also leads to your pr firm,

336
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,350
and I presume we're getting to that,
but what deconditioned or anything that 

337
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,450
you can put your finger on you,
you associated there also with like 

338
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,960
being physically bullied and being a 
social outcast,

339
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,360
but why did that give you the hunger for
that experience,

340
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,110
for that ecstatic?

341
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Well,
remember back to the days of the 19 

342
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,760
sixties in the 19 seventies when sleep 
deprivation was a new discovery and then

343
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,810
back in the 19 nineties and early two 
thousands,

344
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,430
Jaak Panksepp took that a step further 
and in his studies of rapid behavior,

345
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,700
he discovered that if he deprived a 
bunch of child Rhett's,

346
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,200
little rats,
baby rats,

347
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,120
if he deprives them of the ability to 
play and didn't give them access to each

348
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:26,121
other as peers until they become adults.
They suffered play deprivation and they 

349
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:32,301
spent just as much time playing with 
each other as adults as they would have 

350
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:36,250
spent playing with each other.
Have they been allowed to as children?

351
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Okay,
so I want to make a quick lateral move 

352
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,500
there and we'll get back to that.
You know,

353
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,920
I've been thinking about these,
these strange,

354
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,950
modern manifestations of identity 
fantasy or that's what it looks to me 

355
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,450
like these people who are playing out,
what do they call them,

356
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:56,451
other kids,
and playing with their identities and a 

357
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,780
really fantasy based way.
Sometimes I wonder if part of that isn't

358
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,210
a consequence of play deprivation in 
childhood.

359
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,210
Well,
that sounds.

360
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,820
That sounds like a distinct possibility.
But remember,

361
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,050
Herman has said that there are somewhere
deep dark in the mind.

362
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,140
There is a closet with 10,000
hidden personalities.

363
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,980
One of the things that I discovered were
going to get out of chronological order,

364
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,220
but one of the things that I discovered 
when I first became full time involved 

365
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,520
with rock and roll was the story of 
Alice Cooper.

366
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,850
And the story of Alice Cooper reveal 
something about the question that you 

367
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,211
just raised.
Alice Cooper was a little bit like me 

368
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,100
when he was a kid.
His mom used to dress up in a suit every

369
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,520
day and he was a gawky thin with a huge 
nose.

370
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,250
Um,
I was walking in with a huge nose.

371
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,170
I can identify and never wore suits.
Now.

372
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,620
And he was always a teacher's pet and 
the result was the other kids hated him 

373
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,720
and he was kicked around and beaten and,
and excluded the way that I'd been 

374
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,630
kicked around and beaten and excluded.

375
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Then one day a neighbor was at in his 
kitchen who was into a weegee board and 

376
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,000
making contact with spirits through the 
Wigi board.

377
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,680
Um,
so,

378
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,340
uh,
spirit allegedly contacted her and said,

379
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,400
I am the ghost of a witch who was burned
at the stake in the 16th century and,

380
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,810
or 17th century.
And you pointing to Alice,

381
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,840
I'm pointing to his saying was runs for 
an ea at the time,

382
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,260
pointing to Vince.
You are my moderate reincarnation.

383
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,320
And My name is Alice Cooper.
Now,

384
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,060
when,
when Vince for an ea one onstage and 

385
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,101
address with Mascara at a high school 
talent night for the very first time 

386
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:43,470
playing his own music,
chopping up baby dolls with an ax,

387
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,570
which is the more real person Vince for 
an EA,

388
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:52,571
the shy little kid dressed up in a suit 
who gave apples to his teacher or Alice 

389
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Cooper,
the person on stage who comes to life 

390
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,981
with an ecstatic identity that makes 
them a surfer on the back of those mass 

391
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:04,271
passions,
those mass exhilaration that make the 

392
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:04,271
forces of history.

393
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:08,200
Well Alice of the two,
they're both real people and they're 

394
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,300
both inside events for an ea,
but the one that's in there that has the

395
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:13,730
greatest passionate intensity is the 
Alice Cooper.

396
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,870
Not the Vince for an ai and that's why 
they'll.

397
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:20,650
He had been picked on and none of the 
kids in his school had liked him.

398
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,320
The minute he finished his first 
performance,

399
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,160
all the football guys who used to beat 
the crap out of him,

400
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,580
surge down to the foot of the stage and 
volunteer to be parts of his band and 

401
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,240
when he was super famous.
Some of those guys were still mainstays 

402
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,150
of his band.
We carry many selves round inside of us 

403
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,861
and my job in pr was to find people who 
deserved to be iconic and then to 

404
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,180
explain to them,
first of all,

405
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,750
I will not.
If you think that I as your publicist,

406
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I'm going to crash in an artificial mask
and image and through that make you a 

407
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:57,760
star.

408
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm going to get you an appointment with
my best competitor immediately.

409
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,920
You'll be with them.
And um,

410
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,990
if you're going to work with me,
you have to understand something.

411
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,110
The music you make as a human soul that 
comes from the very soul of you and what

412
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:16,131
happens to you when you go out on stage 
and feel as if yourself leaves you and 

413
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:20,631
you are danced like a puppet or like a 
puppet on a string like a marionette on 

414
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,420
stage.
The force that moves you,

415
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,421
that's one of the gods inside of you 
that is your soul and what you're 

416
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:28,480
experiencing with that audience.
It's a soul exchange.

417
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,990
If you're willing to put up with the 
fact that music is not about marketing,

418
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:35,470
music is not about product.
Music is not about downloads,

419
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:39,550
music is about the human soul that I 
will work with you

420
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,580
and quite the statement for a Zionist 
atheists chew.

421
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,050
Yes.
It really is whole and not manner that,

422
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,070
you know,
I listened to Alice Cooper a lot when I 

423
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,760
was a kid and still now especially that 
record a welcome to my nightmare,

424
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,980
which I think is an absolute classic.
You know,

425
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:57,840
there's a couple of pop songs on it 
which,

426
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,110
which I think,
I mean record companies did that a fair 

427
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,110
bit on,
on,

428
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,610
on concept albums.
You know,

429
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,690
they'd throw a pop hit on there,
but as a concept album it's brilliant 

430
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,581
and it's really well arranged and it's 
really not horrifying exactly because 

431
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:19,620
that's not exactly right,
but it's unbelievably dramatic.

432
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:24,621
I would say theatrical in,
in the best way and I really think it's 

433
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:25,710
a work of genius that welcome to my 
nightmare.

434
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:28,170
So and I,
I had no idea that,

435
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,290
that that was Alice Cooper's background,
although I did hear that he was the 

436
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:33,420
child of a minister.
Is that also correct?

437
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,070
No,
no,

438
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:36,500
no.
His father was in the aerospace industry

439
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,030
in Arizona.
Oh,

440
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,970
big aerospace territory.
Right.

441
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,210
But a lot of kids who were turned on to 
Alice Cooper and were turned on by 

442
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,200
shock.
Bands like that were the children of a 

443
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,130
ministers,
the children of deeply religious people.

444
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,690
The religious right.
Bringing out the other side of things.

445
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
He did things right.
He's obviously the precursor of people 

446
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,740
like Marilyn Manson.
Yes,

447
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,170
exactly.
I'm Marilyn Manson was to sort of cheap,

448
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,540
even though Marilyn Manson was kind 
enough to be good.

449
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:13,541
To me,
Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap a 

450
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,690
takeoff on Alice Cooper didn't have the 
staying power that Alice seems to have 

451
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,870
had.
But the point is that I.

452
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,170
One of the things that I told you,
if you are going to be my client,

453
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:26,171
as you just don't,
you don't just tell your audience or 

454
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:26,420
assault,
you owe your audience your life.

455
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Now,
Jordan had told me 20 years to 

456
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,750
articulate what I meant by that.
Um,

457
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,100
and it's simply that if you deserve to 
be a superstar,

458
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,950
then you just,
you will become an iconic figure.

459
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,220
And 12 year old kids will paste posters,
his view on their bedroom walls and you 

460
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:46,970
will be,
you know,

461
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,540
the concept of the Trellis.
You grow a tomato plant on a trellis.

462
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Well,
you will be the Trellis on which people 

463
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,690
row you will be the role model.
So your life is one of the most 

464
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,221
important things that you have to offer.
But I wasn't just after the superficial 

465
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:07,280
life I was after I was after this.
When you sit down,

466
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,320
have an afternoon,
let's say 2:00

467
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:12,800
in the afternoon with a blank computer 
screen or a blank piece of paper and you

468
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:15,950
need to write a lyric.
You feel as if you could.

469
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,590
You don't know how you've ever written a
lyric in your life.

470
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,220
You certainly know you can't write 
another one again and by 4:00

471
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:26,900
in the afternoon on a good day,
there's a lyric in front of you by 4:00

472
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,380
in the afternoon are really,
really rare day.

473
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,620
That lyric is so perfect in itself,
but it feels like it wrote itself 

474
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,680
through you.
When you go onstage,

475
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,850
if you see the doc,
the pupils of the audience dilating,

476
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,960
if you see their faces melting,
losing individual characteristics.

477
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,170
If you see their energy fusing into a 
collective energy rather than just 

478
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,990
individual energies,
and if that collective force reaches a a

479
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,060
pseudopod out to you and hooks into 
something inside of you that's bigger 

480
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,221
than yourself and again,
you'll feel like an empty pipe and 

481
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:06,341
something inside you is transmographers 
all of this energy and flooding it back 

482
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:09,290
down to the audience and reverberate 
Tory circuit and you have an out of body

483
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:14,291
experience.
You Watch yourself from the ceiling as 

484
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:14,390
your dance.
That self inside of you,

485
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:19,391
the dances you onstage.
That is your fucking Goddamn soul and 

486
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:23,480
that's my my and tend to find and that's
what I intend to introduce you to.

487
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,780
Why?
Because you are about to become an icon 

488
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,740
and if you become an icon,
you have to be a force that takes 

489
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,850
hundreds of thousands or even tens of 
millions of kids who feel lost in the 

490
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:42,191
world who don't dare express their 
feelings because there are no except 

491
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,010
socially acceptable words for their and 
who

492
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,620
feel crazy,
isolated and alone,

493
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,950
and you by revealing what's deep inside 
of you will validate what's deep inside 

494
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:57,051
of them.
So I think you had the other made the 

495
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:59,871
other shoe drop for me then because you 
know you're talking about that at least 

496
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:04,221
in part,
you're talking about that ecstatic 

497
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,471
experience as the,
as the necessary counter position to 

498
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:09,690
isolation and abandonment,
loneliness and all of those things,

499
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,980
which,
which I think is a very,

500
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,450
a very reasonable way of thinking about 
it.

501
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:19,451
It's like meaning as the antidote to 
isolation and tragedy and malevolence 

502
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:22,410
for that matter.
And music is no.

503
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,670
I've thought deeply about music.
I've,

504
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,720
I've tried to figure out why it has what
it represents and why it has the effects

505
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,380
that it has.
And I think,

506
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:33,880
and this is a neuroscientific view of it
to some degree,

507
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:37,470
and you know,
it seems to me that it's better to think

508
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:42,471
about the world as,
as something that consists of patterns 

509
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,410
rather than as something that consists 
of objects.

510
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,040
So an object would actually be a pattern
that sustains itself across time.

511
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,680
It's not all that very,
very good insight.

512
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,760
I get applause for that.
Thank you.

513
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,590
Thank you.
And so,

514
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,000
so then you think,
well,

515
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,290
for you,
you can even think about the way the 

516
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,290
visual system works this way.
So,

517
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,750
you know,
we tend to think that there's a world 

518
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,630
out there and then there's an image of 
that world projected onto our retina and

519
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:07,770
then the images is reconstructed,
say in our visual cortex.

520
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,180
And then we,
uh,

521
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,400
then we,
we can become conscious of that image 

522
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,490
and planner actions and in consequence 
of that.

523
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:19,491
But that isn't how it works.
The way it works is that there are 

524
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,451
patterns in the world and then the 
patterns are shifted into patterns of 

525
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,010
light of illumination.
And then those are shifted into patterns

526
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:27,660
of neural activity on the retina.

527
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,960
And then those are shifted into patterns
of neural conductance,

528
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,590
the optical nerves,
and then patterns in the visual Cortex,

529
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:37,260
and then those are expressed as patterns
of movement.

530
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,740
So it's all the transformations of 
patterns and the meeting of a visual 

531
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,030
perception is the pattern of action that
it gives rise to,

532
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,520
which is why you need a body meant to be
able to perceive.

533
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,850
And I think the reason that music speaks
so deeply to us of fundamental meaning 

534
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,710
is because it's actually the most 
representative art form.

535
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,100
You know?
Because people think about it in some 

536
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,100
senses,
the least representative art form.

537
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,780
I don't think that's right at all.
I think it represents the reality that 

538
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,431
exists in a profound sense beyond what 
our senses revealed to us moment to 

539
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:12,411
moment and so it puts people then when 
you're moving to the music and we were 

540
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:13,800
all moving to the music or when you're 
dancing,

541
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,801
let's say with someone else and you're 
and you're as pairs and you're all 

542
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:18,801
dancing together.

543
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:21,900
It's that the patterns of the cosmos,
so to speak,

544
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,110
manifesting themselves as the patterns 
of the music manifesting themselves as 

545
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,760
the patterns of your body and in 
syncopation with everyone else.

546
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:34,110
So it's also a symbolic representation 
of a harmonious and ideal society.

547
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,750
And there it is something that's beyond 
us.

548
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,790
And so it's,
it's interest.

549
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:39,650
So I get it.
So,

550
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,830
so partly what you're saying,
if I understand you,

551
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:46,831
is that for you there,
the ecstatic collective experience that 

552
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:50,820
was associated with music,
for example in pop music perhaps was you

553
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:54,210
could see it out very clearly as the 
antidote to painful isolation.

554
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,080
And,
and I mean,

555
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,170
one of the things that struck me as,
as,

556
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,700
as struck me as near miraculous about 
music,

557
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:02,860
especially in a rather nihilistic and 
atheistic society,

558
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:07,470
is that it really does fill the void 
that was left by the death of God.

559
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,280
And it's partly because you cannot 
rationally critique music.

560
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,270
You know,
it speaks to you.

561
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:16,180
It speaks of meaning.
And no matter what you say about it,

562
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,240
no matter how cynical you are,
you cannot put a crow bar underneath 

563
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,130
that and lifted up and,
and,

564
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,830
and toss it aside.
And music was so,

565
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,110
such a powerful cultural force in the 
sixties and the seventies and 

566
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,110
overwhelmingly.
Yeah,

567
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,120
powerful force.
So the other,

568
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,220
the other element is very important to 
this music is the voice of a subculture.

569
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,490
So when you tell 100 million kids who 
failed utterly isolated and alone that 

570
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,721
they,
that their experiences have not been 

571
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:48,721
reflected in the experience of any other
person on earth,

572
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,530
that in fact they are not alone.
Layer a movement.

573
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,960
Um,
you give a subculture,

574
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,600
a voice and you can see that with,
well,

575
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,850
when I finally got into working with 
music,

576
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:01,300
one of the first things I did was work 
with country and western music.

577
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,340
Now Jordan,
uh,

578
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,380
I worked with a company called dot 
records.

579
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,390
I was hired by a Gulf of western to 
found a public artist relations 

580
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,500
departments where there 14 record 
companies.

581
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,660
And one of those companies was not 
records and dot records was number three

582
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:20,661
on the country charts and that it was 
with third place company and he wanted 

583
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,540
to be number one,
uh,

584
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,520
in country and western music now when I 
was a child when I was about three and a

585
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:31,521
half years old,
I woke up on a Sunday before anybody 

586
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:31,920
else in the house,
so had woken up,

587
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,350
went out to the front room where there 
was sunlight,

588
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:39,351
which I didn't get to see as often as 
I'd like and turned on the radio and 

589
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,970
because it was 6:00
in the morning or something like that,

590
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,750
what I got were from reports and country
and Western music.

591
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,450
This was in 19,
19,

592
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:50,570
46 or something like that,
or 1947.

593
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:56,110
And I immediately knew that that music 
was alien to me and I knew that it was 

594
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:02,521
the music of another subculture would 
not necessarily be kind to the 

595
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,320
subculture from which I came.
So I never liked country music.

596
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,340
But in the 19 seventies when I got this 
position with Gulf and western,

597
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,670
one of the things I crusaded for the 
hardest was country and western music 

598
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,840
because I felt that these people had a 
right to express their identity.

599
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,650
I felt they had a right to get beyond 
the ghetto of the Bible belt,

600
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,470
which is where they were kept.
And where are they were suppressed.

601
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
It was an era of subculture is finding 
themselves and expressing their right to

602
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:32,710
exist.
It started with

603
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,880
music really does seem to have that 
binding capacity,

604
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:40,881
you know,
and I think there's also something 

605
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,370
neurological that,
because tell me what you think about 

606
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,381
this,
if this is in accordance with your 

607
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:48,911
observations,
but it seems to me that the music that 

608
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:50,990
people listen to as their catalyzing 
their adult identity,

609
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,580
say between the ages of about 14,
15 to 20,

610
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,470
you know,
there's a,

611
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,280
there's a,
there's a real intense,

612
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,240
um,

613
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,880
period of neural pruning that occurs at 
the end of adolescence.

614
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:06,540
So you get an endless amount of neural 
neural pruning after,

615
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,060
uh,
after you're born in the early stages of

616
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:14,061
infancy because you have a lot of neural
connections and then a lot of them you 

617
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:17,721
kind of tie into your childhood,
sell twice as many neurons as you will 

618
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,250
actually need,
right?

619
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,140
Right.
Exactly.

620
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:20,280
And so,
so you're,

621
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:25,281
you're a massive possibility and then 
you dye into your actuality and then 

622
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:25,820
that happens again.
It laid out lessons,

623
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,830
right?
Which is also in schizophrenia develops 

624
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:30,830
because that process seems to go wrong 
for some people,

625
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,570
but as you're dying into that adult 
identity,

626
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,900
one of the things that seems to catalyze
that is the music of your culture at 

627
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,920
that time.
And that also seems to unite you in some

628
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,630
way underneath rational thought with the
people of your generation,

629
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:48,420
let's say with the people you'd have to 
cooperate with and compete with.

630
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,760
And so there's something really deep 
about that too.

631
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,340
That's not well understood.
And,

632
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,360
and,
and so I.

633
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,360
well,
so I don't know what you think about

634
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,400
the second element of that because it's 
a brilliant observation.

635
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,730
And the second element of that is that 
in your late teens,

636
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,220
your prefrontal cortex gets wired up.
Now,

637
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:08,540
what's the prefrontal cortex?
It's pro.

638
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,570
We talk about it as the center of 
Administration in the brain executive 

639
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,460
functions.
It's primary job is making you human.

640
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,510
What does that mean?
You would think that means encouraging 

641
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,510
certain things like creativity and 
thought,

642
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,220
no,
the job of the prefrontal cortex and 

643
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,990
making you human is two,
what?

644
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,850
Press things?
Um,

645
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,840
it's too damp.
Things down.

646
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:35,841
It's to inhibit things and you are 
learning which things to inhibit after 

647
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,860
you become utterly grafted into your 
subculture.

648
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,170
And what is one of the elements that has
grafted you when to your subculture 

649
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,860
music.
And so what Freud would call the Super 

650
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,090
Ego is formed to a certain extent based 
on your subculture or connections that 

651
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,170
you've developed as a team.
And again,

652
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,890
music helps identify that subculture of 
which you feel apart.

653
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,610
Alright,
well,

654
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,060
okay,
so,

655
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:04,061
so partly what's happening there is that
because music is poetic and also it's 

656
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:08,320
poetic and emotional,
let's say it also constitutes the,

657
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,380
the pre irrational substrate from which 
the values of that subculture emerge.

658
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,590
So it's like the,
it's part of the mythological 

659
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:18,590
substructure of the values of that 
culture.

660
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,620
And you can make absolute sense.
Yeah,

661
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,540
yeah.
You can see that expressed in the lyrics

662
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,290
in particular where,
which lay out a system of values in some

663
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,510
sense,
something like hip hop

664
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,170
for example.
Well roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in

665
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,320
pop culture or about mating mating 
rituals.

666
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,910
There were about courtship rituals.
And you as a person who is white,

667
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:43,560
the meeting has been upgraded by the 
best and now includes.

668
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,570
Okay.
God knows what it was trying to tell us.

669
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,340
So at any rate

670
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,460
you have just emerged from childhood,
um,

671
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,490
your hormones,
your sexual hormones so began to act.

672
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,670
Girls as young as 11 can become pregnant
already.

673
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,720
And you were obsessed with finding your 
place in the world and finding a mate 

674
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,960
and courtship rituals mean okay,
an awful lot to you.

675
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,050
They're about to what they're there,
what you were about to embark on for the

676
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:15,080
next 10 years of your life at least.
Um,

677
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,360
and so this obsession with courtship 
rituals with mating and dating and 

678
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,230
breaking up and,
and be trail.

679
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,680
And all of that kind of stuff makes.
Makes absolute sense.

680
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,960
Right?
Exactly.

681
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,880
Well,
the thing is music frame style too,

682
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:33,881
because it gives you something that's in
common with your potential mate and it 

683
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:37,160
also gives you a set of rather,
I wouldn't say stereotyped activities,

684
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:42,161
but at least predictable activities that
are associated with courtship and made 

685
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:45,521
again,
so that would be going to concerts and 

686
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:47,090
going to movies which are heavily 
musically influenced and dancing and and

687
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:51,530
even discussing your,
your shared immersement in whatever that

688
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:53,350
subculture happens to be.
Right.

689
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,610
My guess is that at some point music 
provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is 

690
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:04,841
the ultimate bonding hormone and music 
is a bath in the sense of human 

691
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:10,361
belonging in the field,
but even if you're alone and you're 

692
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,930
listening to Pandora or spotify,
all by yourself,

693
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,280
it beans you social bread and meat,
and in the in the nervous system,

694
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:23,361
the central nervous system,
everything boils down to inhibition or 

695
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:27,461
excitation.
There is a hormone of excitation and 

696
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:31,031
it's glutamate.
There is a hormone of inhibition and 

697
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,520
that's the Gabba and oxytocin feeds down
into the Gaba system.

698
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,730
Okay.

699
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,230
The system that keeps you calm down,
basically it gives you a sense of peace.

700
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,800
Um,
now music itself,

701
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,660
uh,
I mean the first musical.

702
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,780
First I have to give you an experience 
that I had that allowed me to see into 

703
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,930
all of this.
I had already been fascinated by the 

704
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,710
gods inside of us.
I concluded the age of 12,

705
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:57,711
that I was an atheist and if there were 
no bounds and they have an above us and 

706
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:57,990
know God's in the ground beneath us,
where were the gods,

707
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,400
will.
My parents were trying to drive,

708
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,500
dragged me an atheist off the high 
holiday services and they were so intent

709
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:09,501
about it,
but I was literally holding onto the 

710
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:11,861
doorframe of their blue fraser or by now
forgotten car and they were shredding my

711
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:18,481
socks.
They were practically tearing my shoes 

712
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:18,481
off.
They were doing everything they could to

713
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:19,270
get me up to the temple.

714
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,630
And so I realized in that moment,
if the gods are not above,

715
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:24,180
if the gods are not below,
where are they?

716
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,500
They're inside my parents.
If they're inside my parents,

717
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:28,300
they're inside of me there inside of all
of us.

718
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,660
So my task at a basically the age of 12 
to 13 became use your scientific to find

719
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,310
the gods inside of us.
Okay.

720
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,550
Well you also,
again,

721
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:44,551
you elaborated on that part of the story
that also made you a tune to those 

722
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:45,940
ecstatic experiences because the case 
that you've just laid out,

723
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,970
or I suppose we laid out together to 
some degree is that perhaps it was that 

724
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,160
the fact that you were isolated as a kid
made you even more sensitive to the 

725
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,151
collective belonging element of music 
because you were so starved for it and 

726
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,080
then they.
The idea of the gods within that you 

727
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,080
just laid out.

728
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,660
It seems to me to be very much akin to 
what you described as either your tactic

729
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:14,251
or your philosophy with regards to pr 
for the rock personalities because what 

730
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:18,211
you said you were doing was trying to 
make them reveal some of these 

731
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,410
archetypal figures within and that that 
would.

732
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,480
And that you were actually trying to 
foster that.

733
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:25,210
Which meant in some sense you weren't 
doing pr at all.

734
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,270
Like,
I don't know what the hell you'd call 

735
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:30,270
it.
I call it secular shamanism was a name I

736
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,500
was never comfortable with because it's 
so unscientific,

737
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:37,950
but that was the closest I can come to 
what it's like dowsing for the human 

738
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:37,950
soul.
What would it be?

739
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,260
Any good name for a PR company?
A second.

740
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

741
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,120
But I think that's a very.
Well,

742
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:48,121
I think that's a very useful way of 
thinking about it because obviously one 

743
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:51,970
of the hold overs from the shamanic 
traditions is obviously music.

744
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,960
I mean,
that's just,

745
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,910
that's just a continuation of the same 
tradition thing.

746
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,400
There was one very important thing that 
had happened to me when I was 16 years 

747
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,400
old,
even though I was listening,

748
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,560
popular kid in my school,
they voted me for two years in a row,

749
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:07,360
the chairman of the programming 
committee,

750
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:12,361
which means I ran student assemblies 
five days a week and I program to a 

751
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:12,820
week.
Um,

752
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,850
so I was the emcee for these things.
And one day that you manage that and 

753
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,300
similar be unpopular.
Uh,

754
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,630
that's a good question.
I think my school had very,

755
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,740
very minimally.
I stole.

756
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,750
This school was founded by an Acolyte of
John Dewey and he was behind the scenes 

757
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:31,440
are actually setting the school up and 
it,

758
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,180
you know,
schools have their popularity positions,

759
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,590
president,
vice president,

760
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,760
secretary,
treasurer,

761
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,700
all of that,
but my school was clever enough to start

762
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,430
putting functional committees together.

763
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,580
In your very first days at school,
your very first days of your a freshman 

764
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,411
year now when you,
when you have kids vote for president 

765
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:57,511
and vice president road for the most 
popular kid in the school as the 

766
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:00,661
precedent.
The second most popular kid as vice 

767
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,061
president,
the most popular girl as secretary and 

768
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,360
the most popular Jewish treasurer.
That's just the way it goes.

769
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Well,
I was never aligned for any of those 

770
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,320
positions.
I had no popularity whatsoever.

771
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,970
In fact,
one of my classmates actually fired with

772
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:17,500
remarkable accuracy from only 23 d way a
soccer ball directly into my face.

773
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,590
And believe me,
it has a lot of force distance of 20 

774
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:22,970
feet.
So.

775
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,900
But when it comes to functional 
positions,

776
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,390
like how do we run these school 
assemblies?

777
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,890
The popular kids don't have a clue.
So if you bring them into a room,

778
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,610
if there arbitrarily,
for example,

779
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:39,611
assigned to a committee,
they will all piss on their a little 

780
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:41,810
piece of territory,
they'll all stake out a position of some

781
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:46,700
kind just to establish their status in 
the room and after 15 minutes.

782
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,700
So this one,
they've all said their piece and it 

783
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:51,890
comes time to actually do something.
They're clueless,

784
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,900
they're silent,
they don't know what to do.

785
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,140
And if there is an unpopular geek like 
me who at that 20 minute mark all of a 

786
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,911
sudden has an idea,
they will glom around you even if they 

787
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:04,260
don't like you.
Right?

788
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,590
So competence can,
can,

789
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,620
can,
can step in where we're popularity 

790
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:11,620
cannot go.
Yes,

791
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,740
that's a very well put phrase.
So,

792
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:17,741
so there I was the head of this 
programming committee and one of the 

793
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,250
kids,
one of the juniors came to me and said,

794
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:21,260
we're doing a dance.
We're,

795
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,740
you know,
we're setting up a dance and could you 

796
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,051
advertise it for us?
And he didn't realize just how absurd 

797
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:32,231
that statement was.
If there's a dance or a party of any 

798
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:32,231
kind in buffalo,
New York.

799
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:37,061
One of the first things you have to 
realize about it is I am not just 

800
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,220
disinvited.

801
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I haven't decided to stay as far away as
humanly possible and yet they want me to

802
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,770
advertise this dance.
So Jordan,

803
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,020
I can't dance.
I am.

804
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,820
I can't do a box step.
I can't do a Fox trot,

805
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:52,100
I can't do a waltz,
I can't do any of those things,

806
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,490
but I went onstage and put some music on
the turntable and danced and I saw the 

807
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:02,720
pupils dilating of the audience.
Three hundred 50 people who hated me and

808
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:04,880
hated me for two and a half years of 
that point,

809
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,700
their pupils were dilating,
their faces were melting.

810
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,970
I felt that pseudopod of energy coming 
to me and through me as if I were a 

811
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:18,191
pipe.
I felt it going up to something inside 

812
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:19,460
of me more or less.
It had level that utterly transmogrified

813
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:21,890
it and I felt the energy being sent 
back.

814
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,970
Every mood that I was making an I had an
out of body experience.

815
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,940
I saw,
I thought I was on the ceiling.

816
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,180
I've watched all of this from the 
ceiling and apparently it looked like a 

817
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,161
loony toon drawn on Lsd as if Chuck 
Jones had been doing Tom and Jerry after

818
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:44,090
taking a very big hit of acid.
It was one of the strangest,

819
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,120
weirdest things you've ever seen and 
when it was all over.

820
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,360
So that was my ecstatic experience.
When it was all over,

821
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,540
the audience did something that had 
never done in my days at that school,

822
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,700
I would never do again.
So long as I was there,

823
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,910
it surged to the foot of the stage and 
as if it had practiced this act all its 

824
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,180
life,
it picked me up off the stage.

825
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,360
It put me on his shoulders,
it carried me out of the auditorium and 

826
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,790
it carried me up the pathway to the 
building above where we had our classes.

827
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,920
So that was my introduction.
Yeah.

828
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,980
And,
but this is,

829
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,850
that's crazy story.
Right?

830
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:21,851
And this is three years after I'd gone 
off after the ecstatic experience,

831
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,660
knowing that it was something vital.
I mean,

832
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,970
I'd heard at the age of 14,
two years earlier,

833
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,210
I had heard that there was a book called
the varieties of the religious 

834
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:31,210
experience,
and in those days we,

835
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,290
no Amazon,
um,

836
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,840
we had local bookstores and local 
bookstores in Buffalo.

837
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:37,830
I mean,
give me a break,

838
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
but I finally found a copy of the 
University of Buffalo Bookstore and it 

839
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,361
felt as if William James had been laying
out a series of examples of the ecstatic

840
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,660
experience,
um,

841
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,800
with all of its delusions and 
hallucinations and all the rest on a 

842
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,390
laboratory bench.
And then saying to me,

843
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,710
look,
you're coming along.

844
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:03,450
Seventy years later you're going to have
scientific tools that I did not have.

845
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,510
This is your job.
And it was my job,

846
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:11,511
not just because William James was 
giving it to me because something deep 

847
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:12,210
inside of me was crying out to 
understand it.

848
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,450
And it probably was that the privilege 
of social disconnection,

849
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,940
the privilege of social deprivation.
Because that privilege made me 

850
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,141
sensitive.
And it's always made me sensitive to 

851
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:27,141
group behavior.
Right?

852
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,060
So when I was in Moscow in 2005 
lecturing,

853
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,760
a group of quantum physicists from all 
over the world,

854
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,670
I'm why everything they know about 
quantum physics does wrong.

855
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,700
It's because there is no such thing as 
an isolated particle.

856
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,160
Every particle is part of our herd,
a mob,

857
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,550
a group of some kind.
Um,

858
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,090
the quantum physicists based on the idea
that when you,

859
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,320
when you treat a Photon,
a single photon in a certain way,

860
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,230
when you split it into here's how it's 
going to behave.

861
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,250
But if it's being measured,
that's not going to happen.

862
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,090
Well,
guess what?

863
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,160
We're constantly taking each other's 
measure.

864
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Photons are constantly taking each 
other's measure because they move in 

865
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,400
groups,
crowds and herds.

866
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,290
That's why a beam of sunshine comes 
through your window,

867
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,840
not a photon.
A sunshine.

868
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,530
And when I finished the speech,
I was sure they were going to throw me 

869
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,410
out of the conference because these are 
all people committed deeply to quantum 

870
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,971
physics.
And instead they sat there beaming like 

871
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:27,540
a proud uncles and I could not figure 
out why.

872
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,990
And three years later,
my collaborator in quantum physics,

873
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,640
uh,
at the university,

874
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:37,641
at the mathematics,
so the Russian Academy of Sciences in 

875
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:38,520
Moscow Sanity Mail,
and he said,

876
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,720
Dr,
use your club who ran that conference 

877
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,310
and gave you such a hard time about your
credit card,

878
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,670
has just published a book.
It's a new approach to quantum physics.

879
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,420
It's called constructive physics.
You have to get it immediately.

880
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,660
So I downloaded it from org.
I listened to it that afternoon on my 

881
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,520
hour and a half walk through the park on
my way to the cafe where I do all my 

882
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,220
work and I got all excited.

883
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,310
Every social concept that means every 
concept that I had given in this talk 

884
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,630
was in this book.
So Jordan,

885
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:17,631
I've had the privilege of proceedings 
through life with this enormous 

886
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:18,600
advantage,
social deprivation.

887
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,240
Then I'm still going to chase you back 
to the story about the PR company,

888
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,600
but I have another question for you.
So you know,

889
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:32,601
you,
you are detailing out the kind of 

890
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:34,870
childhood that in principle could have 
left you bitter and resentful.

891
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,110
So why didn't it like,
why didn't that happen to you?

892
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,060
Why?
Because of my father,

893
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:43,120
um,
my mother was a deep pessimists.

894
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,240
My father was a profound optimist and I 
must've had my father's genes 

895
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:53,761
predominating over.
I've got them both optimism and 

896
00:47:53,761 --> 00:47:57,481
pessimism,
but I'm grateful for everything that's 

897
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,000
happened in my life.
I'm working every deprivation,

898
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:03,210
you know,
I was sick in bed for 15 years and even 

899
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:03,210
that turned out to be,
it was nightmarish.

900
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:08,010
It was horrible at it.
Inflicted pains for which there are no 

901
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,851
words in the English language because I 
was isolated for five years and could 

902
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:13,750
not talk,
literally could not muster the energy to

903
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:16,630
move the larynx to give a single 
syllable of sound.

904
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,860
And yet I,
it was nightmarish.

905
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:22,330
Horrible.
A monsters does.

906
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,530
It was.
I kind of,

907
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:26,110
I found it to international scientific 
groups at that time.

908
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,160
I wrote three books and I learned what 
it's like to be at that extreme of the 

909
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,060
human experience.
Extreme isolation,

910
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,340
um,
extreme pain.

911
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,690
What happened?
Like,

912
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,520
what,
what were you suffering from?

913
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,230
Well,
we figured it out.

914
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:46,231
I mean,
I figured it out on my own and then 

915
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:46,231
taught my doctor about it.
It's called chronic fatigue syndrome.

916
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:50,911
It's better sometimes known as Myalgic 
encephalomyelitis and nobody knows what 

917
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:52,480
causes it,
but in 1988,

918
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,780
I really had been working on my book for
a long enough to have fifth,

919
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,090
the first 15 chapters of my first book.

920
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,420
I really wanted to get out of publicity.
There's no way I could have because I 

921
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,201
was a legend.
I mean the billboard guide to music 

922
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:10,750
publicity had 20 pages of nothing but 
me.

923
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,000
Um,
so,

924
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,940
you know,
your wife is not going to let you out of

925
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,470
a successful career and she's,
she doesn't want to lose the money.

926
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,530
She doesn't want to lose the status.
Um,

927
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,290
and all of a sudden wank.
I didn't know what was happening to me.

928
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:29,110
It was 90 degrees out and I'd be 
freezing and shivering.

929
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,500
It was 40 degrees out and I will be 
overheated.

930
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,540
Um,
I was,

931
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:39,541
I was losing strengths,
I was losing the strength to pick up 

932
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,830
coat and I had no idea of what was 
happening.

933
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:45,070
And I went to doctors and the doctors 
had no idea of what was happening.

934
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:46,750
And I walked into my office one day.

935
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:51,560
It was the biggest pr firm in the music 
industry and said to myself,

936
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,890
I don't know what's happening.
I could be dying,

937
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,220
but I'm going to be out of here in two 
weeks and I'm giving you the business,

938
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,990
and the next day a competitor from the 
west coast called and offered me a huge 

939
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,380
amount of money for the business and I 
said,

940
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:10,381
I cannot sell it to you.
I just gave it to my staff yesterday 

941
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:13,260
because my word is my bond and I kept 
trying to struggling to try to do normal

942
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:16,240
things.
Leon Uris,

943
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,970
when I finished my manuscript of the 
first book,

944
00:50:18,971 --> 00:50:23,971
the Lucifer principle,
a scientific expedition into the forces 

945
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:24,460
of history.
I got a copy to Leon Uris,

946
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:29,490
the novelist and Leon Uris,
reddit and called on a Sunday night and 

947
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:34,031
raved about it for half an hour.
So I tried to get into New York to see 

948
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:34,820
him,
but I had to rent.

949
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,600
Are you ready for this?
Because I couldn't afford this.

950
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,840
I had a rental Lillo so I could lay down
in the back seat all the way into 

951
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:47,981
Manhattan to see Leon and then lay down 
in the back seat all the way home and 

952
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,040
it's the world's most glamorous 
limousine story.

953
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,100
Now.
It's not at all the world's most 

954
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,441
glamorous limousines journey.
Eventually I learned I couldn't even do 

955
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:02,051
that and eventually it became too weak 
to even try because I was just lucky to 

956
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:06,401
be able to get to my bathroom.
But if I tried to get to my kitchen and 

957
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:09,580
extra 10 steps away,
no my body wouldn't let me do it.

958
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:14,110
And one of the lessons I learned in my 
childhood again when I was 16 years old,

959
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:19,040
poetry was extremely important to me and
I learned a lesson from two poets.

960
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,600
One was at the St Vincent Millay and her
poem Renascence said too,

961
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,090
see the infinite in the tiniest of 
things,

962
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:31,091
which was definitely a goal on my list.
You have to be able to comprehend the 

963
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:35,721
suffering of every human on the face of 
this planet under every extreme 

964
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,141
circumstance.
And I expanded that to mean you have to 

965
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:40,960
come to understand not just the 
suffering,

966
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:45,961
but the point of view of every one who 
comes from a culture that's so foreign 

967
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:49,060
to years that it seems like comes from 
another planet.

968
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:54,420
So this was what Edna Saint Vincent 
Millay was telling me was 15 years 

969
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:00,140
absolute and unbelievable punishment is 
an advantage

970
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,890
and it will serve you well for the rest 
of your life.

971
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,950
You've got a story to tell you then.
This is something I learned from Carl 

972
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:08,110
Young.
So in the,

973
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:09,120
uh,
in,

974
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,640
in the sharp cathedral in,
in France,

975
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:18,570
there's a maze and that you walk and 
it's at the center point of the 

976
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,750
Cathedral.
That's a crucifix essentially.

977
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:27,751
And so the maze is at the center of the 
acts that marks the point of maximum 

978
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:29,590
suffering.
Right now.

979
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,320
It's a symbolic pilgrimage.
And what you do is you,

980
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,400
it amazes a circle.
And in the middle is a symbol that looks

981
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,760
kinda like a rose.
And in order to get to the middle,

982
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:45,761
which is that central point,
you have to enter the maze and then you 

983
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:47,870
have to walk through the,
the each quadrant.

984
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,150
So you have to circumambulating the 
world.

985
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:51,580
You have to go northwest,
east,

986
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,340
east,
and south.

987
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:54,410
You have to cover every bit of 
territory.

988
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,070
And then you get to the middle.
And the middle is marked by the x,

989
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:00,940
which is the point,
the point of consciousness,

990
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:02,890
you might say the center point of the 
world,

991
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,950
but also the place where you voluntarily
accept your suffering

992
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,260
sandwiches,
what Christ did.

993
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,270
I mean if I'm not a Christian,
but if you believe in the,

994
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,100
um,
the religion that St Paul created based 

995
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,620
on Jesus,
um,

996
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,080
than okay.

997
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:27,240
God had to become human in to experience
human suffering.

998
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:33,350
And when Christ was on the cross,
writhing in agony and screamed,

999
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:35,040
Eli,
Eli Sabachthani,

1000
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,000
my Lord,
my Lord,

1001
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:41,001
why Hast Thou forsaken me?
It's because God needed to experience 

1002
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,560
the absolute extreme of human despair.
Um,

1003
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,040
in order to carry out his task of saving
mankind.

1004
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,260
Um,
and one way or the other religion talks 

1005
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,820
to us really about what we need to do.
There's this,

1006
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,690
I've got this saying in here,
let me see if I can find it.

1007
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,940
Um,
it's not in front of me at the moment,

1008
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,400
but it gives me a second as it's very 
important.

1009
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,200
It's an epigram that I wrote a few years
ago and it says,

1010
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:11,070
since there is no god,
it is our job to do his work.

1011
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,850
God is not a beating.
He isn't aspiration,

1012
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,110
a gift,
a vision,

1013
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:21,150
a goal to see.
Ours is the responsibility of making a 

1014
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,480
cool universe turned just of turning 
pains to understandings and new insights

1015
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:26,670
into joy,
of creating ways to soar,

1016
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,650
the skies for generations,
yet to come,

1017
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,910
a fascinating wings with which our 
children's children shall overcome,

1018
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:38,210
of making worlds of fantasy materialize 
as reality of mining and transforming 

1019
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,260
our greatest gifts,
our passions,

1020
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,540
our imaginings,
our pains,

1021
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,880
our insecurities and our lusts.

1022
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,470
This is the work of deity and D,
it is a power that resides in us.

1023
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,160
In other words,
if these are things that we imagine that

1024
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:58,161
Jesus has done on our behalf and on 
behalf of a more ethereal God in the 

1025
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,550
sky,
these have to be our aspirations,

1026
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:05,670
indeed one of my books,
the genius of the beast,

1027
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:08,640
a radical revision of capitalism and 
talks about material miracles,

1028
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,140
the very laptops with which we are 
having this conversation,

1029
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,110
the various zoom with software that we 
are using.

1030
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:21,230
These are fucking material miracles,
m and s and we are here to save each 

1031
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:26,991
other.
When when Joan jets manager came to me 

1032
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,560
and said,
Joan has been turned down by 23 record 

1033
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,871
companies that if you get her just one 
line and one of the trade magazines or 

1034
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,370
record company will snap her up and make
her a star and I can go back.

1035
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:39,780
He said to being a song writer and a 
producer and I sat him down on the couch

1036
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,410
and said,
Kenny,

1037
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,260
that's not the way things happen.
The day they are.

1038
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:48,360
Record come.
No record company is going to sign you 

1039
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,181
on the basis of one sentence.
The day a record company signs you was 

1040
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:54,741
the day your troubles beginning and um,
and you have to fashion a panzer take 

1041
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,810
tank strategy that can ride over every 
obstacle you can possibly imagine.

1042
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,660
So if you work the way I worked 17 hours
a day,

1043
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,330
seven days a week,
if you do everything I tell you too,

1044
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:09,180
I guarantee you we will have a star in 
two years.

1045
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:14,510
One thing that I knew is that I love 
rock and roll was going to be a hit.

1046
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,030
Now what does that have to do with 
secular salvation?

1047
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,180
Everything.
Because according to work that was done 

1048
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,390
with deeper studies and the 19 eighties,
the 19 nineties,

1049
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,450
we all cycled through about seven major 
mood swings.

1050
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,030
A date we adults,
it's more like 22 for kids,

1051
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:36,270
for adolescents,
which means we go from heaven to hell 

1052
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:39,541
and back again seven times a day.
If I can succeed in making Joel a star 

1053
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:47,421
so that her soul,
I love rock and roll appears on the 

1054
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:48,900
radio and you will love that song for 
three and a half minutes.

1055
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:52,770
That song is going to Yank you out of 
the misery of a personal hell.

1056
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,980
That is secular salvation.
If on the other hand,

1057
00:56:55,981 --> 00:57:00,981
I'm working with a filmmaker and I've 
worked with a bunch of films who can 

1058
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:03,660
yank you out of yourself or an hour and 
10 minutes or an hour and 50 minutes,

1059
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,950
that's an over an hour of sexual or 
salvation.

1060
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:07,020
Yeah.

1061
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,070
Isn't there always angels playing music 
and Heaven,

1062
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,300
isn't that?
Yes,

1063
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:16,400
unfortunately it gets very boring up 
there because all they do is sing the 

1064
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,820
praises of God he was doing to,
you know,

1065
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,170
exactly making hits we're having.

1066
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,890
Yep.
So at any rate,

1067
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:23,560
anything that,
uh,

1068
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:26,280
God can do anything we imagined that a 
god can do,

1069
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,340
that's our aspiration.
And that's what we have to do our best 

1070
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,850
to achieve.
Now we don't achieve these things in a 

1071
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,540
single lifetime.
Sometimes we engage in multigenerational

1072
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,560
projects,
the last one,

1073
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:40,240
hundred,
200 or 300 lifetimes,

1074
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,730
300 generations.
But flying,

1075
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,740
we can see the myth of has flying in it.
Um,

1076
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,500
dataless makes a pair of wax wings for 
his son,

1077
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:54,501
ICARUS and ICARUS indeed flies.
He just was a little too close to the 

1078
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:55,470
solder,
melts the wax and falls into the sea.

1079
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,550
So that dream has been around for at 
least 2,800

1080
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,551
years.
How many generations does it take to 

1081
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:04,950
make that real?
I can't even do the arithmetic,

1082
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,280
but it took until 100 years ago,
until 110 years ago to make that dream 

1083
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:13,070
come true.
If we persist,

1084
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:17,210
and I don't just mean individually,
I mean collectively,

1085
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,610
if we persist generation after 
generation,

1086
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:23,300
the things we regard as godly,
we can achieve.

1087
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,230
We must,

1088
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:30,080
we must go back now.
I'm going to go back.

1089
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:35,081
I agree with you.
I mean I also think that that what and 

1090
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:35,840
what do I mean by that?
Well,

1091
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,690
well,
I think part of it is this,

1092
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,060
that I don't,
I can't see that we have anything better

1093
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,140
to do.
No,

1094
00:58:45,141 --> 00:58:46,940
in fact,
that's a very good phrase.

1095
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:52,150
This is something I've been talking to 
two people about a lot in the last year 

1096
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,170
and it seems to be resonating 
particularly with young men.

1097
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:59,590
Is that because,
and this is maybe partly also tied into 

1098
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:02,300
your idea of the benefits of 
deprivation,

1099
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:07,301
it's like in some ways each person is 
permanently lost because we're fragile 

1100
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:11,510
and finite and mortal and all of those 
things and so the game is up pretty much

1101
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:16,511
from the beginning,
but one of the things that's so 

1102
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:16,520
interesting about that is the fact that 
you're going to lose everything.

1103
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:18,470
Also beans that you could risk 
everything.

1104
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,110
That's a very interesting point,
Jordan,

1105
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,900
if the one thing that comes out in your 
book,

1106
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,960
because I read it a month or two ago,
I know it's not coming out until 

1107
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,471
something like February is there is a 
definite Christian perspective and it is

1108
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,200
a stern and austere perspective in in 
the book and what you just expressed 

1109
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:44,921
comes from a deep Christian perspective.
We're going to lose it all so we might 

1110
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:46,850
as well risk at all and I would agree 
with that.

1111
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,210
Even though I come from a very different
kind of perspective.

1112
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,570
How did you arrive at that?
Although we're saving that for a later 

1113
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:55,760
podcast when I will interview you about 
your book.

1114
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:02,090
Well,
for me it was a matter of trying to 

1115
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,841
understand.
I would say mostly trying to understand 

1116
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:05,930
what happened in the Holocaust.
Go me too.

1117
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,350
But that's strange because you're about 
10 years younger than I am.

1118
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:14,570
Maybe even more younger than I am.
And well I'm 74.

1119
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,250
Okay.
I'm 55 so.

1120
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,860
Okay.
So there's a big difference.

1121
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,940
But I did 350 pushups,
so this morning and I was very 

1122
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,320
disappointed because last week I did 
600.

1123
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:29,321
So you've got me on the push up front,
I must say.

1124
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,740
Yeah.
So,

1125
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:31,850
but,
but the,

1126
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,600
you're absolutely right.
And that phrase of yours,

1127
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,970
uh,
there we have nothing better to do.

1128
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,400
That's a phrase that indicates an open 
ended,

1129
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,590
infinity and open ended.
And as yet on structured infinity.

1130
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,320
Now it's not completely unstructured.
Remember you.

1131
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,440
Your first major work was on the 
underlying structures of religion and 

1132
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:58,811
I'm still fascinated to read it.
I need to get it in word or PDF format 

1133
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:01,040
so I can listen to it on my kindle one 
of these days.

1134
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,670
I can send it to you.
That would be wonderful.

1135
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,480
We could actually,
if you go to my website,

1136
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,240
[inaudible] dot com.
You can download the PDF.

1137
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,140
Okay,
great.

1138
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,790
Because I've been hungry to read this 
for a long time,

1139
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,720
so the future isn't entirely unformed.
For example,

1140
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:21,470
somehow I believe,
and now this is a hypothesis,

1141
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,310
a hypothesis.
We humans seem to know what to do when 

1142
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,150
we come together in groups of a million 
$5,

1143
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:28,990
million,
$10,

1144
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:33,991
million,
$20 million because there are many 

1145
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:33,991
cities in China,
uh,

1146
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:36,020
with a population of 20 million.
There's Mexico City as well,

1147
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,320
and we fall into it naturally.
We're naturally build the 

1148
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,411
infrastructures that we need.
We naturally develop the infrastructure 

1149
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:48,641
of habit that we need to get along with 
each other at that very compressed 

1150
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:48,860
level.
And you would think,

1151
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:53,861
well,
but how did that come to be from an 

1152
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:53,861
evolutionary point of view?
After all,

1153
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:56,120
humans have never had the privilege of 
living groups of millions.

1154
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:01,320
Right?
We're going to all this behavior come 

1155
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:01,320
from,
well,

1156
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,020
remember our great form others,
the ones who are at the very,

1157
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:05,840
very base of our family tree from whom 
we derive.

1158
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Approximately 40 percent of our genes 
are bacteria and bacteria,

1159
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:14,300
do not live a life alone.
They cannot tolerate it.

1160
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:19,630
They live in groups.
So James Shapiro is one of the great 

1161
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:24,030
scholars on bacterial behavior.
When I called him one day and said,

1162
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:29,031
James,
if you drop a single bacterium into a 

1163
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:29,700
petri dish isn't going to die because of
isolation.

1164
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,140
And he said,
no,

1165
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,260
no way it's going to.
It's going to start dividing until it 

1166
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,980
makes a community.
It surrounds itself with a community.

1167
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,190
So the idea that you cannot have a 
bacteria without a community is quite 

1168
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,260
true.
It's just the bacteria,

1169
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,050
if they have enough food,
will make their own

1170
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:52,660
similar intuition about cod fish write 
fish have disappeared off the 

1171
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:58,301
northeastern coast.
Like I've read stories because I did a 

1172
01:02:58,301 --> 01:03:02,501
lot of work on oceanic appalling oceanic
destruction about four years ago for a,

1173
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,100
for a UN committee.
And uh,

1174
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:11,890
anyway,
so I was studying about the cod and 

1175
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,290
they've all disappeared and the schools 
of those things that existed back with 

1176
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,621
the Europeans first came over.
The Portuguese probably knew about them 

1177
01:03:18,621 --> 01:03:20,090
before Christopher Columbus even hit the
hit,

1178
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:24,260
the hit the America kept it secret,
but you know,

1179
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:29,090
the schools were dozens or even hundreds
of miles long and many,

1180
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:34,091
many houses the thick and the average 
fish was like three to five feet across 

1181
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:36,130
and bright,
just densely packed day.

1182
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,640
But it turns out that like the idea that
there's a cod fish is an illusion in 

1183
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:44,300
some sense.
There are schools of cod fish.

1184
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:50,040
The schools themselves know where to go 
for food and they know how to maneuver 

1185
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,341
through the ocean because the schools 
are actually millions of years old and 

1186
01:03:54,341 --> 01:03:56,200
tributed knowledge and quads.

1187
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,360
The cod organize their mating behavior 
as a consequence of the existence of the

1188
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:04,710
schools.
And they also organize themselves.

1189
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:09,390
So the larger fish are protected in the 
schools by hordes of the younger fish.

1190
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,000
And the older fish are the ones that are
more fertile.

1191
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,810
The thing about the cod is that when you
get rid of the schools,

1192
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:19,680
you get rid of the card,
you can reintroduce them because the cod

1193
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:21,480
aren't there like ants.
They're not.

1194
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,220
They're communal.
Right?

1195
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:28,340
And so once you demolish this old 
structure that has this know embodied 

1196
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:31,780
memory,
let's say that's who knows how many tens

1197
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,370
of millions of years old,
there's no coming back from that,

1198
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:38,830
right?
Well back to the bacteria for a second 

1199
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:39,800
because it's a good observation and I 
saw a murmuration of starlings last week

1200
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:44,801
in Buffalo,
New York when I was up there for 

1201
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:44,801
thanksgiving.
In other words,

1202
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,940
groups have probably only about 200 
starlings,

1203
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:50,810
but those groups can become a million 
and they all know what to do.

1204
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,510
They know how to wheel around in a much 
broader pattern,

1205
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,220
but it all goes back to the bacteria 
because bacteria living groups,

1206
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,280
a group in the colony,
the size of your palm is 7 trillion,

1207
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,160
which is more than all the humans who 
have ever lived.

1208
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:10,490
Now there are bacteria like a Reuben,
Osa which come into your body and when 

1209
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,210
there are small numbers of them lay very
low,

1210
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,640
but they're constantly monitoring to see
how many of them there are and when will

1211
01:05:17,641 --> 01:05:22,641
they get up to a sufficient number,
whammo they grow through a massive 

1212
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:23,650
change and basically it's as if they're 
saying,

1213
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:28,651
okay,
now we're big enough to take Jordan 

1214
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:29,980
apart and they become infectious and 
they create disease,

1215
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:34,510
but they don't do that until quorum 
sensing tells them that there are enough

1216
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:35,620
of them to do that.

1217
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,670
So,
so is that.

1218
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:43,740
Does that explain why people can harbor 
con continue levels of toxic bacteria in

1219
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:47,560
their bodies without ever falling prey 
to disease?

1220
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:51,580
Is it a matter of the fact that they,
that they don't hit that core number and

1221
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,660
that they're monitoring that constantly?
No.

1222
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,680
We have a lot of bacteria that have 
adapted to living synergistically with 

1223
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,131
us and actually do are digesting.
You go down to the market because you 

1224
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:05,731
have a craving for chocolate eclairs and
you come back home and you eat one of 

1225
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:08,050
the chocolate eclairs and it's not you 
who's digesting the chocolate eclair.

1226
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:13,290
You have just acted as a transportation 
mechanism to feed a bunch of bacteria in

1227
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:18,511
your gut who will digest that chocolate 
eclair and what they shit out his 

1228
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:19,610
glucose.
Right?

1229
01:06:19,611 --> 01:06:20,220
Well,
it may me.

1230
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,720
It may also not be used.
It's craving the damage,

1231
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:27,760
claire,
but the background and the fact is that 

1232
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:27,910
the bacteria were just at the beginning 
of this research,

1233
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:30,870
but bacteria have an ability to 
influence your behavior.

1234
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,140
Exactly.
Exactly.

1235
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,300
Noted far more than we think.
Right?

1236
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:38,620
Exactly.
So and to engineer in a fine point,

1237
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:43,621
fashion your behavior,
should they so choose basic ideas that 

1238
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:46,180
bacteria have been through this business
of living in vast,

1239
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:51,181
vast multitude before and they have 
certain social evolve social behaviors,

1240
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:55,570
but turn them into effective groups that
allow them to constantly find new food.

1241
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,960
I'm constantly find new housing and if 
we think these things are strange to us 

1242
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,030
because in the 100,000
years since we become Homo Sapiens,

1243
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:10,170
we've never had such a thing until the 
last century were crazy because our 

1244
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:14,191
ancestors left us 40 percent of our 
genes and it is very likely that it 

1245
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:18,271
encoded in those genes is a whole world 
of how you behave when there are the 

1246
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:23,281
kinds of vast masses of tens of millions
that you were talking about on the cob 

1247
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:27,250
behavior or the $20 million who are in 
Mexico City or in major cities in China.

1248
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,180
Part of our genetic potential that's 
there not as consequences of human 

1249
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:33,550
evolution,
but it's something that preceded that.

1250
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:34,840
Right?
Exactly.

1251
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,860
But it's a guest.
This is a hypothesis at the moment.

1252
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,420
Let's go back.
Let's go back to you were,

1253
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,440
you left your biographical story at the 
point where you had finished,

1254
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,090
uh,
the art magazine and being successful at

1255
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:51,430
that and then were introduced into the 
FM stations.

1256
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:56,431
And so the beginning of the PR firms.
So just to mention it again,

1257
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,760
we're actually here talking about how I 
accidentally started the six cs and 

1258
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,700
we've skipped over the whole story of 
how I accidentally started the six days.

1259
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:05,110
Well,
we'll get a chance to talk.

1260
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:07,930
We'll get a chance to talk again,
I think because obviously there's things

1261
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,210
we could talk about for a very long 
period of time.

1262
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,120
Oh good.
So basically there I was,

1263
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,440
um,
helping get progressive radio off the 

1264
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,860
ground and I'm also,
when I was 12,

1265
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,190
I'm a girl,
had turned her eyes to mine,

1266
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,970
was eighth grade.

1267
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,970
She turned her eyes to mine and I was 
startled because no girl had ever done 

1268
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:34,061
that before.
And in fact then she locked into eye 

1269
01:08:34,061 --> 01:08:35,180
contact and I was even more startled 
because I,

1270
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,170
that had never happened before either.
And,

1271
01:08:38,171 --> 01:08:39,290
um,
and she said,

1272
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,930
I told my mother,
you understand the theory of relativity.

1273
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,200
Now remember,
I had been in science for two years at 

1274
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:47,200
this point,
reading two books a day.

1275
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,900
I had annealed copper.
I had made coils.

1276
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,780
I had made cold cream from an industrial
formula.

1277
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,840
Um,
I had built my or a top design,

1278
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:01,310
my first computer and it won several,
a science fair awards and I had built my

1279
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,020
first Boolean Algebra machine.
Oh.

1280
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:08,410
And my mom had schlepped me off to the 
University of Buffalo to sit down for 

1281
01:09:08,631 --> 01:09:13,631
meetings with the head of the graduate 
physics department at the University of 

1282
01:09:13,631 --> 01:09:14,960
Buffalo,
which was probably a courtesy call,

1283
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:16,610
but he was going to allow me five 
minutes,

1284
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:21,611
four and I was in there for an hour and 
we discussed the hottest topic of the 

1285
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:25,601
time,
which was the interpretation of the 

1286
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:26,270
doppler shift and big bang versus steady
state theory of cosmology.

1287
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,300
That's why he kept me in there because 
it was the very year when the chief 

1288
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,560
champion of steady state theory,
Fred Hoyle knew with absolute certainty 

1289
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,230
he was about to demolish drawers.
GAM loves theory of the Big Bang,

1290
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,500
and it would never be heard from again.
So this was the hottest topic in 

1291
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,680
science.
And when we got out,

1292
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,910
the guy towered over my head and he put 
my Santa,

1293
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:52,911
my shoulder and he said to my mom,
you don't have to study for Grad school 

1294
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:53,630
or you don't have to save up red school 
for him.

1295
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,590
He will get graduate fellowships at any 
university in.

1296
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:02,390
He wants in theoretical physics.
So it's a good day.

1297
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,750
That's a good day.
So I had a history in science already.

1298
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,230
And,
and when this girl turned arise to mind,

1299
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,180
she said,
I told my mother that you understand the

1300
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:14,600
theory of relativity and I couldn't 
confess Jordan,

1301
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,400
even though truth,
the truth at any price,

1302
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:19,130
including the price of your life,
is the first rule of science for me.

1303
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:24,400
I couldn't confess that I didn't know 
that because what did I have going for 

1304
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:24,400
me?

1305
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,950
God will forgive you for that.
Well.

1306
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:32,951
So I jumped on my bicycle and I went 
down to the library and the librarians 

1307
01:10:32,951 --> 01:10:33,650
literally knew me better than my mother 
did.

1308
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:38,651
And I said,
give me everything you've got on 

1309
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,331
relativity.
And they shoved to books across the 

1310
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:40,910
desk.
Get me a great big fat book by Einstein.

1311
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:44,990
And two collaborators and a little 
skinny book by Einstein all by himself.

1312
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,010
And I started with the big fat book 
because I'd learned at that point in the

1313
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:54,011
life that if you go through something 
you don't understand at all and you 

1314
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:55,460
shove yourself all the way to the bitter
vicious end,

1315
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,780
by the end you come out understanding 
something if only on a gut level.

1316
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,750
So I was doing that with the big book 
and the big bulk head,

1317
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:04,760
about seven words of English on each 
page.

1318
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:09,910
And the rest was all mathematical 
equations and mathematical equations or 

1319
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,910
Greek to me.

1320
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,530
I've never understood the.
So at 8:00

1321
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:17,531
at night I suddenly realized I'm only 50
pages into this book and my mom's going 

1322
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:18,300
to put me asleep at 10:00
tonight.

1323
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:23,540
And if I don't go to school,
understanding the theory of relativity 

1324
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:23,540
tomorrow,
I'm going to be humiliated.

1325
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:28,370
So I turned to the little skinny book 
and it was written just by Einstein all 

1326
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:33,201
on his own.
And there was an introduction to the 

1327
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:35,511
book and sometimes it feels as if the 
author is stepping out through the 

1328
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:36,090
pages,
grabbing you by the lapel.

1329
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:40,200
Putting his nose to yours and shouting a
personal message and in your face,

1330
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:45,860
and that's how it felt.
Einstein grabbed me by the lapels and 

1331
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,260
said,
listen,

1332
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:52,270
if you want to be a genius,
it's not enough to come up with a 

1333
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:55,011
theory.
Only seven men in the world can 

1334
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:55,011
understand to be a genius.

1335
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:58,580
You have to be able to come up with that
theory and express it so clearly that 

1336
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,331
anyone with a high school education and 
a reasonable degree of intelligence can 

1337
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:05,961
understand it.
So Albert Einstein had told me to be a 

1338
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:10,341
writer and so I was operating a writing 
career while I was in undergraduate 

1339
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:16,671
school and then advancing it when I was.
When I started the art studio is the 

1340
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:20,210
goal for me at that point was your next 
step to be the writer.

1341
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,430
Albert Einstein told you to be is you 
would have to write for magazines.

1342
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,130
And one day I walked into the office of 
a magazine carrying them portfolio,

1343
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,920
my art studio,
and wearing an outfit that I bought from

1344
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:36,921
a designer that I was collaborating with
them designing stuff and they have women

1345
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:42,950
at this magazine.
It was a load around magazine called 

1346
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,950
rags and underground fashion magazine.

1347
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:46,920
It was a bank rolled by one of the 
people who bank rolled rolling stone and

1348
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:51,921
the women didn't look at my portfolio.
All they looked at was what I was 

1349
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:53,490
wearing.
And they said,

1350
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:55,290
do you have more of those?
And I said,

1351
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:56,850
yes,
I've got a whole closet full of them.

1352
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,850
And they said,
can you write an article about that?

1353
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,950
Well,
I had been looking for my big break with

1354
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,430
magazine writing.
Einstein's imperative.

1355
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:06,970
Was that my back?
Um,

1356
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,520
so I said,
of course I can.

1357
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:11,490
And I wrote an article and then I became
a contributing editor on the road.

1358
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:16,491
One hundred and 75 pieces for them.
And then one of the contributing editors

1359
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:21,570
are ordered a new magazine called 
natural lifestyles and it may be a 

1360
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:25,311
contributing editor there too,
which meant I was getting up at six in 

1361
01:13:25,311 --> 01:13:27,480
the morning going without a stitch of 
clothes on to an old Remington,

1362
01:13:27,481 --> 01:13:32,481
1940 is non electric typewriter,
pounding away at writing until eight or 

1363
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:34,440
nine going into the art studio.

1364
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,080
Getting that up and running and then 
coming back home.

1365
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:39,420
And sitting there with a pot of coffee 
until 11:00

1366
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:43,290
at night when I put myself to sleep and 
I was getting tired of this Jordan.

1367
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,940
It had been going on for a year.
So because of the national lampoon,

1368
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:50,820
because there was a great big steady 
check coming in every month.

1369
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:56,240
My artists voted me out of my studio.
They didn't want to pay me the 

1370
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,301
percentage that they owed me.
And for me that was like getting sick.

1371
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:04,470
It was a fortunate thing because I had 
been there for three years and I could 

1372
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:08,550
have continued there forever running 
this art studio and um,

1373
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,650
and.
But I was busy writing and one day I was

1374
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:16,120
covering of all things a parapsychology 
convention for natural lifestyles.

1375
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:19,000
The other magazine,
I was a contributing editor to sue and I

1376
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,420
was taking notes frantically because I 
have no memory if I don't know that it's

1377
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,890
going to disappear.

1378
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,850
And somebody walked up to me and said,
do you want to edit a magazine?

1379
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:33,630
Well,
in my app between my freshman and my 

1380
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:36,121
sophomore year of college,
I had gotten a job writing for the boy 

1381
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:37,200
scouts of America.
And Britain there,

1382
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,520
their chapter,
I've rewritten their chapter on 

1383
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,581
masturbation for the boy scout handbook 
and I'd written that chapters in your 

1384
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:49,281
cv.
You have somehow that keeps showing up 

1385
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:49,540
and,
and uh,

1386
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:54,780
cause cause remember when I,
when I first got onto science at the 

1387
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,111
Asia tenant was because of bulk appeared
in my lap and it said the first two 

1388
01:14:58,111 --> 01:15:00,280
rules of science are these truth at any 
price and the price of your life.

1389
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,520
And it told the story of Galileo and it 
told it all wrong and told it as if he 

1390
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,630
had been a Giordano Bruno and been 
willing to go to the steak.

1391
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,590
No,
that's not true.

1392
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:14,250
Then the second rule of science was look
at things right under the noses if 

1393
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:14,830
you've never seen them before.
And then proceed from there.

1394
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,040
And it gave the story of Anton van 
Leeuwenhoek who invented the microscope 

1395
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,491
and looked at pond water and discovered 
these tiny little things called 

1396
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:26,320
animalcules microscopic beings.
And he also looked at human sperm.

1397
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,680
And then he'd written a letter to the 
royal society describing what he had 

1398
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,280
seen.
Now think about that Jordan.

1399
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:38,281
If it took 30 years before I realized 
where he'd probably gotten the humans 

1400
01:15:38,281 --> 01:15:42,621
from,
and he's confessing this to the Royal 

1401
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,270
Society story,
right?

1402
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:46,660
So masturbation kept following me 
wherever I went,

1403
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:52,050
but I wrote the,
a boy scout book on camouflage that is 

1404
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:52,750
there a handbook on camouflage and their
handbook,

1405
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,290
they're on stocking,
attracting,

1406
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,300
and I had been thrown out of boy scouts 
at the age of 11,

1407
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:03,620
competence of Morse Code,
the only child I have ever heard of who 

1408
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,410
has been thrown out of the boy scouts.

1409
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:08,740
So.
And so I have learned a lesson.

1410
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:12,220
And the lesson was if I care enough 
about my audience,

1411
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:17,221
if I want my audience to be able to drop
down on all fours and get so close to a 

1412
01:16:17,221 --> 01:16:18,820
bunny rabbit using the techniques of 
stalking and tracking.

1413
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:22,750
But I teach them that the rabbit doesn't
know they're there until they're rubbing

1414
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:24,610
noses with it,
um,

1415
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:30,210
that I can write anything.
So I didn't ask what the magazine was 

1416
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,480
about.
When this kid walked up to me and said,

1417
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:35,020
you want to edit a magazine?
And we didn't have google in those days.

1418
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:39,130
So I had the name of the publisher that 
I was supposed to set up a meeting with,

1419
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,520
but I had no idea who he was and there 
was no way to look him up and I had no 

1420
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,220
idea what his magazine was.
I walked into his office to editors.

1421
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:53,220
We're in the process of packing up their
stuff and leave it on the opposite side 

1422
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:57,391
of his office suite from his office.
And I knew nothing about rock and roll.

1423
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:03,661
It turned out that the magazine was 
called Circus and it was a rock'n'roll 

1424
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:03,661
magazine.
And um,

1425
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,190
he asked,
he asked only one question,

1426
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,290
can you turn out a magazine in two 
weeks,

1427
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,640
because he had two weeks before he had 
to deliver his magazines and the printer

1428
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:17,450
and his editors were leaving.
And I said yes.

1429
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,030
And I turned out the magazine in two 
weeks.

1430
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,820
And that's how I became the editor of a 
rock magazine.

1431
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,300
And,
and over the course of time applying 

1432
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,230
Martin gardeners approach to things,
looking for underlying correlations,

1433
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,560
I invented all kinds of correlational 
studies that allowed me to get a handle 

1434
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,091
on my audience.
And I learned that my audience wasn't 

1435
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:43,751
interested in the traditional format of 
the Rock magazine and my publisher 

1436
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:47,711
adhere to,
which is only cover a band that's of 

1437
01:17:47,711 --> 01:17:47,711
interest to your audience.

1438
01:17:47,711 --> 01:17:51,070
Once a year,
I discovered that like the audience for 

1439
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:53,950
Time magazine,
which my boss wanted me to imitate and 

1440
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,910
which I read from cover to cover when I 
was a child.

1441
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,280
Um,
Time magazine has an article of a 

1442
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,000
president not once a year,
every single week,

1443
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:07,060
it's a running soap opera.
And if they have a secondary character 

1444
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,900
like Henry Kissinger,
he's in there at least every other week.

1445
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:12,860
And then there are tertiary characters 
who may show up once every four months.

1446
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,280
But you need that star trek that a 
track,

1447
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:19,130
that presidential track.
And I discovered that my,

1448
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:24,670
that I had one artist that was twice as 
popular with my audience as his nearest 

1449
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:26,670
runner up.
That was.

1450
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:32,100
And that was Alice Cooper.
And the closest runner up was David 

1451
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,690
Bowie.
David Bowie looked pathetic by 

1452
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,560
comparison with Alice Cooper.
So I went to my publisher and I,

1453
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,800
I'd taken the sales figures and I'd 
worked out additional correlations like 

1454
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,050
the fact that if we had cover lines,
um,

1455
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:48,500
about people who were in the top 10 on 
the album charts the week we came out,

1456
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:53,501
we sold magazines,
which means that with a four month lead 

1457
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:56,261
time I had to learn to predict what was 
going to be in the top 10 on the album 

1458
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:57,710
charts for months in advance.

1459
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:02,780
So I went to my publisher,
I had a complete format for him.

1460
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:07,781
I said,
I guarantee you this is only one of 

1461
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:07,781
three statements of this kind I've ever 
made in my life.

1462
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:10,520
I guarantee you that if you use this 
format,

1463
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,950
we will increase the sales of our 
magazine.

1464
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,030
And he was kind enough to let me get 
away with a total overhaul.

1465
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:20,150
And the result was we increased in the 
next 12 months,

1466
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:22,520
buy 200,
11 percent.

1467
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:26,450
And my publisher went from a man of 
modest means with an apartment on second

1468
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:31,320
avenue overlooking the traffic to a band
of immodest means with a huge aircraft.

1469
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,760
Saw anger size apartment overlooking the
East River.

1470
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,800
Um,
and,

1471
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:41,820
and chef flip over one of the founding 
editors of rolling stone to validate 

1472
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,410
himself.
He didn't feel well rolling,

1473
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:47,411
stone validated,
sufficiently did a history of rock and 

1474
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:50,780
roll journalism for his Masters thesis 
at the University of Texas at Austin.

1475
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:56,110
And he sent me six pages by Messenger 
one day and it was about this guy 

1476
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:01,001
working in a little windowless closet 
with a manual remington typewriter 

1477
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:02,930
singlehandedly pounding out of a 
magazine.

1478
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,140
And he said,
single handedly inventing a new 

1479
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,700
magazine,
the heavy metal magazine.

1480
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:12,270
So that's how I became a scholar of rock
and roll.

1481
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,910
I mean,
I buy.

1482
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,380
Did you develop an acidity for the 
music?

1483
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,180
Yes,
I fucking love it.

1484
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,110
I had,
who's favorite?

1485
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:25,460
Well,
my favorite before this have been 

1486
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,641
Vivaldi's winter in the four seasons 
because it's angry and scowling and whip

1487
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:33,360
lashing.
And now my favorites became,

1488
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:38,361
well,
my favorite as a person was Michael 

1489
01:20:38,361 --> 01:20:41,150
Jackson because I never met anybody like
him in my life and never expected to 

1490
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:44,271
meet anybody like him.
And he embodied the first two rules of 

1491
01:20:44,271 --> 01:20:46,380
science in a way that none of the 
science people that I've known and loved

1492
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,570
have ever embodied it.

1493
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:49,910
And,
um,

1494
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,810
my favorites musically right now,
I mean they've changed over the years.

1495
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,810
One day I was driving a rental car on 
sunset boulevard in Hollywood.

1496
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,200
And a song came on the radio that made 
me do something I'd never done since I'd

1497
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,890
never done before and I've never done 
since.

1498
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:13,220
I had to pull the car over to a side,
the side of the road and stop and do 

1499
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:16,810
nothing but listen to this song and it 
was hurt.

1500
01:21:16,811 --> 01:21:21,570
So good by John Mellencamp.
So Billy Joel,

1501
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:26,571
I loved him and his angry period.
But I came to him after his angry period

1502
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:30,540
and one day I wanted to get together 
with them socially because I hadn't seen

1503
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,090
him in a long time.
And I don't socialize very readily.

1504
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,640
I,
I like to get together to work together,

1505
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,370
but not necessarily to schmooze 
together.

1506
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:42,510
But I did call him for socializing.
So we met for breakfast,

1507
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,760
uh,
at a restaurant,

1508
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:47,470
at the outdoor cafe,
part of restaurant on the ground,

1509
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,520
ground floor of the Essex House where he
had an apartment and he came down the 

1510
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,661
elevator carrying this child's notebook,
you know how when you're in first and 

1511
01:21:56,661 --> 01:22:00,951
second grade,
your parents buy you a black covered 

1512
01:22:00,951 --> 01:22:02,220
marbled with white notebook to write in.

1513
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,010
Well,
he had one of those and he put it in the

1514
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:10,011
middle of the table while we were 
talking and he explained something and 

1515
01:22:10,011 --> 01:22:13,641
he said when I was growing up and we 
were teenagers and we would hang out on 

1516
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:17,420
the corner just watching all the girls 
go by,

1517
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:20,030
um,
girls to us.

1518
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:25,040
We're a separate species.
They were like mules or donkeys or dogs 

1519
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,990
or something like that.
If we had anything to do with them.

1520
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:32,991
The simple goal was to score.
We assumed that they didn't have brains 

1521
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:34,920
like ours.
And I met a girl last night,

1522
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:39,921
billy said,
who utterly defied those rules of what 

1523
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:42,000
girls are.
She is articulate,

1524
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:44,430
she is intelligent,
she is on top of things.

1525
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:48,360
She was a pleasure to talk to.
Now Billy had informed me the first time

1526
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:53,361
I met him at his home,
I'm out on a oyster bay that had a piano

1527
01:22:54,121 --> 01:22:59,121
room and it had a big grand piano and he
explained that at that writing Sol,

1528
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:03,270
this was like pulling teeth that 
sometimes just took them three months to

1529
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:08,271
write a song that he would pace back and
forth panel room and he would call his 

1530
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:09,340
piano the beast with Ada teeth.

1531
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,680
It was the BC was fighting to get songs 
out.

1532
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:17,070
Well,
billy explained that after coming home 

1533
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:17,070
at two in the morning for meeting this 
astonishing woman,

1534
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,980
he had sat down with this little 
notebook and he had written an entire 

1535
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:27,680
album full of songs.
He made his views it.

1536
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,660
Yes.
And it was Christie Brinkley and yes.

1537
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,760
And you could see how she might inspire.
So under two.

1538
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,040
Yes,
absolutely.

1539
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,000
But the point is that it was billy's 
most vapid album,

1540
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:42,730
at least to me,
that I'd ever heard from him.

1541
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:46,260
And it's an album that I really am not 
interested in listening to,

1542
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,120
but his angry period when he was angry 
with his first wife,

1543
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:50,510
Elizabeth.
Um,

1544
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,900
hey,
those were really,

1545
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,860
really good songs.
Paul Simon astonished me.

1546
01:23:56,861 --> 01:24:00,150
One day I was in the elevator over at 
the Broadway,

1547
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:05,220
whatever it's called,
building Broadway studios or somebody 

1548
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,010
that I have the building he owns with 
Lauren michaels of Saturday night live.

1549
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,390
I was in the elevator and I bumped into 
Paul who was my client.

1550
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:14,620
I did Simon and Garfunkel reunion tour 
in the part or reunion in the park.

1551
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:18,580
And then I did Simon and Garfunkel,
his reunion tour and um,

1552
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:23,020
and Paul had a piece of paper in his 
hand and I said,

1553
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:23,860
what's that?
And he said,

1554
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,780
it's lyrics roy next album.
Now remember,

1555
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,020
I was so heavily in the poetry,
the poetry changed in the nature of my 

1556
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,291
life when I was 14 to 16 years old and 
that I was the editor of a literary 

1557
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:38,170
magazine that won two National Academy 
of Poets Prizes in addition to the store

1558
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:41,890
caused in the art community.
So I asked if I could see the lyrics.

1559
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,030
It's hard to describe this,
but when I read the lyrics,

1560
01:24:46,031 --> 01:24:51,031
my knees almost buckled,
which almost felt the floor bones and 

1561
01:24:51,031 --> 01:24:51,760
stones or something like that.

1562
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,760
I'm terrible with album names.
It was some of the most astonishing 

1563
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,841
poetry I'd ever ever read in my life and
it reached so deep into me that I've 

1564
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,140
literally was losing control of my body.
Um,

1565
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:10,350
so I asked him if he minded if I showed 
these to the lyrics to one friend,

1566
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:15,010
just one friend at the New York Times.
And so he,

1567
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:20,040
we went into his office,
we made a xerox and I walked out with 

1568
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,670
the Xerox of the lyrics.
Now I had learned that the,

1569
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,720
that the media is like sheep and that if
you can take one of the lead shape and 

1570
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:32,011
turn him in your direction that you can 
change the perception of an artist 

1571
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:37,740
within the critical community.
And I had a friend who was an outsider 

1572
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:42,330
and yet a lead sheet because he was at 
the New York Times and he was an 

1573
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,780
outsider because he was gay before you 
could admit that you were gay.

1574
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,970
So even I didn't know that he was gay.
I just trust no,

1575
01:25:46,971 --> 01:25:51,370
he was a little bit strange and that I,
as a consequence felt protective of him.

1576
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,690
And I called him and said,
I have just seen the most amazing lyrics

1577
01:25:55,691 --> 01:26:00,691
I've ever seen in my life,
but for all I know it's an illusion for 

1578
01:26:00,691 --> 01:26:02,140
all I know.
I have somehow hyped myself into this.

1579
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,050
If I send you the lyrics,
can you tell me if I'm crazy?

1580
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,530
And two hours later I send it to them by
Messenger.

1581
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,930
In two hours later I got a phone call 
saying,

1582
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:16,990
you are not crazy.
So Paul Simon has amazing astonishing 

1583
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:21,740
gifts.
And beyond that,

1584
01:26:21,741 --> 01:26:24,830
I mean I love rock and roll and blues 
based service.

1585
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:29,750
So these days I'm listening to Joe 
Bonamassa and Johnny Lang and Beth Hart,

1586
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,120
who I think is the best vocalist I've 
ever heard in my life.

1587
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:35,600
Yeah,
Beth Hart is just amazing.

1588
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,830
She takes everything that,
uh,

1589
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:42,831
at uh,
James did and everything that Janis 

1590
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,420
joplin builds on the,
on the base of what I had james had done

1591
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:49,750
and takes it five levels beyond what 
whoever thought any vocals could ever 

1592
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:52,820
made your praise because there's editor 
James was quite the creature.

1593
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:56,090
She really was.
She was an original.

1594
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,090
So that's.
But,

1595
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:00,920
but we skipped the story of how I 
accidentally started the six days.

1596
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,790
Let's do that.
That's a good place to stop.

1597
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:08,630
I think because we got into.
Well,

1598
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:11,510
we completed the story.
We completed that story.

1599
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:17,410
I would love to talk to you again.
It was an absolutely great conversation 

1600
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:20,940
and for me it's a privilege because I 
love your thinking about Muse,

1601
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:25,990
about religion in terms of its 
underlying archetypes because that's a 

1602
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:30,101
part of my life quest.
But you've gone out and explored a part 

1603
01:27:30,101 --> 01:27:32,510
that I would never have had the time to 
explore with a mind that's yours.

1604
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:35,000
And so it's going to be different than 
mine.

1605
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:37,930
So I will download the PDF.
I'm hope.

1606
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:38,880
I hope that.
Well,

1607
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,970
especially because you've read the 
second book,

1608
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:43,700
there's 12 rules for life that should 
open up maps of meaning,

1609
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:45,670
if which is a much more.
Um,

1610
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:50,000
I would say it's a much denser book.
It's probably not as well written,

1611
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,300
although I think it's,
it's,

1612
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,800
I'm not complaining about it.
It it accomplish the goal that I'd set 

1613
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:56,800
out to accomplish,
which was,

1614
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,110
well,
you'll,

1615
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:02,300
you,
you've experienced some of it with 12 

1616
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,391
rules for life and I'd be very 
interested to hear what you have to say 

1617
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:07,091
about maps of meaning.
So let's talk again while you're going 

1618
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:07,520
to talk to me.
I think in January that was the plan,

1619
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:08,480
right?
Um,

1620
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:10,640
yes,
we were in a talk in January or February

1621
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:14,570
when the bankers out sat in another talk
somewhere.

1622
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,580
Um,
yeah.

1623
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,410
Are you in New York?
I'm in New York.

1624
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:20,090
I'm sitting here in park slope,
Brooklyn.

1625
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,340
Well,
maybe if you wouldn't mind the next time

1626
01:28:22,341 --> 01:28:24,990
I come down to New York,
we really.

1627
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,030
Yes,
yes,

1628
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:31,031
yes.
Let me know as far in advance as 

1629
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:31,130
possible because my gala and we'll do 
it.

1630
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:31,930
Okay,
good.

1631
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:33,210
I love that.
Okay.

1632
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,170
You've been a pleasure.
It's been really good talking to you and

1633
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:36,990
it was,
it was,

1634
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,610
it was really a lot of fun and you're,
you're,

1635
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:43,600
you're an amazing font of stories and,
and interesting tangents and,

1636
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,700
and crazy schemes and adventures.
It's really,

1637
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,650
like I said,
if you didn't exist,

1638
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:50,780
it would be hard to.
Hard to invent you,

1639
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:53,180
so I shall see you sometime in the next 
two months.

1640
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,470
Good.
All right.

1641
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:55,790
Thanks Jordan.
You have a great night.

1642
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,650
Okay,

1643
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,440
Bye.
