00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,880
Dr richard,
higher studies the neural basis of human

2
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,881
intelligence and cognition.
He works with neuroimaging technologies 

3
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,260
to study individual differences in 
mental ability.

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,190
He received his phd in psychology from 
the Johns Hopkins University in Nineteen

5
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:39,191
75 and has since held appointments in 
the intramural research program at the 

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
National Institute of Mental Health and 
the medical school at Brown University 

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
and the University of California at 
Irvine Irvine.

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,060
He has served on the editorial board or 
three journals,

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,120
neuro,
image intelligence and psychiatry 

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,941
research.
He also served as guest editor for a 

11
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:58,760
special issue on brain imaging research 
for the journal intelligence.

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,480
He provides neuroscience consultation,
do university research groups,

13
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,460
corporations,
foundations,

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,930
and educational and legal professionals.
He's a popular lecturer and has appeared

15
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:13,931
in numerous media outlets in 2012.
His research was featured on Nova 

16
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:18,760
science now and he received the 
distinguished contributor award for the 

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,270
International Society for intelligence 
research.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,840
In 2013.
The teaching company invited Richard to 

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,710
create an 18 lecture course called the 
intelligent rate.

20
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,310
So welcome to Dr Richard.
Higher today and we're going to talk 

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,610
about the most controversy of all 
topics.

22
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:36,350
I would say in social science,
uh,

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,390
strangely enough intelligence,
so maybe we could start with a little 

24
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:47,381
bit of historical information.
I would like to know how you got 

25
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,090
interested in Iq research or 
intelligence research,

26
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:50,630
let's say.
And,

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,610
and,
and so let's start with that and then we

28
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,190
can start diving.
Diving into the nitty gritty.

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,870
Well,
really it started in graduate school at 

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,191
Hopkins when I really became most 
interested in personality research and I

31
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,770
started out studying individual 
differences in personality,

32
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,570
but just by happenstance,
the year I started graduate school in 

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,020
Nineteen 71 was the year one of the 
professors there,

34
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:25,021
Julian Stanley was study up 
mathematically precocious youth and I 

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,480
was one of the proctors at the very 
first challenge search for 

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,660
mathematically precocious kids.
And I wrote my first couple of papers as

37
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:42,640
book chapters in books that Stanley was 
editing about this project.

38
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,520
And I saw these,
these kids age 10,

39
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:50,521
11,
12 when we're scoring higher on sat 

40
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,400
math,
then hopkins freshmen.

41
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,400
And the question was how does this 
happen?

42
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:00,640
Where does this come from?
So now it's kind of my earliest interest

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,300
and in graduate school,
although I really completed my 

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,130
dissertation on personality,
uh,

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
I took my first job at the National 
Institute of Mental Health in the 

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,060
intramural research program in the 
laboratory and psychology and 

47
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,021
psychopathology,
which at the time the lab director was 

48
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,331
David Rosenthal who had just finished 
the Denmark adoption studies of 

49
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,390
schizophrenia.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Right.
And here is where I learned about 

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,991
genetics.
My office was next door to a fellow 

52
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,580
named Monte bucks bond who was doing it 
both for initial search,

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,540
very interested in that.
And so my,

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,640
my early interest in,
in,

55
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,790
in individual differences slowly morphed
into an interest in individual 

56
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:59,300
differences in intelligence and add nim 
age.

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,740
They were just going through a 
transition from kind of a 

58
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,011
psychoanalytic,
a orientation to a neuro science 

59
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:13,030
orientation and I was kind of caught up 
in that.

60
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:18,031
And so that's the origin of my interest 
in the brain in technologies to make 

61
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:24,370
brain measurements and relate that to 
individual differences.

62
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,270
Okay,
great.

63
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,710
Okay.
Now you just wrote a book too,

64
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,370
and the neuroscience of intelligence can
be a university press.

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,640
And so when did that come out?
That came out really just about six 

66
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,651
months ago,
so it came out I think in December of 

67
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:43,600
2016,
but they tell me for publishing reasons,

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,410
they call it a 2017 publication.

69
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,030
While I'm.
Part of the reason I was so excited to 

70
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,790
talk to you is that are done a very 
large amount of research,

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,280
especially not so much practical lab 
research,

72
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:01,090
but investigation into the structure of 
intelligence and into its measurement.

73
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,240
We designed back in [inaudible] 93 with 
a student of mine,

74
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,650
Daniel Higgins.
We designed,

75
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,640
well,
it was probably the first online battery

76
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:13,570
purporting to measure the cognitive 
abilities associated with dorsal lateral

77
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:14,980
prefrontal cortex.
Right?

78
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,520
So I had the highest order cognitive 
functions in the brain and we found,

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,230
much to our chagrin I would say,
and this was very painful discovery,

80
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:28,231
that a lot of what we have been thinking
about as potentially separable 

81
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,300
neuro-psychological functions were 
pretty easily collapsible,

82
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,160
collapsible into good old general 
intelligence.

83
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,340
You know,
that killer is central factor that seems

84
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,320
to cognitive abilities.
And so it was quite a shock,

85
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,470
especially because the neuro 
psychologists have the time and they 

86
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:46,470
still do this,
uh,

87
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:46,470
are,
are,

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,510
are as assiduous in investigators of the
psychometric intelligence literature is 

89
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,861
they should be intent to underestimate 
the central power of that in that 

90
00:05:58,861 --> 00:05:58,861
initial factor.

91
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:03,420
So anyways,
I'm really interested into intelligence 

92
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,560
research partly from a practical 
perspective too,

93
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:08,561
because the industrial organizational 
psychology literature is crystal clear 

94
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:12,731
for complex jobs.
The best predictor of longterm success 

95
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,300
is intelligence and it's a predictor 
that's probably

96
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,130
say imagine you give it an r of point 
four to point five,

97
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,160
which is pretty decent.
So let's say 25 percent of the variance,

98
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:27,161
the next best predictor is 
conscientiousness and it's pushing it's 

99
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,450
limit at mopping up 10 percent of the 
variability in longterm performance.

100
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,360
So Iq,
it's a killer man.

101
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,390
And if we,
I make sure my students assess 

102
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,241
intelligence with everything they do and
it always ends up being a major 

103
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:40,670
predictor of things that you wouldn't 
even expect.

104
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:45,080
Like disgust sensitivity for example.
So your disgust sensitivity is higher if

105
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,190
you have a lower Iq,

106
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,430
the g factor is powerful.
You just said something though that I 

107
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,060
want to just make a distinction about 
you.

108
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,820
We're talking about the g factor and 
then you kind of called it Iq.

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,750
This is very common in everyday language
to talk about intelligence Iq in what we

110
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:10,640
call the g factor as one thing and it 
really isn't.

111
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:15,641
So an Iq score is a good estimate of the
g factor also includes other aspects of 

112
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:22,791
intelligence and intelligence in itself,
although as a broad term is only a part 

113
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,650
of the universe of mental abilities,
so if you are very good at calculating 

114
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,630
on what day?
January fifth was in the year,

115
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,990
15,
20.

116
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,230
That's a mental ability that some people
have.

117
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,630
It doesn't mean you're smart,
right?

118
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,280
With autistic survived so often and that
they're often but

119
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,650
sufficiently often they have these 
amazing calculus calculation abilities 

120
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,521
for example,
that don't seem to be manifest in a 

121
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:57,730
spectacularly high overall intelligence.
Well,

122
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:59,710
so what do you.
What do you want to tell us about?

123
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,290
You want to start with the book and and 
walk us through it.

124
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,180
Well,
you know that's interesting because the 

125
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,201
book is kind of a culmination of things.
I've learned mostly from my neuroimaging

126
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,770
work on intelligence and it kind of came
as a surprise,

127
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:24,060
is the first book I've ever written.
I'm now retired actually from academia,

128
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,650
never wrote a book while I was in 
academia is writing journal papers,

129
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,140
uh,
but Cambridge University press called 

130
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,711
and they have this series of 
fundamentals of neuroscience and they 

131
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:42,141
wanted to include intelligence and I 
regarded that as a major step because 

132
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:49,210
intelligence research really has been 
relegated almost to a,

133
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,350
the peripheral of mainstream psychology 
politically to say the least.

134
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,110
Yeah.
And you know,

135
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,590
the switch happened overnight from being
in the mainstream to being really 

136
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
peripheral in about 1969 before 1969.
Uh,

137
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,070
almost everyone who was interested in 
education was concerned about the 

138
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:23,241
achievement gaps and they felt 
universally that once you equalized 

139
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,780
educational opportunities,
those achievement gaps would disappear.

140
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,930
Yeah.
That was the head start head start.

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,940
Yeah.
Even before headstart,

142
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,620
headstart came to head start,
but even before headstart,

143
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,840
there were all these demonstration 
projects.

144
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,030
That was one of the miracle in 
Milwaukee.

145
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:51,031
And there were all these things that 
showed that if you really intervened in 

146
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,650
early childhood education.
Yep,

147
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,770
which at that time was called 
compensatory education.

148
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,870
The early childhood education term came 
much later,

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,320
but this idea of compensatory education 
really took off and then in 1969,

150
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,020
the harvard educational review asked one
of the foremost educational 

151
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,271
psychologist,
Arthur Jensen to write a review of the 

152
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,841
progress and this article in 1969 is 
become infamous.

153
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:27,091
The opening sentence was essentially 
we've tried compensatory education and 

154
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:32,131
it has failed,
and then he had 100 pages of detailed 

155
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,690
statistical analysis of why there were 
no.

156
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,190
You couldn't demonstrate an increase in 
Iq score and any of these programs now 

157
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,780
headstart had had just begun.
So headstart wasn't included.

158
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:44,810
Yeah,
but I,

159
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,811
you know,
I reviewed the literature on headstart 

160
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:49,811
to extensively and basically what 
happened was that the.

161
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,580
So that was for those viewers who don't 
know,

162
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:57,581
headstart was a nationwide attempt to,
to add additional education to the lives

163
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:02,270
of disadvantaged kids especially,
you know,

164
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,910
at the preschool level.
And basically what happened was that 

165
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,450
they actually did show improvements in 
academic achievement initially.

166
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,990
So in grade one and grade two,
they were performing above their peers.

167
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:19,040
But then the difference in improvement,
the difference in performance started to

168
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,100
decrease and then my grade grade five,
grade six,

169
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,140
that differences in disappeared 
completely,

170
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,420
so there was no evidence whatsoever of 
that,

171
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,510
of that either have a stable one time,
longterm gain in cognitive ability or 

172
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:37,541
what people were really hoping was that 
if you intervene early enough you get 

173
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,530
something that would sort of,
Paul would turn into a positive feedback

174
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,680
loop and the gains would actually 
advance across time.

175
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,680
And what ended up happening with the 
headstart research basically was the 

176
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,730
conclusion that it produced no cognitive
improvements whatsoever.

177
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,420
Although more kids who went through 
headstart,

178
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm graduated from high school,
fewer than were delinquent,

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
more of them,
fewer of them became pregnant teenage in

180
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:01,270
the teenage years and more of them went 
to colleges,

181
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:06,271
but that seemed to be because they were 
better socialized not because they were 

182
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,790
in any way.
It had been made smarter.

183
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,940
So that was a really tremendous 
disappointment because it was a 

184
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,130
bipartisan attempt to come to grips with
the fundamental issues that sort of beat

185
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,470
deviled structural poverty in the United
States.

186
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,870
No one was happy about that outcome.
I can tell you,

187
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,510
jetson published his article.
He also said that since I cue increases 

188
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:35,571
seemed not to be coming from these 
intense environmental interventions,

189
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,380
we should consider the possibility that 
these differences have a genetic 

190
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,431
component and that really began the 
incendiary descent of intelligent search

191
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,910
to the periphery,
to the reaction against that was 

192
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,390
universal.
Um,

193
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,270
because it implied inferiority.
If you building teams for Icu,

194
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,980
it's also something that's universally 
hated,

195
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,290
but on both sides of the political 
spectrum,

196
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,580
because on the liberal end,
you know,

197
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,670
the idea fundamentally is this,
that everybody's the same and that if 

198
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,531
you,
if you distribute educational resources 

199
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:19,261
property than everyone can succeed.
And so that didn't work out so well for 

200
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:19,810
liberals.
And then on the conservative side,

201
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,190
the idea is,
well,

202
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:24,010
if you could just get off your lazy ass 
and get a job,

203
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,820
there is a job for you out there.
And the truth of the matter is,

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,880
you know,
you can tell me what you think about 

205
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,741
this,
but this was a statistic that just 

206
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:36,451
absolutely shocked and staggered me when
I went through the Intel intelligence 

207
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:36,451
literature.
So you know,

208
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,640
it is illegal in the United States to 
induct anybody who has an Iq of less 

209
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,200
than 83 and the reason for that is you 
know that the American armed forces have

210
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:50,201
been conducting intelligence research 
for like more than 100 years and that 

211
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:54,481
was partly because they needed a way of 
sorting people rapidly during times of 

212
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:55,120
military expansion during war time.

213
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
But it was also because Iq tests and 
especially in the early part of the 20th

214
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:04,441
century were used to identify,
let's say the deserving poor who could 

215
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:08,521
really benefit from additional 
educational attainment and advancement 

216
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:12,121
and the unit and the military was hoping
to identify people from lower class 

217
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:16,711
strata that can be streamed into say,
officer training programs and so forth 

218
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,370
or,
or even skills training programs to to 

219
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,030
move people from the underclass into at 
least the working class and maybe above.

220
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,230
So they had a bloody stake in this man.
They wanted to find people,

221
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:34,231
they wanted to sort them properly and 
they wanted to do social good when they 

222
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:34,810
weren't just trying to win a war,
let's say.

223
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:39,190
Which often also is a social good.
But what happened was that by,

224
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,410
I don't remember when this legislation 
was introduced,

225
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:46,411
but it wasn't,
it was in the later part of the 20th 

226
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:46,411
century,
but there are basic finding,

227
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:50,641
was that by say the 19 eighties,
they had determined that if you had an 

228
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,270
Iq of less than 83,
there was not a damn thing that the unit

229
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,330
that the army could do,
the armed forces could do to transform 

230
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,721
you into someone who could do something 
that was more productive than 

231
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:02,210
nonproductive.

232
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,750
And the terrible thing about that is 
that it's about 10 percent of the 

233
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,721
population.
And so they look at a statistic like 

234
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:10,880
that and you think,
oh my God,

235
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,500
you've got this,
this,

236
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,900
this,
this enterprise,

237
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:18,380
this massive enterprise that's 
chronically hungry for people to write.

238
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,300
It's always,
they're always looking for people.

239
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
They're really oriented towards taking 
people from the underclass and lower 

240
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,051
working class and pushing them up the 
societal strata and during war time 

241
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,530
there actually desperate to bring in 
recruits,

242
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:35,531
period.
And their conclusion is the 10 percent 

243
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:36,470
of the population can't be trained to do
anything.

244
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,850
Anything sufficiently useful to make 
them militarily operable.

245
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,090
It's just,
I just read that my jaw just dropped.

246
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,560
It's like,

247
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,660
oh yeah.
In the United States we have about 330 

248
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,850
million people and because of the 
distribution,

249
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,240
the relatively normal distribution of Iq
scores,

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,480
about 16 percent.
Have I accuse of 85 or means they're not

251
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:04,790
going to graduate school?

252
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,500
No.
It means that from,

253
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:11,501
from what I've read practically,
it means the wonder this company has 

254
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,861
actually done a really.
They have a nice Iq tents from the 

255
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:14,861
commercial perspective,
you know,

256
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:18,361
it's actually psychometrically valid and
they've linked Iq levels to a job.

257
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,280
Specifically the job categories.

258
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,530
I know not a lot.
I was going to say they're not only not 

259
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,401
going to graduate school,
they're not going to find a a stable job

260
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,760
that pays a livable wage.

261
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Yeah.
Especially given that so many of the 

262
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,651
service jobs now require fair,
high degree of computational savvy or a 

263
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:42,810
built.
No,

264
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm not computation,
but ability to interact with complex 

265
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,081
computational technology typical till 
ladder at a checkout market or or the 

266
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,470
till at a Mcdonald's because Mcdonald's 
is actually very complicated.

267
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Is often far beyond the ability of 
people who are on the low end of the 

268
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,770
intelligence distribution and they 
claimed,

269
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,740
I think it was wonderlic,
although it might know it might've been.

270
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,550
It might've been hunt.
That's his name.

271
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,660
They.
He's a ICU researcher.

272
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:14,661
Is it earl haunts?
I think possibly what he claimed that if

273
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,120
you have an Iq of below 90 it,
it's,

274
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,180
it's difficult.
It's difficult for you to read well 

275
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,090
enough to translate what you're reading 
into action,

276
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,940
so you can't actually read instructions 
and follow them.

277
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,680
You don't have that level of literacy.

278
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,120
Yeah.
I was going to say that in,

279
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:37,121
in the United States,
this bottom 16 percent translates into 

280
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:43,501
51 million people,
including $13 million children who are 

281
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,070
in school.
This is a very difficult problem now.

282
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,510
I knew earl passed away when I knew him 
pretty well.

283
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,690
He also would say that there is this,
a cognitive segregation in society.

284
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:04,990
This is a point that Charles Murray 
makes and they often ask,

285
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:05,850
uh,
you know,

286
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:10,851
when's the last time you had someone 
over for dinner who wasn't a college 

287
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:10,851
Grad?

288
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,710
Well,
that was something that Marie and her 

289
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,710
starting wrote about in their book the 
bell curve,

290
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,680
which really struck me because I read 
that book twice,

291
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,220
unlike most of the people criticized it 
and you know,

292
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,010
we're one of the things that they 
pointed out in there,

293
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:24,490
it was,
look,

294
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,080
the typically a typical educated person 
thinks that someone isn't very bright if

295
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:36,170
they have an Iq of 150.
So how'd you at graduate level,

296
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,680
Phd Level Research Institutions,
right?

297
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:40,780
Because 115,
there's,

298
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,920
there's as many people at 150 and above 
as there are at 85 and below.

299
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
And so it's a minority of the population
and that's the top 15 percent.

300
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,350
And you know,
that's,

301
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,560
that's the dollar undergraduate,
right?

302
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:56,740
So people have.
See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've

303
00:18:56,741 --> 00:19:01,741
dealt with people who had,
I ranges in the low eighties and tried 

304
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,230
to find them jobs and tried to train 
them.

305
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:07,231
And I have some real knowledge about the
stunning gap between people at the low 

306
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,370
end of the ICU distribution in the high 
end.

307
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:10,960
And it's,
it's no bloody wonder.

308
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:15,961
People hate Iq research and intelligence
research because it reveals a set of 

309
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:16,240
seriously

310
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,080
a dismal

311
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,290
facts about the incredible range of 
ability among human beings.

312
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,790
Well,
yes,

313
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,620
this is true.
And moreover I would add to this that 

314
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,000
people in universities,
professors and graduate students have a 

315
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:41,310
hard time understanding what the,
what everyday life is like.

316
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,640
If you have an Iq of 84,
85 and we're making your way,

317
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:51,831
you're living independently.
You were making your way in the world 

318
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,490
five.
It is a challenge.

319
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,040
I mean,

320
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,100
just barely begins to describe it.
I had a,

321
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,290
I had a client who,
he probably had an Iq of under 80 and 

322
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,120
nonverbal portion of it anyways,
and um,

323
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,820
he was indistinguishable and physical 
appearance from,

324
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,690
from let's say,
I hate to use the frame normal person,

325
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:18,691
but there's nothing more that marked him
out about particularly intellectually 

326
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:18,691
impaired,
you know.

327
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,130
And uh,
I tried at one point,

328
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,520
this was so,
so telling to me,

329
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,240
I got him an inch,
a volunteer job,

330
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:33,241
which by the way is very difficult.
It's harder to get a volunteer job in a 

331
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,181
real job because you have to do police 
screening and all sorts of things and 

332
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:36,181
the selection process is just as 
extreme,

333
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:39,280
but I eventually ended up getting a job 
at a bike store,

334
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,440
bike slash bookstore,
and at that place couldn't hold him once

335
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:49,441
the subsidy program had expired and then
I him a job at a charity and his job was

336
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:54,721
to fold letters into three so that they 
can be put into envelopes.

337
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,750
Well,
that sounds easy except that he also had

338
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,751
a bit of a motor tremor and you know,
it took me about 30 hours to train him 

339
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:08,641
to fold up a piece of paper with 
sufficient precision so that it can be 

340
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:13,210
put in an envelope rapidly so that the 
envelope wasn't so mangled that it would

341
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:15,190
get stuck in the automatic sorting 
machine.

342
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,950
And another is high performance demands 
on him too.

343
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:22,951
He had to whip through those letters 
pretty quickly and then sometimes the 

344
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:27,751
letters would have a photograph 
appendant to them that was stapled on 

345
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,560
and they weren't always stapled on in 
the same place.

346
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:34,561
So then he had to calculate how to fold 
the paper over the photograph without 

347
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:38,380
bending the photograph in precise third 
so that would still fit in the envelope.

348
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,650
And then he had to separate the French 
letters from the English letters and 

349
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,370
associate them with the proper 
envelopes.

350
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,860
And like that level of complexity just 
did him in it.

351
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,580
Number one.
So

352
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,050
let me say two things.
One is I hope common sense and the other

353
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:58,470
is pretty provocative.
The common sense things.

354
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:03,471
We had to be very careful when we have 
these discussions not to devalue the 

355
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:08,760
human dignity of people who are in the 
upper end of the distribution.

356
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,230
And if there's one criticism that is 
fair is sometimes in these conversations

357
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:20,151
it sounds like we're devaluing people at
the lower end of the distribution and we

358
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,730
have to be very careful that we don't do
that.

359
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,150
A human life has dignity and Iq is not 
the most important thing that defines 

360
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,730
human beings even

361
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
associated with wisdom.
It's not necessarily associated with 

362
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,500
truth or with courage or with many 
virtues that that are how great your 

363
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,420
identity at all with being likable or on
the psychometric psychometric 

364
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,970
relationship between intelligence and 
conscientiousness is zero.

365
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,760
Right.
I think we have to make that point.

366
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,270
Yes,
I agree.

367
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,370
I agree.
I'm trying to make the point about how 

368
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,830
difficult it is for people who are on 
the low end of the cognitive spectrum to

369
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:08,831
survive in an increasingly complex,
cognitively sophisticated environment.

370
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,970
Right.
Your obs are just disappearing.

371
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,750
Yes,
absolutely.

372
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Now let's ask the question.
Is there anything that could be done 

373
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,990
about that?
Well,

374
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,710
Western society has tried very hard with
a number of environmental 

375
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,820
environmentally based interventions,
early childhood education.

376
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,150
By the way that you said the.
The literature in organizational 

377
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,041
psychology is very clear.
The literature is equally clear in 

378
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,460
educational psychology.

379
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,290
Oh yeah.
Well,

380
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:46,130
the relationship between Iq and learning
is more powerful than the relationship

381
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,890
between Iq job performance,
that that's right.

382
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,010
Which is kind of common sense or matches
are common sense,

383
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,370
but you know,
if you put a bunch of variables into a 

384
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,701
regression equation to predict academic 
achievement and you have all these 

385
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:05,201
school quality variables and teacher 
quality variables and cognitive 

386
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:09,431
variables of the students and what you 
find is that teacher variables and the 

387
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,541
quality of the school variables together
barely account for 10 percent.

388
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,530
I know,
I know.

389
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:19,940
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

390
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,190
Talk to the guy who ran it,
admissions at Harvard.

391
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:28,191
I taught at Harvard for a while.
His name was dean with law and he a 

392
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:28,770
really smart guy.
I really liked the and you know,

393
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:33,771
he was,
let's say he was on the right side of 

394
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,891
the human race and he was really trying 
to figure out how to run the admissions 

395
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,300
policy at Harvard so that it did the 
best for everyone concerned.

396
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:44,301
And he had run an interesting series of 
analysis that I don't believe he ever 

397
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:45,090
published.
And one of them was um,

398
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:50,930
well let's say you segregate the Harvard
population into the relatively low Iq 

399
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,160
kids.
So maybe they only have an Iq of 130,

400
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,800
you know,
and the relatively high Iq kids who were

401
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,750
pushing up towards two,
160.

402
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,450
So you are two competing hypotheses 
there.

403
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,480
One would be that the lower Iq kids come
to Harvard,

404
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:08,140
this remarkable environment,
and they and they,

405
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,690
and,
and they,

406
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,870
they thrive because of the high 
educational quality so well that they 

407
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,970
close the gap between them and the one 
60 kids.

408
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,220
And that's just completely,
completely wrong.

409
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,620
What happens is you put both those 
groups,

410
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:26,460
they're both very,
very highly selected,

411
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,610
but some,
you know,

412
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,420
in this sort of superman rage 
intellectually,

413
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,690
what happens is the gap just gets bigger
and bigger as they progress through 

414
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,440
university.
And it's a dreaded example of that,

415
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,460
uh,
matthew principle that the economists 

416
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,991
talk about,
which is no to those who have more will 

417
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:45,720
be given.
And from those who have nothing,

418
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,880
everything will be taken.
It's very,

419
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:52,881
very.
It's no wonder people disliked this 

420
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:52,881
research.
It's so,

421
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:56,130
it's so anti egalitarianism and it's 
essential and it's essential structure.

422
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,490
Well,
what I wanted to make a second point 

423
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,540
that I said would be provocative if you 
want to do something about this.

424
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,100
Uh,
you know,

425
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,970
we tried a bunch of interventions,
earnest,

426
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,060
well funded,
long term interventions don't seem to 

427
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,611
work,
but neuro science has been excluded from

428
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:20,981
discussions about what to do about this.
And I believe that neuroscience progress

429
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:26,711
in neuroscience research has the 
potential to really dramatically 

430
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,010
increase the g factor.
Well,

431
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,090
that's an optimistic statement.
So I'm sure looking forward to some 

432
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,211
support for that one.
It's optimistic and reversal and you 

433
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:42,470
know,
just as a thought experiment,

434
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,200
and I can tell you why I believe this is
possible.

435
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,520
What will first,
before I tell you the thought 

436
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,361
experiment,
the reason I'm optimistic is that it is 

437
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,460
because of the high heritability of the 
g factor.

438
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,380
That means your genes are involved.
Gene's work through biology,

439
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,600
even if the environment interacts with 
that.

440
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,320
But basically you have a neuro 
biological system.

441
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,100
It's complex,
but as you begin to understand it,

442
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,060
you can tweak it.
This is what all medicine is doing now.

443
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:20,061
They're trying to understand the neural 
biology slash genetic basis of our 

444
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:25,050
health and our diseases.
Why so they can fix it.

445
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,090
When you go to the doctor,
you're going because you were biology is

446
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:34,120
broken and you love your biology fixed.
Well,

447
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,130
let's think about the brain now.
No one conceptualized as low Iq as a 

448
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:44,541
disease and it's a little dangerous,
but to the extent to which low Iq has 

449
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:51,451
the genetic input or genetic influence,
that's the extent to which you might be 

450
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,300
able to to find out how that works,
how that,

451
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,410
what that system is,
and then figure out how to tweak that 

452
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,191
system to increase Iq.
It's not science fiction.

453
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,970
I mean that's.
That's a plausible sequence of events.

454
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,940
What the problem is,
it's a very complex sequence,

455
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,400
but I also think it's a finite set of 
problems,

456
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:20,700
not an infinite set of problems.
So the physicists,

457
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,630
physicists configure out what happened 
during the first nanoseconds of the big 

458
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:32,301
bang.
We can certainly figure out what the 

459
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:36,150
neural biology of intellect and how to 
tweak it.

460
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,350
So I think that's possible.
So now let's,

461
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,370
let's do a thought experiment.
Let's imagine there's an icu pill and I 

462
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,280
mean that metaphorically not really 
appealing.

463
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,330
You could take like putting a floor,
but like having fluoridated water just 

464
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:59,541
kind of raises the dental health of 
everybody would be nice if we had that 

465
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:04,220
for Iq,
but just to imagine what it would be 

466
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,041
like if we shifted the distribution of 
Iq 15 points into the high end so that 

467
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:15,171
now the average Iq,
I understand how it was computed and 

468
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,240
norming and everything,
but the point is that no one would have 

469
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,760
an Iq less than 100.
Right.

470
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,420
What would the world be like if everyone
could reason sufficiently to get a 

471
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,750
reasonable job?
Well,

472
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,400
that's a good question.
I mean,

473
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,450
the,
the,

474
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,610
the uh,
what would you call the perverse part of

475
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,260
me as funny?
I was just talking to one of my graduate

476
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:41,830
students.

477
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,790
We'd be looking at the determinants of 
male attractiveness by the personality 

478
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:51,090
of female viewers.
Okay.

479
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,530
Okay.
And so what we found is that there are 

480
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:56,890
some personality effects.
So I'm extroverted,

481
00:29:56,891 --> 00:30:01,891
enthusiastic women tend to rate men 
generally speaking as more attractive 

482
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:03,990
than introvert or introverted,
less enthusiastic women.

483
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,190
And um,
and so,

484
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,710
so there are some just straight 
personality effects,

485
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,710
but the biggest effect by far we found 
list the proclivity of,

486
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,250
of women in general to rape men as less 
attractive as the women's Iq increased.

487
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,910
And so the other thing that we don't 
know is what price we pay for,

488
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,290
for accelerated Iq from a,
from a broader perspective,

489
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:31,291
you know,
because I know that there is some 

490
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:31,291
evidence,
and you can tell me what you think about

491
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,981
this because I know that there's 
reasonable evidence that the average Iq 

492
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:39,790
of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is 
about 15 points higher than the standard

493
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:44,791
population,
which is kind of makes it a thought 

494
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:44,791
experiment.

495
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:44,791
It's an experiment,
real life experiment.

496
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,330
It's equivalent to the one that you laid
out.

497
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,630
But aszkenazy Jews also tend to suffer 
from a host of neurological diseases 

498
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,650
that seem to be associated with 
increased neuroplasticity.

499
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:59,030
And so to me it's often,
it's often hard to gain on one front 

500
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,100
without losing on another.
You know,

501
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:02,680
I mean that's the evolutionary conundrum
obviously,

502
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:05,710
but we call that the social justice 
theory.

503
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,870
If you started one thing,
you have to be bad and everything else 

504
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,040
that kind of balanced it out,
probably speaking,

505
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,860
you do pay a price for your,
for your exceptionalism,

506
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,500
you know that.
That's true because,

507
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,190
you know,
the,

508
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:23,191
uh,
the Julian Stanley studies or the math 

509
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:26,760
coaches,
kids essentially found not only were 

510
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,100
they smart,
but they were more mature than their age

511
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,140
peers.
Better looking,

512
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:31,420
they were color.
They were physically more fit.

513
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,570
I mean,
it was kind of the anti social.

514
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,540
I know that's terrible.
Well,

515
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:40,541
I mean it's just,
that also might be true because one of 

516
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,291
the things that can interfere with Iq is
poor health and poor nutritional quality

517
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:46,070
and all of that.
I mean,

518
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,510
it doesn't look like it's that easy to 
increase Iq,

519
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,590
but it looks like it's pretty easy to 
decrease it.

520
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,990
Yeah.
I,

521
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,240
you know,
I think that those,

522
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,570
those things have to be pretty extreme.
Yeah.

523
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,960
They have an effect and those effects 
may not be permanent.

524
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,961
Actually,
some studies of deprivation of people 

525
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:10,621
who suffer suffered deprivation during 
the second world war that suggests that 

526
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,620
Lowe's really severe,
uh,

527
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:17,160
deprivations didn't have lasting effects
on,

528
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,370
you know,
well,

529
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,400
people were pretty tough,
so I'm inclined to agree with that.

530
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,040
So,
so have you seen any animal experiment,

531
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,090
experimental work that you regard as 
compelling that shows something like the

532
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:31,100
transformation of,
of animal cognition into our,

533
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,500
into something that's,
it's,

534
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,590
it's,
it's higher order that you regard as 

535
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,840
compelling?
Not sure what you mean,

536
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:40,250
but there are certainly animal that

537
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,250
shows you extract the g factor from 
cognitive tests given to various 

538
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:45,740
animals.

539
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,950
Right?
So what I was wondering is has there 

540
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,441
been any evidence that you regard as 
credible showing at that could be that 

541
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:56,680
that say so called animal g factor 
extracted in the same.

542
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,690
We should tell our readers to.
The way you extract the g factor,

543
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,670
I'm going to say it very,
very rapidly,

544
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:06,671
is imagine you take a randomly set,
randomly selected set of 200 questions 

545
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,670
that require abstraction of one form or 
another to solve.

546
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,200
And then can

547
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,880
you give those 200 questions to 100 
people?

548
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,370
And you sum the scores and you rank 
order them.

549
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,760
You get something that's roughly 
equivalent there to a g factor.

550
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,810
It's roughly that.
So just say it a little bit differently.

551
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:34,730
Just forever is on the same page.
If you think of all the different mental

552
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:39,731
abilities and you devise a test for each
one of them and you gave this test where

553
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,230
a lot of people across the range of 
ability,

554
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,530
what you'll find is the scores on all 
those tests are positively correlated 

555
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,881
with each other,
suggesting that all tests have mental 

556
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:58,391
ability,
have something in common that's a great 

557
00:33:58,391 --> 00:33:59,210
name.
This g factor,

558
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,220
this general ability to reason and some 
individual tests have more Gillotti men,

559
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,690
other individual tests and tests of 
abstract reasoning tend to be highly 

560
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
guy.
He said to you,

561
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,930
repeat the following numbers back to me.

562
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,090
Three,
seven,

563
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,800
two,
one,

564
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,360
six,
five.

565
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,060
That's not a very highly loaded mental 
ability to be able to do that.

566
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,390
But if I gave you a streamline that and 
said,

567
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:36,410
repeat them to me backwards,
that becomes a g loaded ability because 

568
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,850
the transformation.
Well,

569
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,020
the other thing to say about that too is
that a positive relationship between 

570
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,660
that stems multiple assessments that you
described is actually quite high.

571
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:53,110
Right?
That's the thing is that that general 

572
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,320
factor not only exists across domains of
cognitive ability,

573
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:57,210
but it tends to account for a 
substantial amount of the,

574
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,080
have the ability in each of those 
domains,

575
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,480
right?
It's kind of like Regina is kind of like

576
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:06,380
a black hole for intelligence research 
and everything keeps falling into it.

577
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,370
So that's an interesting way to put it 
because now we have these,

578
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
uh,
junior association studies that are 

579
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,721
finding these bits of DNA that are 
related to either latent factor of 

580
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:27,161
intelligence,
which is the g factor or two what they 

581
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:31,001
call educational attainment variable.
So school attainment is so highly 

582
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:34,610
correlated with Iq and that is 
essentially the same thing.

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,180
So we're really moving.
When I was in graduate school,

584
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,420
the question was,
is there a genetic component to 

585
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:44,420
intelligence or not?

586
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,350
This kind of DNA analysis,
trying to find bits of DNA that are 

587
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:57,460
going to be related to what we call a 
intelligence or Iq testing or,

588
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,800
or,
or the g factor,

589
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:03,290
and they seem to exist.
There seems to be hundreds of them.

590
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,870
A tiny effect,
uh,

591
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,920
which will make the ultimate story are 
extremely complicated.

592
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:15,921
But as I said before,
I think it's a finite set of problems 

593
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:19,480
right at the end of that sequence of 
solving those problems.

594
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,850
I think there's a good chance we'll know
how to increase Iq and I think it's a 

595
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,900
good thing to be able to do that.
You know,

596
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:32,550
I had said publicly that more 
intelligence is better than less.

597
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,240
Sometimes I get criticized because that 
implies that people with less 

598
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,291
intelligence aren't as worthwhile.
That's why I want to be very careful 

599
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:46,401
that I don't believe that is more of the
accurate way of thinking about it and in

600
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,540
a narrow range of possibilities and 
opportunities.

601
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,400
That's right.
And in my view,

602
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:58,401
my political biases there for 
governments have a moral responsibility 

603
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,380
to help those people.
And,

604
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,120
and,
and,

605
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,630
uh,
a lot of government programs are,

606
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,790
aren't going to do it because your job 
training requires a certain level of uh,

607
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,040
and,
and so

608
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Iq clients,
they used to go to the government 

609
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,760
agencies that were designed to help 
people find employment and you know,

610
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,770
the typical response was,
well just go home and type up your CV 

611
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,820
and distributed.
It's like a,

612
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,040
you're just like,
can't use a computer.

613
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,770
I can't type,
I don't know what to CV is,

614
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
it's like it's,
it's a nonstarter and all three 

615
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,000
councils,
right?

616
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,080
That's right.
So in the United States there are 51 

617
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,690
million people with iqs under 85 and 
there were about 43 million people 

618
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:47,271
living in poverty.
Do you think those Venn diagrams 

619
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:47,420
intersect?
Well,

620
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,840
we should also be clear about that

621
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,710
because it is so politically suspect is 
that it's not like it's,

622
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,910
it's,
it's,

623
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,200
it's self evident that people who have 
less cognitive capability are likely to 

624
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:10,141
end up poor because there a serious 
complex problems in life that beset them

625
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,800
that they have a difficult time dealing 
with and they can't learn as quickly.

626
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,310
And so the relationship between poverty 
and intelligence is self evident if 

627
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,840
you're willing to think it through for 
any length of time.

628
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,270
It doesn't mean that everybody who's 
rich that is.

629
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,480
It doesn't mean that everyone who is 
rich is smart and it doesn't mean that 

630
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,480
everyone who is poor is stupid,
what it took to be blunt.

631
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,730
But what it mean is that if you're 
intelligent,

632
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,220
you're much more likely to become 
financially successful.

633
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:42,010
And I think it was the Hertenstein 
Herrnstein and Murray.

634
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:47,011
I think the calculations back in the 
bell curve that indicated that if you 

635
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:51,990
imagined that you could,
you were a fairy godmother and you have 

636
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,580
your newborn grandchild in front of you 
and you can grant them three standard 

637
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,991
deviations above the mean in terms of 
wealth at birth.

638
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:05,500
Or you can grant them three standard 
deviations above the mean in terms of Iq

639
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:10,501
at birth.
And then you wanted to determine which 

640
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:10,990
would work better for them by the time 
they were 40.

641
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:14,530
And the answer to that was quite clear 
is that Iq trump's wealth,

642
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:20,090
terrific.
If it's related to predict a positive 

643
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,090
future.

644
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,040
So that's why I'm so interested in the 
concept of increasing Iq or increasing 

645
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,610
the g factor,
not just the Iq score,

646
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:33,130
but really what Andre this reasoning 
ability.

647
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,460
So you know,
some people have tried to teach college 

648
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,101
students critical thinking.
I think that's a good thing if you can 

649
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,160
think critically so much the better.
Exactly.

650
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,390
You know,
and you know,

651
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,360
it may sound to your listeners,
I just want to take a moment out here.

652
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:54,361
It may sound to your listeners like here
are these two guys pontificating about 

653
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,230
what it's like to be smart,
not so smart.

654
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:01,390
I mean the point of this,
the point of neuroscience research,

655
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:06,391
all intelligence and what I hope to 
achieve by writing the book was to show 

656
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:09,940
that that the genetic aspects are not 
deterministic.

657
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,440
It's the opposite.
So probabilistic,

658
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,600
so the extent to which something like 
intelligence is genetic in my view,

659
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,910
is the extent to which we'll learn how 
to change it for the better.

660
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,970
Well that's definitely.
Yeah,

661
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:29,971
because people do tend to think about a 
biological factors as deterministic in 

662
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,720
that that's a mistake because they can 
be shifted.

663
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,130
So.
So

664
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,780
with regards to the animal study,
so you know,

665
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:38,260
you pointed out that you can,
you can come up with an Iq like estimate

666
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:43,261
for say a rat and have you seen anything
that indicates I don't care how it's 

667
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,691
done through training or or or 
neurochemically or or or by promoting 

668
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,480
brain function in different ways.
However you might do it.

669
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:57,481
That's actually indicated to you that 
there is a way of biologically enhancing

670
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:02,641
the general cognitive ability.
Even have an animal has anything 

671
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:06,510
credible just by breeding mice in a maze
faster than other mice.

672
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,760
Together you get mice.
It seemed to be able to learn how to run

673
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:17,761
a maze faster,
but that's work from the 19 eighties or 

674
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:21,610
review this in the book.
There are some interesting technologies 

675
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:28,861
that have been developed where you can 
turn parts of a rat brain on and off at 

676
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:36,470
will and see what happens.
This is not yet been applied as far as I

677
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:41,471
know to learning,
but interestingly there are human 

678
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,350
studies underway with things like that.

679
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,120
A trans cranial magnetic stimulation and
electrical

680
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,340
ways to low voltage ways to stimulate 
parts of the brain.

681
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And there are some interesting 
experiments now being done with humans 

682
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,130
to see if you can improve learning or 
reasoning ability benefactor,

683
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,470
I edit this journal,
the following colleges,

684
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:13,490
which is kind of a prime spot for 
intelligence researchers to publish on 

685
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:19,310
all aspects of intelligence and we're 
just starting to put together a special 

686
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:24,051
issue on human experiments to increase 
reasoning ability using these,

687
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,410
these,
uh,

688
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:30,620
techniques of stimulating the brain.
You've seen some positive things with 

689
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,601
regards to low level electrical 
stimulation because that's also been 

690
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:35,601
used.
It's more,

691
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,160
it's more anecdotal,
but there's a bit of research being used

692
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:39,870
to treat depression,
for example.

693
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,050
That's right.
And I do cover in the book the studies 

694
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,891
that were published up until the time I 
wrote the book and caution people that 

695
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,140
they hadn't been replicated yet.
Right,

696
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,170
right,
right.

697
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,240
But we're on the way.
I mean,

698
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,880
this is,
this is an evolving area that's going to

699
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,360
be very exciting.
I mean,

700
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:03,370
if students are listening to this 
podcast and we're thinking about 

701
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,410
neuroscience or psychology,

702
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,040
this kind of experiment is,
is,

703
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,070
is really a new phase of intelligence 
research where you can do experiments on

704
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:16,280
human beings that are completely 
ethical,

705
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,730
um,
and relatively non intrusive,

706
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,790
uh,
uh,

707
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,730
and this is really going to change 
everything because it will shift

708
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,180
intelligence research firm,
basically psychometric correlations past

709
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,250
what neuro imaging has done,
which,

710
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,990
which really moved it away from just 
cycle metrics and then correlating 

711
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,661
psychometric scores with measurable 
aspects of the brain like coast 

712
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:52,211
metabolic function or the amount of gray
matter or white matter or the number of 

713
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:53,390
white matter fibers.
I mean,

714
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:55,380
we're all these fabulous connections,
right?

715
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,710
Was this new thing I got in early on 
that things.

716
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,050
But that phase is now moving into this 
new phase of actually stimulating the 

717
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:11,171
brain to improve learning and memory and
reasoning and all the while doing it 

718
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,410
with neuroimaging.
Right?

719
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,410
See what happens and adding DNA to it.
I mean,

720
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,080
come on now.
This is a great time.

721
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,990
Great.
Entering the research in this area,

722
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,730
right?
Right.

723
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,580
Well,
there's some optimism on the rise.

724
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,880
I looked for a

725
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,030
because I've been very interested in 
improving human performance,

726
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:41,031
measuring it and improving it and so I 
looked and and doing that also in 

727
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:46,761
conjunction with businesses because I 
like things to have a practical end and 

728
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:50,300
you know,
I looked to find out what the research 

729
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,140
indicated with regards to improvement of
intelligence and mostly what I found was

730
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:57,141
not so much improvement as conservation 
is that if you exercise both aerobically

731
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:03,231
and and with weightlifting,
that that can help you maintain your 

732
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,560
fluid intelligence across for longer 
across your lifespan because it tends to

733
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:12,561
decline rather precipitously as you age,
which is one of the more dismal things 

734
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:16,611
that you also discovered with Iq 
research and starts to decline when 

735
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:20,091
you're in your early twenties and it's 
kind of a linear downhill all the way 

736
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:20,940
along.
But exercise really helps

737
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,780
it's preservation,
which is pretty important that my 

738
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,270
participation is a big deal man.
But enhancement would be good,

739
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:36,750
but you know this thing about an icu 
pill coming up with a way to manipulate 

740
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:42,781
your bio on the neurobiology of your 
brain regarding intellect.

741
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,110
If there's a breakthrough in this,
it will come either from Alzheimer's 

742
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:52,570
research,
more hormonal aging research,

743
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:57,571
trying to prevent the slow decline of 
your mental faculties as you age,

744
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:59,500
especially fluid intelligence,
right?

745
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,910
Uh,
or trying to reverse the ravages of 

746
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,761
Alzheimer's disease.
These are neurochemical problems right 

747
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,720
now.

748
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,380
Tightly,
tightly linked to,

749
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,450
oh,
this is another thing we can talk about 

750
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:18,450
because so,
um,

751
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,670
I know that there are certain biological
markers that Iq is loosely associated 

752
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:24,630
with,
so you know,

753
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,440
it's fragmented.
It predicts in a fragmentary matters.

754
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:31,740
So I know that even something as simple 
as simple reaction time,

755
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:36,240
how fast you can push a button when the 
light comes on is correlated with Iq,

756
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:38,580
with fluid intelligence at about point 
two,

757
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:42,270
and I'm having a bigger head is slightly
correlated,

758
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,300
especially when you correct for body 
size and so his brain mass and so is 

759
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,570
thickness of the Myelin Sheath.
So an individual neurons.

760
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,760
So there are these,
there's these micro markers of.

761
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,060
You might think about them as 
neurological integrity that seemed to 

762
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,761
predict Iq,
but you've been doing neuroimaging and 

763
00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:01,950
I'm not as up on that.
I haven't looked at that for a couple of

764
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,950
years,
so what have the neuro imagers found 

765
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,100
about brain structure and function in 
relationship to intelligence that you 

766
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,310
think is compelling and interesting?

767
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,980
Glad you asked this because as I was 
finishing the manuscript for the book,

768
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,330
literally

769
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,110
after I turned it in,
I had to ask for it back because there 

770
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,880
was this very interesting study 
published by a group at Yale that has,

771
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,170
that used a fairly sophisticated way to 
look at white matter connection,

772
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,440
functional structural white matter 
connections and functional connections 

773
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,300
in the brain.
Um,

774
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,390
and determining how one brain area is 
functionally or structuring structurally

775
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,800
related to all other brain areas.
And you can put up a map of,

776
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,410
of a person's brain that shows from 
brain imaging,

777
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:09,360
from MRI technology,
how their brain is interconnected.

778
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,260
This paper said these inner connections 
are so reliable within a person that 

779
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:21,990
they're like fingerprints and not only 
that,

780
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,180
but the fingerprints can predict Iq,

781
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,180
the density of connections,
density of interconnections or something

782
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:35,181
like that.
Or is there something more specific 

783
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:35,181
going on?

784
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:36,960
It can be the density of connections 
structurally.

785
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:41,100
How much white matter connects this area
to that area,

786
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,700
you know,
and there are certain brain areas where 

787
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,921
you have a lot of white matter coming in
and a lot of white matter going out to 

788
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:52,551
other parts of the brain that are called
hubs and there are nodes that have 

789
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:58,191
lesser connections and so it makes it 
certainly makes sense that being able to

790
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:05,030
make measurements of brain activity 
would be related to things like 

791
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,220
intelligence.
And

792
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,580
do you remember what some of the major 
hubs we're like,

793
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,940
are they identifiable as also as 
neuroanatomical areas with specific?

794
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:14,020
Yeah.

795
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,040
Countries definitely neuro,
no anatomical areas and they're white,

796
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:26,760
you might expect,
but they.

797
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,730
What was exciting to me is they mapped 
on to a,

798
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:35,731
a,
a model of brain intelligence 

799
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:39,201
relationships that I had developed with 
my colleague rex young and published in 

800
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:44,871
2007 and it was called the parietal 
frontal integration theory of 

801
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,060
intelligence.
And the idea is that the connections 

802
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,511
between the parietal lobe,
which is here and the frontal area,

803
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,750
are the key connections for 
intelligence.

804
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,260
Tell us,
tell us why you derive that particular 

805
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,260
theory.
Because you know,

806
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,331
people have suggested say alternatively 
that the seat of higher order 

807
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:14,861
intelligence is basically let's say the 
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or 

808
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,300
something like that.
So why specifically the connection,

809
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,170
the connection patterns between frontal 
and Parietal area was.

810
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,340
Well,
this article in 2007 was a review 

811
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,141
article where we took every single 
imaging study we could find that 

812
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:34,940
included a measure of intelligence and 
there were 37 such studies at the time,

813
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,630
including some I had done as early as 
1988 and others had done with much 

814
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:45,191
larger samples and we just kinda 
qualitatively analyze the results to see

815
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
what brain areas came up in common 
across these studies using different 

816
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,710
measures,
different imaging techniques.

817
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,100
And we found that there was not an that 
not all brain areas were equally 

818
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:05,771
distributed.
They tended to be concentrated in the 

819
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,510
front and the parietal lobe,
but also we found areas in the occipital

820
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:12,650
lobe and the temporal lobe that were 
also related to intelligence.

821
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,980
And so we developed this model that we 
talked about how information would be 

822
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:23,021
processed and how information would flow
around this set of.

823
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:28,010
I think there were 18 areas all 
hypothesize,

824
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,530
scored high on intelligence tests would 
have some combination of these areas.

825
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,060
You didn't need all of them kind of 
working together,

826
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,820
but some people would have this 
combination,

827
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:45,821
some people will have that combination 
and if you can make measurements of 

828
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:50,850
about the way information was flowing 
around these areas with technology like 

829
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:56,471
there may be ground which shows changes 
in the brain millisecond by millisecond 

830
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,520
that you might be able to actually 
estimate Iq from Brighton images.

831
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Two Thousand and seven people were 
trying to do this with multiple 

832
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,300
regression equations that never really 
replicated.

833
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:16,301
Independent replications didn't go very 
far because the sample sizes were 

834
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,800
relatively small and you have enormous 
individual differences,

835
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:24,430
but these newer techniques,
these mathematical techniques of 

836
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:28,571
calculating brain conductivity really 
seem to have advanced this whole thing.

837
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:34,151
Dramatic.
Was there a map between the nodes that 

838
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,781
were identified in this more recent 
research in the areas that you guys had 

839
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:38,450
identified with your overarching 
analysis?

840
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,490
Yes,
to to the way,

841
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,540
and I looked at the data.
It seemed like there was considerable 

842
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,711
overlap and some of the authors who we 
did not know personally when they wrote 

843
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:56,021
their papers,
noted that the findings were consistent 

844
00:52:56,021 --> 00:52:59,060
with our model.
Any hemispheric differences?

845
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,430
We are,
yes,

846
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,490
there were.
There were more on the left than on the 

847
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,681
right,
but there were also areas on the right 

848
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:11,830
as well and these areas tend to be areas
that are also related to a language and 

849
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:21,581
memory and attention.
More fundamental cognitive processes of 

850
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:28,470
language,
memory and attention seem to be the the,

851
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,020
the architecture on which intelligence

852
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:37,150
you.
Here's a question that I haven't been 

853
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,281
able to figure out because I've looked 
at the attention literature lot and the 

854
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:43,361
more I look at the attention literature,
the more I find it difficult to 

855
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:44,150
distinguish it from the intelligence 
literature.

856
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:49,151
I mean attention and intelligence seemed
to be different things and we certainly 

857
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:50,540
use the words in common parlance as 
different,

858
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:55,541
but I haven't really been able to like 
imagine you wanted to establish a 

859
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:59,951
battery of attention related tests that 
were independent of Ge loaded a 

860
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:06,130
cognitive abilities.
I haven't seen anybody manage that and 

861
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:06,530
so do.
Do you,

862
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:10,460
what do you think the difference is 
between the capacity to pay attention,

863
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,760
which also seems to be associated with 
conscientiousness by the way,

864
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:18,761
which isn't associated with Iq,
but I mean what's the relationship 

865
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:22,931
between intention,
attention and intelligence as far as 

866
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:22,931
you're concerned,

867
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:25,200
so studies have been done where they 
take cognitive variables,

868
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,370
elemental cognitive tasks is what they 
call them,

869
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,150
the real basic things that cognitive 
psychologists like to study,

870
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,910
like the study reasoning,
and they all studied wanting in memory,

871
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,760
but they don't want to address why some 
people learn faster than other people or

872
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:46,410
why some people can remember more than 
other people.

873
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,730
That's a cognitive psychologist study.
They studied what's common to everybody,

874
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,180
but if you look at these elemental 
cognitive tasks so you can extracted a 

875
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,201
Jew factor of cognition,
which is highly correlated with a 

876
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:04,570
psychometric sure abilities more than 
attention.

877
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,680
Memory aspects of memory are more 
correlated to the gene factor.

878
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,210
A processing speed is correlated.
Sure,

879
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,600
and the tension is also correlated.
So I kind of have this idea from being a

880
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:27,471
parent watching my kids grow up,
that people differ in their baseline of 

881
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,010
attention when they're not specifically 
paying attention.

882
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,230
This might be called consciousness.
So you know,

883
00:55:38,231 --> 00:55:43,231
you have two kids walking through a 
museum for an hour and you come out and 

884
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:44,340
you're saying the kid one.
So why did you see?

885
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,720
And you get a whole long thing and yes,
the other kid.

886
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:48,900
Well,
why did you see there?

887
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:53,340
And you'd get a much was rich 
explanation.

888
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:58,510
Yeah.
Of what I've always thought about that 

889
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,360
as a difference in resolution of worlds.
Well,

890
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:01,620
yeah,
call what you will,

891
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:04,170
but you know,
there are these differences.

892
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,420
And uh,
you know,

893
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,430
we have,
we've actually studied consciousness 

894
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,430
with brain imaging,
uh,

895
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,020
with my friend Mike outlier who's an 
anesthesiologist.

896
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:18,021
We did the first imaging studies where 
we brought normal volunteers in and Mike

897
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:25,761
gave them a anesthetic drugs to knock 
them out completely.

898
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:30,640
They underwent brain imaging and we had 
different levels of anesthesia.

899
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:35,641
We were trying to see what part of the 
brain is the last part of the brain to 

900
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:36,830
turn off when you lose consciousness.
And they're than

901
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,120
did you find anything that you can make 
sense out of from that?

902
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:45,121
Because of course,
that's obviously an extraordinarily 

903
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:47,521
interesting question.
Immediately the collapse of these 

904
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:47,521
networks is

905
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,660
just the real expert on the whole series
of papers that the mechanism of 

906
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:56,860
consciousness is still one of the Great 
Nobel prize winning.

907
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:57,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

908
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:02,490
Well,
that's my interpretation of literature 

909
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:02,490
too.
It's like,

910
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:02,490
it,
it,

911
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:07,080
it's,
it's such a mystery that it seems 

912
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:07,080
uncrackable in some sense.

913
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,130
Well,
what was good about the imaging stuff?

914
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,840
You could study this experimentally.
Yep.

915
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,720
You know,
you could,

916
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,050
you could put people into different 
levels of consciousness and burning them

917
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:21,460
out at will and seeing what,
how the brain reacted.

918
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:24,700
So the Thalamus seems to be an 
important.

919
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:27,010
A lot of people.
And I found those connections,

920
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,480
uh,
and each anesthetic,

921
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,800
there are categories of anesthetics and 
they weren't.

922
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,740
They have different mechanisms of action
in the brain,

923
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,010
yet they all produce the same a 
consequence when you purchased this,

924
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:46,830
that's a very interesting thing to.
So what does it,

925
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,740
cortical thalamic loops will mean.
There's a guy named,

926
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,680
what's his name?
God,

927
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:55,490
it's close to that.
I'm afraid to.

928
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,650
I haven't gotten it right.
He suggests that I'm one of the,

929
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:04,770
one of the consequences of psychedelic 
drugs is to decrease the gating of the 

930
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:11,130
thalamic cortical circuitry and,
and that that's one of the mechanisms 

931
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,160
whereby that expanded at least sense of 
consciousness emerges as a constantly,

932
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:15,660
you know,
as a,

933
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,300
as a consequence of experimentation with
this,

934
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,250
with the psychedelic end of the 
pharmaceutical universe.

935
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:26,410
Yeah.
We have a section where I talk about 

936
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,540
consciousness studies and try to relate 
the concept that if you can turn 

937
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,841
consciousness off,
you should be able to turn it on.

938
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,590
No anesthesiologists do this at will eop
even though they don't understand what 

939
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,650
they're doing.
Right,

940
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:44,820
right.
You know,

941
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,360
uh,
they,

942
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:52,390
they can't tell you why it works.
But then can you use if,

943
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:58,070
if anesthetic drugs had to dissociate 
the brain and creativity seems to be 

944
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:07,221
related to a dissociation of the frontal
lobes can lower doses,

945
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:14,210
very,
very low doses of anesthetic drugs 

946
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:18,160
caused just enough dis inhibition to 
increase your creativity.

947
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,370
And I don't think this experiment has 
ever been done.

948
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:29,460
No.
You see something similar in that 

949
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,970
sometimes reported with people who've 
developed frontal temporal dementia at.

950
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:30,900
Exactly.
Right.

951
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,740
And that's,
that's,

952
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,220
that's a very strange phenomenon where 
as your brain deteriorates,

953
00:59:36,221 --> 00:59:41,221
your creativity increases because so 
much of brain function seems to be 

954
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:41,221
inhibitory.

955
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:46,080
So I don't know if a comparable disease 
that produces increases in intelligence,

956
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,080
right?
No,

957
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:49,340
no,
I've never heard of that.

958
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,200
Oh yeah.
The other thing that's been,

959
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,910
so,
you tell me what you think about this.

960
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:57,911
I mean,
I was curious for awhile about these 

961
00:59:57,911 --> 01:00:01,571
companies like lumosity,
because when we developed our original 

962
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:03,080
prefrontal tap tasks,
they weren't tests.

963
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:04,940
They were,
they kind of had a game like element,

964
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:06,530
you know,
and we kind of thought,

965
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:09,710
well maybe if you have people practice 
doing them,

966
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:15,200
um,
they would obviously get better at the 

967
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,200
specific task because that is what 
people do.

968
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,900
But then if you had people practice a 
whole bunch of them,

969
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,760
maybe they would get better at the 
whole,

970
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:23,510
at the entirety of the tasks in a way 
that would generalize to other,

971
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,990
to other measures like the Raven's 
progressive matrices,

972
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:29,180
which is a good measure of fluid 
intelligence.

973
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:34,181
But that never works,
and of course the lumosity people 

974
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:37,430
claimed that they were able to produce 
enhancement in general intelligence,

975
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:39,740
but by all appearances,
appearances,

976
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,140
that's been a.
that's been a dismal failure as well.

977
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:43,280
It's,
it's,

978
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,840
it's very strange in some sense that 
that general factor doesn't seem to be 

979
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,560
something that you can actually improve 
by practice.

980
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,530
Not What the hell why?
Why can't.

981
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,900
I just don't get that.
It doesn't make sense.

982
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:57,070
But

983
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,400
here's something you don't know about 
me.

984
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:03,630
I'll bet.
But I am in the Guinness Book of Records

985
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:08,630
to Gamers addition because of my study,
my brain imaging study of Tetris and I 

986
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,500
did a brain imaging study of Tetris.
I thought it was published in 1992.

987
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:20,230
I really want to do a study of warning.
I wanted to see what happened in the 

988
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,030
brain before and after your one 
something.

989
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,960
And back in 1991 when I was doing this,
nobody had personal computers.

990
01:01:27,001 --> 01:01:32,001
Nobody had ever heard of tattooist 
computer games were not what they are 

991
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:37,170
today.
And I went to the egghead software store

992
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:42,171
when they had software stores that had 
just opened and I was talking to the 

993
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:45,651
guys there about I needed something 
where I could study before and after 

994
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:48,210
they learned something relatively 
simple.

995
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,980
Yep.
They showed me this game,

996
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:51,240
tetris.
It had just come in.

997
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,410
They just had opened the box.

998
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,780
They put it up on the computer there and
I thought,

999
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,100
boy,
this is really perfect.

1000
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:59,220
It's simple to learn,
but there's an enormous learning curve.

1001
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,530
And we.
We brought in a college students,

1002
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:07,020
a small number of college students,
and we showed them how to play tetris.

1003
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:12,950
They practice for a few minutes.
We injected the radioactive glucose for 

1004
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:17,841
positron emission tomography and we did 
a pet scan studies of them that very 

1005
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:23,360
first day played tetris for 32 minutes.
They've been practiced everyday.

1006
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,610
They had to come to my office because 
nobody had a pc at home.

1007
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,570
They came to my office five days a week 
for about four weeks.

1008
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,540
They practice until they got so good at 
Tetris.

1009
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,980
Game is moving faster.
It's amazing how good people can get it.

1010
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,980
You couldn't even believe a human being 
could do.

1011
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,320
I've watched people do that sort of 
thing.

1012
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:48,321
It's just absolutely unbelievable how 
good they can get out of it and when 

1013
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:51,771
they got really good,
we scanned on the second time and we 

1014
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:54,120
found that even though the game was 
faster,

1015
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:56,670
harder,
when they had learned how to do it,

1016
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,950
they used less glucose metabolic rate.

1017
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,540
Okay,
so now I knew that research.

1018
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,770
I read that research.
Now.

1019
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,000
What do you think about?
The problem is,

1020
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:13,001
I can't remember where this research 
came from because I also read at 

1021
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:16,091
approximately the same time studies that
appeared to claim and I think this was 

1022
01:03:16,091 --> 01:03:21,011
reviewed by Al Conan Goldberg and his 
book on a on hemispheric specialization 

1023
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:23,750
for regionalization and novelty 
respectively.

1024
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:29,050
That as you,
when you first start to learn something 

1025
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,050
novel,
and I think this was demonstrated,

1026
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:32,030
for example,
in people who are listening,

1027
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,120
they were Danish native speakers who are
listening to Danish in reverse and they 

1028
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,950
use very large part portions of their 
brain when they were listening to Davish

1029
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:44,951
and reverse,
but if they were listening to Danish 

1030
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:47,560
property spoken,
they use very small specified parts of 

1031
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,160
the brain that were located in the 
ladder or enough in the back part of the

1032
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:55,180
left hemisphere and there was another 
group of researchers who were 

1033
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,721
demonstrating that as you learned,
the degree of activation decreased and 

1034
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:03,641
it shifted from the right to the left 
and it shifted from the front to the 

1035
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:06,671
back and it got smaller and smaller.
And is that associated with that 

1036
01:04:06,671 --> 01:04:08,510
decreased glucose utilization?
Is that the same phenomena?

1037
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,040
I think it is

1038
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:13,450
to show it.
We had done one,

1039
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:18,620
one imaging study before this tetris 
study where we'll just correlated a 

1040
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,500
glucose metabolic rate with scores on a 
test of abstract reasoning.

1041
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:29,431
The hygiene load tests.
They had taken the test during the 

1042
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:33,751
imaging,
so we'll see what brain areas we're 

1043
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:33,970
involved and we did find some brain 
areas,

1044
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:38,971
but the really interesting,
surprising thing was the correlation 

1045
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:42,700
between the scores and glucose metabolic
rate was always negative other than they

1046
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:45,610
did on the test,
the lower their glucose metabolic rate,

1047
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,880
and that was the first thing we had 
about this idea of brain efficiency that

1048
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:56,610
there's been a lot of research on that 
turns out to be a complicated thing 

1049
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,120
because nothing about the brain is 
simple,

1050
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,540
right?
But it

1051
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,540
does seem to make perfect sense that 
expert skill is associated with doing 

1052
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,890
more with less.
It makes sense now,

1053
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,830
but I tell you,
nobody predicted it.

1054
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,610
And look,
I understand.

1055
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:15,611
All right,
that's research that research stood out 

1056
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:15,611
for me in a very,
very,

1057
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:15,611
uh,
you know,

1058
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,180
in a,
in a very striking manner.

1059
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,440
So this thing about that you raised 
about practicing on different kinds of 

1060
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:28,801
tests because of the attractive things 
about tetricks is visual spacial 

1061
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:34,170
planning ahead to pension.
There are a lot of elemental cognitive 

1062
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,010
tasks necessary.
You know,

1063
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:43,011
it was fine motor control,
really necessary to do well on tech 

1064
01:05:43,011 --> 01:05:47,601
person to run it really well.
And so the Tetris company found my 

1065
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:53,161
research some years later and asked if 
I'd be willing to try to replicate it 

1066
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:57,340
with more modern imaging,
which of course I was willing to do.

1067
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,110
So they funded this and um,
we found now instead of pet scanning,

1068
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:07,270
we use functional Mri and structural Mri
both.

1069
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:12,190
And we did find,
we found with the pet scanning for areas

1070
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
where after a teenage girls with very 
limited gaming experience Tetris,

1071
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:25,020
their brain activity decreased.
But we also found from the structural 

1072
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:33,301
MRI that there were increases in gray 
matter.

1073
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,650
And the really interesting thing is the 
areas where there were increases in gray

1074
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:43,651
matter did not overlap at all with the 
areas that functionally decreased.

1075
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:50,430
It would have been a terrific story that
strange things are always more 

1076
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,840
complicated than you hope them to be.
Not only that,

1077
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:57,370
but I can tell you that every time I did
a brain imaging study,

1078
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,620
we always found the exact opposite of 
what we expected.

1079
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,160
That,

1080
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,570
that sounds to me like,
you know,

1081
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,020
you might actually be,
be,

1082
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,990
uh,
be operating as a real scientist.

1083
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:15,390
What does,
I mean things are so damn complicated 

1084
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:15,390
that it's really difficult to guess,
right?

1085
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:15,390
To begin with.

1086
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:21,540
Well,
I went to one of my three laws based on 

1087
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,980
one.
Number one is no story about the brain 

1088
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:24,980
is simple.
One,

1089
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,951
number two is no one study is definitive
and law number three is it takes a long 

1090
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:33,991
time to sort out all the various studies
to see what's consistent and what 

1091
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:36,340
establishes a reliable way to have 
evidence.

1092
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,720
Let me put you on a different track 
momentarily and maybe this won't work 

1093
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:42,720
but,
but you know,

1094
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,030
I'm always curious about,
uh,

1095
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,980
let's say the practical implications of 
scientific research both at a personal 

1096
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,460
level,
familiar level,

1097
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:53,080
social level,
all of those things.

1098
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:54,430
You know.
So I mean,

1099
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:59,431
one of the things that I'm planning to 
do in the near future is to launch a 

1100
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,461
website where that will enable people to
assess themselves with what we've 

1101
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:06,181
developed a scale called the big five 
aspect scale that breaks the big five 

1102
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:07,420
down into 10 aspects,
each of which,

1103
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,350
which provides some additional high 
resolution and useful descriptions of 

1104
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:17,761
personality.
So you'll be able to go there and find 

1105
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,681
out what your personality is like.
You'd be able to compare yourself to 

1106
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:19,681
other people who,
you know,

1107
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:21,830
to find out where your similarities and 
differences are.

1108
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:27,100
But one of the things we've been 
thinking about doing as well is putting 

1109
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,930
up on the same side or real Iq tests 
nicely validated,

1110
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:35,020
probably focusing on fluid intelligence 
because it's a little bit less 

1111
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,280
linguistically complex to do so,
but maybe measuring verbal intelligence 

1112
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:44,170
and then showing people the strata of 
occupations in which they're likely to 

1113
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:46,040
find maximal success.

1114
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,560
Because you know from,
for me,

1115
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,860
given that I know that,
that people vary in their cognitive 

1116
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,891
abilities tremendously and that that's 
actually an important determinant of 

1117
01:08:56,891 --> 01:08:56,891
their life outcome.
It seems to me.

1118
01:08:56,891 --> 01:09:00,250
So let's say someone tests out in an Iq 
of around 150,

1119
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,330
and so you can say,
look,

1120
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:03,860
you know,
you're pretty damn smart.

1121
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:08,861
You're,
you're up above 85 percent of the 

1122
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:08,861
general population.
You could,

1123
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:12,020
you could probably do a pretty damn good
job as an undergraduate in university if

1124
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:13,850
you're also disciplined,
right?

1125
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:15,740
If you were conscientious,
he hit the books harder.

1126
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:21,130
You're gonna,
you're gonna come out in the top core 

1127
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,711
tile of your class,
assuming that you're not at a 

1128
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:25,190
spectacularly successful,
a spectacularly selective university,

1129
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,260
but you're going to have a much more 
difficult time as a master's student and

1130
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:35,261
phd level stuff is going to be.
You're going to be pushing your luck to 

1131
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:35,261
really master that.

1132
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:36,950
But you know,
you could be,

1133
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,020
here's a,
here's a domain of,

1134
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,920
of,
of,

1135
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:41,060
of,
uh,

1136
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,180
what would you call it?
Industrial organizational activity where

1137
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,030
you could really be in the top 10 
percentile.

1138
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:47,840
You know,
it's like.

1139
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:53,110
So if you have an Iq of 115,
like you might make one bang up plumber 

1140
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,150
and you could have a spectacularly 
successful career as a plumber.

1141
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,400
And maybe as a manager of other plumbers
and all of that and you know,

1142
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:04,401
and I,
I actually happened to be a real 

1143
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,521
efficacy and of the trade,
so I certainly don't think of that as 

1144
01:10:06,521 --> 01:10:09,371
something that's a,
that's a low quality or low status 

1145
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:09,890
occupation in the least.
But we would,

1146
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,370
we would like to tell people,
okay heres,

1147
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,340
heres,
here's a,

1148
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:21,430
here's an intellectual domain that's 
probably too high for you to be 

1149
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:25,960
successful without working insane hours 
to,

1150
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,000
to,
to,

1151
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,320
to close the gap because you can do that
within st work up to some,

1152
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,550
some limited degree.

1153
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,880
But it seems to me that the logical 
thing to do at least in part is to give 

1154
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,601
people a sense of what their advantages 
and limitations are and then say to 

1155
01:10:40,601 --> 01:10:40,601
them,
okay,

1156
01:10:40,601 --> 01:10:45,431
well given that here's a place that you 
could go where you could be optimally 

1157
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:47,300
successful.
And so,

1158
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,360
you know,
that's Kinda my take from a policy 

1159
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:52,360
perspective let's say.
But like what have you thought about,

1160
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,221
you know,
the massive diversity and intellectual 

1161
01:10:57,221 --> 01:11:00,251
ability.
You mean what are the implications from 

1162
01:11:00,251 --> 01:11:02,501
a policy perspective as far as you're 
concerned or location or guidance is 

1163
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:06,731
clearly one.
I actually did some consulting and some 

1164
01:11:06,731 --> 01:11:09,350
research for a nonprofit group called 
the Johnson O'connor Foundation,

1165
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:14,010
which is a vocational testing.
We're not that big on ge,

1166
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,350
but they have their own battery of 
tests.

1167
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:20,660
They bring someone in and do a full day 
of,

1168
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,700
of cognitive tests.
And from that they give some advice 

1169
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,051
about what kinds of professions match 
their cognitive strengths and 

1170
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:33,160
weaknesses.
And I actually did some brain imaging,

1171
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,470
uh,
on their tests and it was very,

1172
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,140
very interesting stuff.

1173
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:42,640
Um,
because it's hard to do the 

1174
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,031
psychometrics properly with regards to 
vocational guidance because we don't 

1175
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:52,221
really know.
We don't have a good handle on how to 

1176
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:52,380
classify jobs into their various 
subtypes.

1177
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:54,690
Like John Holland has done some good 
work doing that,

1178
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:59,691
but,
but there's so many jobs and it's hard 

1179
01:11:59,691 --> 01:11:59,691
to figure out,
well,

1180
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,470
what makes two jobs the same or similar,
you know?

1181
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,620
No,
I was at Hopkins when Holland was there 

1182
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,260
in some of my friends were graduate 
students work for him.

1183
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,160
And I learned all about that vocational 
testing.

1184
01:12:10,161 --> 01:12:12,180
That's very powerful.
And as you know,

1185
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,280
it's,
that's more of his,

1186
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:18,150
his scales have kind of morphed into 
more personality.

1187
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,850
White dementia.
Yeah,

1188
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,270
that's it.
That's exactly the nexus that we want to

1189
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:24,140
play out.
It's like,

1190
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,210
okay,
because there is a reason.

1191
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:31,010
I know people have been mapping Holland 
Holland job categories onto the big five

1192
01:12:31,011 --> 01:12:33,020
and we have a fair bit of success,
you know,

1193
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,860
and we're hoping that the 
differentiation down to the 10 levels of

1194
01:12:36,861 --> 01:12:39,050
personality will provide even more 
precision.

1195
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,200
But,
but with more general policy let.

1196
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:42,980
Okay.
So far,

1197
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,620
so reasonable vocational counseling.

1198
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,380
That's a good idea.
When does it start?

1199
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,010
Does it start in junior high?
Like do you do

1200
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,150
the Europeans do and start to attract 
people into trades and,

1201
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:57,750
and,
and higher education at that early age.

1202
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,440
European seemed to have had great 
success with that.

1203
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:03,760
So it's certainly Germans in particular.
Yeah.

1204
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,830
So reasonable to look at.
But the problem in the United States,

1205
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:12,831
there were so many problems with the way
we conceptualize education and the whole

1206
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:19,200
idea of tracking.
I don't know how it is in Canada,

1207
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:24,201
but in the United States,
this idea of tracking has a very 

1208
01:13:24,201 --> 01:13:24,330
negative valance.
Do it,

1209
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,330
you know,
segregating the smart kids into one,

1210
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:32,690
one a set of classes and the less smart 
kids in dollars and then there's 

1211
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:37,950
remedial education and,
and there's been a tendency,

1212
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:42,951
a strong tendency in the United States 
to feel that kids learn from each other.

1213
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:46,980
So you don't want homogeneous groups 
based on learning ability.

1214
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,790
Your want.
Yeah.

1215
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:54,590
It's so funny because people say that 
with regards to two,

1216
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,950
let's say academic achievement,
but they play exactly the opposite.

1217
01:13:57,951 --> 01:14:01,640
Stumped when it comes to such things as 
has childhood sports,

1218
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,280
you know,
so if you look at football for example,

1219
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:05,180
it's like,
well hey,

1220
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:10,181
let's segregate like abilities.
Like you don't have the people who 

1221
01:14:10,181 --> 01:14:10,700
stumble around on the field,
dropping the ball all the time,

1222
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:15,701
playing the top end quarterbacks and 
nobody thinks there's a problem with 

1223
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:15,701
that.
They don't say,

1224
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:20,371
well,
everyone learns from everyone else in 

1225
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:22,321
that situation.
So to me it speaks more of a refusal to 

1226
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:27,420
admit to the stark reality that there 
are massive cognitive differences 

1227
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,051
between people.
And to try to actually start to address 

1228
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,680
that with some degree of seriousness and
the serious should be something like,

1229
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,780
okay,
well let's look at the bottom 15 percent

1230
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:37,120
of the population cognitively speaking.

1231
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:40,540
It's like,
what the hell can we do for those people

1232
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:45,541
that's going to be useful and you know,
like the guy that I was telling you 

1233
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:48,841
about,
I was trying to think of some way that 

1234
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:51,151
he could find a respectable and 
productive and relatively stable 

1235
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:55,390
position in society that would be 
useful.

1236
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,280
And I thought there was a couple of 
things he could do.

1237
01:14:57,281 --> 01:15:01,630
Like one of the things he could've done,
I think he could have been encouraged,

1238
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,400
let's say,
to,

1239
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:09,210
to collect trash in the downtown areas.
Like he could have been assigned a city 

1240
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:11,440
block and it could have been said to 
him,

1241
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:14,560
look,
your job is to keep this damn city block

1242
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,170
clean.
Here's the bag,

1243
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,790
here's the stick.
You get up in the morning,

1244
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,430
you go do this.
It's like it makes everybody's life more

1245
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:23,890
pleasant.
It's a valuable contribution.

1246
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,060
It's something you could do with a 
certain degree of pride and it.

1247
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,930
And there's a socially valuable end of 
it.

1248
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:33,670
Now what happens in Toronto is that 
people drive around these vacuum cleaner

1249
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:38,671
machines on sidewalks and pick up the 
scrap paper and all of that.

1250
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:42,400
That actually turns out to be a very 
cognitively demanding job because,

1251
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,590
well,
you have to pay careful attention.

1252
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,440
You can't run over people.
You have to have decent social skills.

1253
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:49,120
And you know,
it's complicated.

1254
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:54,121
But it might be nice to see.
But we were not mature enough to have a 

1255
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:56,410
discussion like this as a society we 
might want to say is like,

1256
01:15:56,411 --> 01:16:01,411
okay,
well there's a group of people who 

1257
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:01,411
aren't going to be able to compete in 
the,

1258
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:05,890
in the cognitive workplace.
They're not going to do it.

1259
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:11,370
And there's actually lots of them and 
we're not going to say they're lazy and 

1260
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:11,380
we're not going to say they're not 
looking for work.

1261
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:12,760
We're not going to say any of that.
We're going to say,

1262
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:17,761
look,
we need to find occupations that have 

1263
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:23,140
public utility that aren't just make 
work projects that people have.

1264
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:28,141
That level of abstract capacity could 
actually perform.

1265
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,390
But I don't think we have the maturity 
to have that conversation.

1266
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:36,950
We don't have the economics.
And so I would go even a little to the 

1267
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,180
left of you and I would say there's 
nothing wrong with make work programs,

1268
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,200
you know,
to,

1269
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,340
to allow people.
I mean,

1270
01:16:43,341 --> 01:16:47,530
you have to work with dignity.
So you heard that option,

1271
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:52,510
but you also have this interesting 
experiment being proposed of the minimum

1272
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:53,500
annual income.

1273
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,760
Yeah.
Well that worries me because see if 

1274
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:58,920
there's a couple of things about that 
when it concerns me because,

1275
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:04,430
you know,
so we're having a conversation here 

1276
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:04,430
where we're taking,
um,

1277
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,400
differences in Iq seriously.
But the problem with a guaranteed annual

1278
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:11,630
income issue,
I think one of the problems,

1279
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,540
and I'm not denying its potential 
utility,

1280
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,350
it's something that I think that would 
have to be experimentally determined and

1281
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:21,680
all of that.
And maybe it could replace a plethora of

1282
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:24,470
less efficient social welfare programs.
But,

1283
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:29,570
you know,
it isn't obvious to me.

1284
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:35,110
It's obvious to me that there's a 
substantial proportion of the 

1285
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,961
population.
And I would say it's probably five 

1286
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:39,911
percent that would destroy themselves 
instantly if you gave them a guaranteed 

1287
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,280
annual income and they would do it 
because they're very low in 

1288
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:45,280
conscientiousness,
for example,

1289
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,710
and very impulsive and like I've worked 
with many guys,

1290
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:54,010
often x cocaine addicts who were often 
not all that high on the end of the 

1291
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:54,800
cognitive distribution,
but very,

1292
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:57,560
very low in conscientiousness,
high and impulsivity.

1293
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,160
And those guys were absolutely fine as 
long as they were flat broke.

1294
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,310
But man,
I tell you as soon as they had money,

1295
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,490
they were done.
It was like three days in the bar,

1296
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:11,690
cocaine binge face down in a ditch and 
then they were fine until they got money

1297
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:14,600
again.
And so I don't.

1298
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,960
The problem with the garden teed annual 
income solution is that man does not 

1299
01:18:20,631 --> 01:18:22,190
live by bread alone,
let's say.

1300
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:26,450
And that if you have money and you have 
things to do,

1301
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,420
then you have a life.
But if you just have money,

1302
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:30,830
you don't have a life.

1303
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,900
I'm looking at,
you know,

1304
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:39,130
I have a very narrow lens on this.
What do I know about the big social 

1305
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:39,890
policies?
And No,

1306
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,320
I don't know anything about that more 
than anybody else.

1307
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:47,321
I have opinions like everybody,
but my narrow lens is through 

1308
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,180
intelligence.
Yep.

1309
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,620
I think more is better than.
Less.

1310
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,730
More doesn't make you a better person,
doesn't make you honest,

1311
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,190
doesn't make you likable,
doesn't make your conscience does.

1312
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,920
It,
doesn't solve the problems of the world.

1313
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:05,660
But if we can do something to increase 
intelligence,

1314
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:10,661
generally I think that would go in some 
measure toward alleviating a lot of 

1315
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:13,490
these,
these,

1316
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:16,220
uh,
very complex problems.

1317
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,820
So I'm managing the homelessness 
problem.

1318
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:23,360
Some proportion of chronically homeless 
people have schizophrenia.

1319
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:29,230
Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder.
Nobody knows what the genes are or how 

1320
01:19:31,221 --> 01:19:36,221
they work,
but it's pretty clear there's a genetic 

1321
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:37,240
component.
If you can find the genes,

1322
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,990
figure out what they do and come up with
real good treatments.

1323
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:46,991
If chores for schizophrenia and possibly
preventions for schizophrenia,

1324
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,920
that indirectly is going to help 
alleviate the homeless problem.

1325
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:55,970
Right?
So I don't know what to do about the 

1326
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,151
homeless,
but if you can figure out what to do 

1327
01:19:58,151 --> 01:20:00,671
about schizophrenia,
that's going to have some impact on 

1328
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:00,671
that.

1329
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:01,560
Yes.
It's basically,

1330
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:06,561
yeah,
we'll use your claim to some degree is 

1331
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:09,171
that these more complex social problems 
should be into isolative or micro 

1332
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:14,301
problems and that specific solution 
should be sought for them and now that 

1333
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:14,301
certainly strikes

1334
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:16,860
me as an appropriate approach because 
everybody is different.

1335
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,580
Not everyone's the same reason.
No,

1336
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:20,700
no.
Well that's for sure.

1337
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,260
That's for sure.
Not everyone's poor for the same route,

1338
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,680
for the same reason,
by any stretch of the imagination.

1339
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,660
That's right.
Poverty is.

1340
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:32,661
Doesn't have one cause no,
not nearly caused by lack of money 

1341
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,920
either because that would be a much 
easier problem to solve unfortunately.

1342
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:42,921
It's not so simple.
So the one thing that we're probably 

1343
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:43,200
getting towards the end,
the one thing I would like to leave your

1344
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:48,201
listeners with is really optimism.
Not Dismal problems in perpetuity 

1345
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:53,220
because the genetic approach,
I think,

1346
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,530
and I'm kind of out,
you know,

1347
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:58,560
I'm kind of out there on this.
This is not a mainstream view,

1348
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,720
but I think the more something is 
genetic,

1349
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:05,721
the more lives we can change it and 
that's why we should study the genetics 

1350
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:07,800
of intelligence.

1351
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:11,360
That's why I hope genes have more to do 
with it,

1352
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,530
that environment,
not,

1353
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:18,531
no,
not yet because I want to do something 

1354
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:21,081
nefarious with jeeps and I understand 
the history of this varies because I 

1355
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:27,531
think in neuroscience there's,
there's optimism and to guard against 

1356
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:31,890
the negative aspects,
the potential negative aspects of this.

1357
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:37,100
The only solution is to have public 
conversation about this and we get 

1358
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,270
people to understand Iq,
intelligence,

1359
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:41,910
g factor,
these are not all the same things.

1360
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,160
They have different relationships to the
data,

1361
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:50,240
the genetic data particularly.
So we have to understand these things 

1362
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,350
and once we have some sense of this and 
not paint people who believe in that 

1363
01:21:55,051 --> 01:22:00,051
there's a genetic component is as our,
as our a priori racists or malevolent 

1364
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,310
people.
Um,

1365
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:03,230
I think we,
we,

1366
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,610
we can come to a common understanding 
about how genes and environment interact

1367
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:13,970
and figure out how all that works and 
begin to think how in the year 20,

1368
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,980
50,
or 20,

1369
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:22,090
60 are going to help them resolve,
resolve some of these issues to 

1370
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,760
practical benefit.
Well that is a good place.

1371
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:32,630
We've had a very productive discussion.
So I think that's probably a nice place 

1372
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:32,660
to,
to,

1373
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:37,690
to bring everything to a close.
I'd been speaking with Dr Richard Hire 

1374
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:41,960
who studies the neuro basis of human 
intelligence and cognition and who has 

1375
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,000
recently released a new book called and 
real science of intelligence published 

1376
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,890
by Cambridge University press.
It's an academic book,

1377
01:22:48,891 --> 01:22:53,891
but for people who are interested in a 
serious discussion of the relationship 

1378
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:58,100
between biology and intelligence,
then it's a good Goto Tome and,

1379
01:22:58,101 --> 01:22:58,700
uh,
it's,

1380
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:03,740
it's an extraordinarily important topic 
given the undeniable primacy of 

1381
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,940
intelligence as the fundamental 
predictor of,

1382
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,500
of,
of let's say,

1383
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,420
success in many,
many domains in,

1384
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,180
in,
across the human lifespan.

1385
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:15,940
So thank you very much for spending an 
hour or so with us today.

1386
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:16,490
And,
uh,

1387
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:23,160
and with any luck,
maybe we'll talk to you again in the 

1388
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,591
future.
I'd like to talk to you perhaps about 

1389
01:23:25,591 --> 01:23:25,591
consciousness at some point that might 
be entertaining.

1390
01:23:25,591 --> 01:23:26,030
Well,
I've listened to.

1391
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:31,031
I've really enjoyed it.
I appreciate the chance of family more 

1392
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:34,541
than three sentences.
Three sentences are related to your 

1393
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,840
listeners.
I just want to say one thing about the 

1394
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,191
book.
It is written for the lay public as 

1395
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:45,191
well.
That's a good thing to know.

1396
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:49,730
Cambridge wouldn't let me call it the 
neuroscience of intelligence called what

1397
01:23:49,731 --> 01:23:54,731
every parent and student needs to know 
about the neuro science,

1398
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:58,150
but because they wanted to market it as 
a strictly academic God,

1399
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:00,280
but I.
it's getting quite a bit of attention.

1400
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:02,100
Just a moment.
Nonacademic.

1401
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:03,340
Excellent.
Well,

1402
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:04,820
I'll,
I'll make sure that I.

1403
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,670
I mentioned that in the description 
which I will.

1404
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,460
I'll post the link to the book probably 
on Amazon.

1405
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:16,300
That's usually the most straightforward 
thing and also point out that it is in 

1406
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,170
fact written for people who aren't only 
specialists in the area.

1407
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,870
That was good.
Thanks.

1408
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,550
Thanks a lot.
Hey listen,

1409
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,090
thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

1410
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,630
No problem.
It's a pleasure talking with you too.

1411
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,540
Good to meet you.
