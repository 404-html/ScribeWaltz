1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
Today I'm talking to Jonathan Passagio 
who I think is touched with more than a 

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,860
little bit of genius and he's a 
Quebecois artists and a carver,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,910
a sculptor,
and I'd like to start by letting 

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,890
Jonathan tell us who he is and what he 
does.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,850
Okay.
So yeah,

6
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,590
I'm a,
I'm an icon carver,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,920
which means that I make,
I make carving for churches and for 

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,780
people of traditional images.
So I get commissions and I,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,030
and I work within a traditional language
of,

10
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,270
of,
of Christian art.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,400
I've been doing that for about five 
years now,

12
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:36,401
full time.
And before that I actually lived in 

13
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:36,560
Africa for seven years working with 
artisans.

14
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,010
They're trying to help them,
uh,

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,090
in their business practices and their,
their design skills.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,540
So I have a very kind of strange and 
varied background.

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,960
I studied fine arts at Concordia 
University here in Montreal.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,910
In the.
Yeah,

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,880
in the late nineties.
So yeah,

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
full time icon carvers.
Do you suppose there are in Canada and 

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
in Canada there the.
I'm the only one we're about actually in

22
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:03,641
the,
in the entire world where we're very 

23
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:03,641
few.
I actually know most of them.

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,270
Yeah,

25
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,530
it doesn't sound like a very easy thing 
to monetize.

26
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:12,531
So how did,
how in the world did you go from being 

27
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,320
a,
an art student trained at Concordia to 

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,360
being a carver of icons?

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,520
I studied painting and drawing at 
Concordia on the surface.

30
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,220
I was doing really well.
I actually finished first in my,

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,850
in my class,
but there was a malaise the whole time I

32
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,860
was working there because I'm a 
Christian.

33
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:31,861
I grew up,
I grew up a Christian and I was trying 

34
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,560
to figure out how that would connect to 
my art practice.

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,690
Uh,
and so I was,

36
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:38,691
I was looking,
trying to figure out symbolic languages 

37
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,850
and in painting and trying to find ways 
to talk about bigger,

38
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,420
bigger questions,
metaphysical ideas in my paintings,

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,660
but I didn't have the language so I was 
really just groping around almost blind 

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:48,820
and uh,
yeah,

41
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,160
it.
And at the end of my time at Concordia,

42
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,380
the professor who was supervising me,
she,

43
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,170
she basically said on the very last day 
she said,

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,940
what are you doing here?
This is not,

45
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,380
this is not the place for you.
After that I,

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,650
it kind of left me dangling,
you know,

47
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:04,930
and,
and a questioning a lot of things.

48
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:08,380
So what sort of education did you get a 
concordia?

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,440
All the fine arts programs now in,
in I think pretty much almost 100 

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,881
percent are based on contemporary art 
practices and so very few universities,

51
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:23,581
very few programs teach a technical 
skills or teach you how to draw in a,

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,040
in a classical way so they actually not 
really teaching anything.

53
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,230
It's hard to know exactly what they're 
doing.

54
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,410
I guess it was ever since the 19 sixties
through speeding this idea in the art 

55
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,521
world that technical skills and ability 
just aren't that important and that the 

56
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,290
important thing is to find your,
I would say your political voice,

57
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:46,240
but it's very strange to me that this 
has occurred because it seems to me that

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,380
before your voice is anything but a,
an off color Croak,

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,100
you have to become a disciple of a 
discipline and an apprenticeship and 

60
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,390
learn the tools and trades of craft and 
learn how to be an artist because 

61
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,250
there's a technical end to that.

62
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,880
I mean,
this is really almost an image of the 

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:08,880
world as it stands now.
The,

64
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,090
the,
the purpose or the stated purpose of,

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,610
of,
of modern efficient,

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,530
postmodern art was to free the artist,
right to break,

67
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,830
to break away all the things that were 
holding the artist back in terms of 

68
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,220
rules and in terms of,
of,

69
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,390
uh,
just the way things were presented.

70
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:27,391
But when ended up happening is that 
there were no more legitimate 

71
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:30,960
legitimizing objective or you know,
strong legitimizing structures around 

72
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:36,211
the art.
The only thing left was politics and 

73
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:37,270
relationships and status basically.
So our funders,

74
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,630
there's a big literature on creativity 
and it's strongly,

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,170
which I know very well.
My lab designed the creative achievement

76
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:49,171
questionnaire which is used.
It's been used in hundreds of studies 

77
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:52,111
now to assess lifetime creativity.
And so I've spent a lot of time looking 

78
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,610
at the measurement of creativity and 
also trying to understand creativity.

79
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,611
And the literature strongly suggest that
when you impose restrictions on people,

80
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,680
it actually makes them more creative 
rather than less.

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,460
Because part of what creativity is the 
overcoming of obstacles.

82
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,790
You know,
imagine someone who writes poetry and 

83
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:11,860
the Haiku format,
well,

84
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,640
it's,
it's very,

85
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,490
very restrictive and obviously 
arbitrarily sold,

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,880
but the fact of the restriction is 
partly what makes the poetic form 

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,340
possible.
The same thing is true.

88
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,990
If you think about playing a game,
there's a,

89
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,070
there's far more things that you can't 
do when you play chess than there are 

90
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,481
things that you can do,
but there's still an infinite number of 

91
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,901
variations of chess games.
So this idea that there's a dichotomy 

92
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,280
between structure and rules and 
creativity is,

93
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,360
is pernicious Lee false and contradicted
by the evidence

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,660
when you,
when you start to explore the art world 

95
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,971
and the way it works is there's an irony
there that it purports to not have 

96
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,530
boundaries on creativity and structures 
on Tina,

97
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,930
but they're actually extremely strict 
and they're hidden.

98
00:04:55,931 --> 00:05:00,931
They're,
they're kind of this pernicious thing 

99
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,530
underneath where we're actually you,
you have to present things in a very,

100
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:07,531
very precise way for it to be able to,
to enter into the legitimizing structure

101
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,590
of the,
of the gallery,

102
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,090
the,
the.

103
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,770
It's like the message that I was trying 
to work on.

104
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,700
And the,
um,

105
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,520
the,
the,

106
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,510
the structure of contemporary artists 
didn't fit together.

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,390
And so at some point I gave up on art.
I,

108
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,560
I had to work,
you know,

109
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,560
I had a studio and I closed it down.
I just destroyed all my paintings.

110
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,880
It was,
it was actually a moment of,

111
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,530
of kind of spiritual crisis for me.

112
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,980
And it's in that,
in that moment that I discovered many 

113
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,830
medieval art,
I discovered traditional Christian art.

114
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,080
And when I discovered traditional 
Christian art,

115
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,180
it was exactly what you were saying 
before,

116
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,420
the forms of Christian artwork kind of 
developed as a community would say as a,

117
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
the Christian community develop these 
forms that were actually extremely 

118
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,660
powerful and,
and,

119
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,580
and created like a,
a cosmic map basically.

120
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,760
And so you could use,
you could use these images as a type of 

121
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,430
Algebra to create a sacred,
a sacred language.

122
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,880
And so discovering that,
yeah,

123
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,100
I just felt like,
yeah,

124
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,940
it gave me so much possibility.
Well,

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
you're going back

126
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,750
like 800 years,
900 years into the history,

127
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:12,751
maybe even farther than that,
back into the history of traditional 

128
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,991
art.
So you say you discovered Christian 

129
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,080
iconography and I also know that you're,
you're,

130
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,140
you're an Orthodox Christian,
which is a strange thing for a 

131
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,140
quebecois.
So I don't know,

132
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,950
you're a pretty rare bird,
so maybe you could,

133
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,270
you could say a few words about the 
discovery of the iconography,

134
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:33,271
how that came about and also how it is 
that you converted to Orthodox 

135
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:33,271
Christianity.

136
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:37,860
Well,
I mean those two things are very 

137
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,860
intricately related.
I think during,

138
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,720
during university,
just like a lot of people,

139
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I,
I kind of got into an intellectual and 

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,100
spiritual crisis.
I was reading data and,

141
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,980
and all the postmodern theorists trying 
to wrap my head around this,

142
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:52,600
like what does this mean for me and what
is it?

143
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,500
What is going on?
Um,

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,990
and,
and it's in that kind of crazy time that

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,240
I started reading the church fathers 
and,

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,900
and reading more traditional breeding,
more traditional authors,

147
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,880
people who talk about traditions in 
different,

148
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,410
different cultures and realizing that 
this was really the solution for,

149
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,260
for me at least,
it was a solution to kind of get out,

150
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,580
get out of the chaos that,
that,

151
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,750
that the modern world that kind of 
fallen into.

152
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,580
And so it,
when it came with the art,

153
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:26,581
so looking at the art and seeing the 
patterns emerge and seeing that those 

154
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:30,991
patterns in the art were the same as you
find in scripture and the same that you 

155
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,790
find in liturgy in the same that you 
find in the stories that are around us,

156
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,820
even stories that aren't actually 
Christian to see those patterns emerge 

157
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,510
is what really caught my attention.

158
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,900
And,
and,

159
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:45,901
and so I was looking at first,
I wasn't necessarily going to be 

160
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,901
Orthodox.
I could see the patterns coming through 

161
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:48,901
and I was trying,
you know,

162
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,610
trying to figure out and I couldn't find
them in my own meat,

163
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,470
which is which I grew up evangelical.
Uh,

164
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,630
and so I,
I was looking for it,

165
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,430
I couldn't find it,
I looked at Catholicism,

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,300
but finally I,
I felt that I am looking at Orthodox.

167
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:05,530
I felt like Orthodoxy was the type of 
Christianity that had preserved the most

168
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,160
of that ancient worldview and was still 
living at today.

169
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,930
So it's a,
it's a living tradition.

170
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:11,380
It,
you know,

171
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:14,890
when you say you went back 800 years in 
a way that's true,

172
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,030
but it's not true for the Orthodox 
because they continue to perpetuate 

173
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,300
those,
those forums until today.

174
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,390
I mean,
not that they didn't go through rocky 

175
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,981
times,
obviously it's been crazy for orthodoxy 

176
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:29,260
as well,
but for some reason they've been able to

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,160
constantly revive their forums,
you know,

178
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,510
and today it's a thriving,
a thriving part of Christianity.

179
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,270
Well,
you know,

180
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,700
this idea of,
of this,

181
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,650
of this return,
um,

182
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,160
and,
and the continual revivification of 

183
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,620
traditional forms reminds me of two 
things.

184
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,560
It reminds me of the old Egyptian 
stories about horace and Noah,

185
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:55,561
Cyrus and Horus,
the Egyptian God of vision and 

186
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:55,700
attention.
So he's Egyptian,

187
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:55,980
I,

188
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,570
and the,
and the Falcon.

189
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,350
And after horace defeats Seth,
who's sort of Egyptian precursor to 

190
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:08,781
Satan and reclaims his throne,
he goes down into the underworld to 

191
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,230
rescue his father.
Oh Cyrus,

192
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,690
who,
who seth had chopped up into pieces.

193
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,000
And um,
when he's down in the underworld,

194
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,720
he gives,
oh,

195
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,330
cyrus one of his eyes,
which seth has torn out.

196
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:23,331
He gives him one of his eyes and then 
brings them back up to the surface and 

197
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:27,141
they rule Egypt together and the Union 
of Osiris and Horus was like the 

198
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,370
Pharaoh's soul.
So there's,

199
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:33,371
there's this ancient idea and it's 
expressed in more places than in 

200
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:37,070
Egyptian mythology that it's the duty,
it's the sacred obligation of someone 

201
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:41,460
who's awake to journey to the underworld
and revivified the corpse of his father.

202
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,800
And that not unites the individual with 
a living culture and also makes the 

203
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,571
culture alive because of course,
culture in some sense because it's the 

204
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,901
product of the dad is a dead,
is a dead entity.

205
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,650
It has to be continually revivified by 
the living.

206
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,140
And then you see that echoed in more 
modern form,

207
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,210
oddly enough,
in a Disney animated movie.

208
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:08,211
And Pinocchio,
and Pinocchio is the story of the 

209
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:08,700
struggle of a puppet,
a Marionette,

210
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,510
whose strings are being pulled by forces
that he does not understand.

211
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,370
It's the story of his struggle towards 
individuality and,

212
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,640
and rebirth.
And a number of things happen to 

213
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Pinocchio.
He has to learn not to lie.

214
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,320
He asked to learn not to be a neurotic 
victim because that's actually one of 

215
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,190
the temptations.
It's that it's,

216
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,710
it's his agreement that he's in neurotic
victim,

217
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,260
that,
that places him on pleasure island,

218
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:39,261
where he virtually,
where he's in danger of becoming a 

219
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:40,590
jackass and a slave to totalitarians.
Interestingly enough,

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,760
after he leaves pleasure island,
he goes to find his father,

221
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:49,761
but he can't find him.
And a note from the Holy Ghost 

222
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,150
essentially tells them that his father 
is at the bottom of the ocean,

223
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,340
in the belly of a giant whale.

224
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,340
And the whale is also a dragon.
And so then Pinocchio has to go down to 

225
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,361
the bottom of the ocean in his half 
jackass form and rescue his father from 

226
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:06,090
the belly of the whale.
And he does that by mastering fire.

227
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,920
And interestingly enough,
in the,

228
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,810
uh,
in the Pinocchio Video,

229
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,040
he's assimilated to the Christian symbol
of the fish in the belly of the,

230
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,900
in the belly of the whale,
Japan,

231
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,340
no couches,
a bunch of fish,

232
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,830
uh,
he thinks to eat them in any couches,

233
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:24,831
Pinocchio and confuses them with a fish.
Doesn't realize that having caught 

234
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,820
Pinocchio,
he's caught his own salvation.

235
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,250
Then they work together to get out of 
the whale's belly.

236
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,670
But there's this very old idea that 
especially in chaotic times when 

237
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,691
everyone's turned into a jackass and a 
tool of totalitarians that the way 

238
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:42,150
forward is to journey to the deepest 
possible recesses of,

239
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,440
of reality and revivify the farther 
something everyone needs to know.

240
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,830
And there's something,
I mean,

241
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,060
we'll see as our conversation continues,
you'll see how,

242
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,380
how,
how for me at least this goes,

243
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,010
is that for

244
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,040
me,
going back into the,

245
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,680
the Christian tradition and,
and,

246
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
and reconnecting with the Christian 
tradition has actually opened my eyes 

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,801
also to the world around me.
And so those patterns that I find in my 

248
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,310
own tradition,
the patterns that are kind of feeding my

249
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,330
life once they're integrated.
Now when you look around you,

250
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,270
you see them,
they appear everywhere.

251
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,730
The world is actually made of those 
patterns and you can recognize,

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
you can recognize those patterns in 
contemporary culture and you watch a 

253
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:27,100
movie and you can see that these,
these are the same patterns,

254
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,520
but it's the best way is like the,
the danger is to,

255
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,660
is to do it in an,
in a,

256
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,240
in a simply in an intellectual way.
I mean,

257
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:37,680
that's kind of all our danger.
It's connecting to a traditional,

258
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,020
you know,
becoming Orthodox and,

259
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,800
and living it through liturgy,
liturgy.

260
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:47,090
Um,
when you go to church and you 

261
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,400
participate in the liturgy,
you're physically engaging in,

262
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,120
in the sacred patterns.
And so it's,

263
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,970
it's a way to make it almost a bodily 
experience.

264
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,100
Right?

265
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,170
Well,
it's interesting,

266
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:54,710
you know,
the,

267
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,670
the,
the,

268
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,490
the Christian emphasis on the 
resurrection of the body,

269
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:03,491
which is of course something that,
that modern people have very difficult 

270
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:03,491
time with.
I mean,

271
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,290
people can perhaps swallowed the notion 
that the soul is immortal,

272
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,220
but the idea of the resurrection of the 
body is something that just seems beyond

273
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,620
the Pale.
But there's,

274
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,860
there's a logic to that insistence and 
the insistence is that there's something

275
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,790
sacred and necessary about the body and 
that it can't be forgotten,

276
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,130
um,
when,

277
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:24,770
when discussing both spiritual say on 
sacred matters.

278
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,850
So it's definitely the loss of the body 
that's part of what,

279
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,900
what constitutes part of the rootless 
nihilism that characterizes the modern 

280
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,920
modern age,
you know,

281
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:41,921
learned that partly by reading Carl 
Rogers because one of the things that 

282
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,340
Roger talked about was the necessity.
Young talked about this a lot as well.

283
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,310
The necessity of bringing the body into 
alignment with,

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,700
with Rogers,
it was more with the voice and he,

285
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,260
he claimed,
for example,

286
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:59,261
that you could feel with your body 
essentially whether or not your words 

287
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:03,791
were aligned properly with your being.
And certainly I've certainly learned 

288
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:08,230
that that's true and that you can learn 
to determine when your voice is making 

289
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,700
you stronger physically and when it's 
making you weaker physically.

290
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,970
A very,
very useful thing to pay attention to.

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,120
One of the iconic figures that you've 
carved and that you're interested in is 

292
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,021
St George.
And I've been very interested in the 

293
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:23,021
figure of St George.
Um,

294
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:23,820
I think the,
the,

295
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,850
the,
the story that's encapsulated in St 

296
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,320
George is certainly one of the oldest 
stories known to mankind.

297
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,410
It might be at the core of the oldest 
story because basically what it does is 

298
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,550
present human being the individual in a,
in a,

299
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,760
in a battle where the individual society
and the individual are being threatened 

300
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,030
by the reemergence emergence of are 
carnivorous,

301
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,280
Reptilian,
carnivorous Predator.

302
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,970
And I think the roots of the Saint 
George story go all the way back to the 

303
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,840
time when the distant ancestors of human
beings.

304
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:07,040
We're living in trees and being and 
being preyed upon by predatory snakes.

305
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:11,240
And that's about $60 million years ago.
Back when there were dinosaurs.

306
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:16,241
By the way,
an anthropologist named Lynn is bail at 

307
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:16,241
the,
at Ucla,

308
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:21,130
has done a series of studies showing 
that the reason that human beings have 

309
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,401
such amazing vision because we can see 
better than any other animal except for 

310
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,830
birds of prey,
is because our vision evolved to help us

311
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:32,831
detect predatory snakes in particular as
they crept up on us through the 

312
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:38,021
underbrush.
And she established that by noting that 

313
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,131
there was a powerful correlation between
the prevalence of predatory snake 

314
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:46,931
predation in primate populations across 
the world and the acuity of primate 

315
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:52,271
vision.
And it's also the case that our vision 

316
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:53,480
evolved just as the story in genesis 
suggests,

317
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,990
because of fruit,
because we see colors because we can 

318
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,840
detect to detect ripe fruit.

319
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,140
And so genesis insists that human beings
got their vision because of snakes and 

320
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,631
fruit.
And that seems exactly right from an 

321
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:12,521
evolutionary perspective,
but you can imagine the idea in St 

322
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:12,521
George,
there's,

323
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
there's a,
there's a dragon that reemerge is from,

324
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,090
it's,
it's a layer underground and it's a,

325
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,260
it's an eternal dragon.
Immortal Dragon.

326
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,860
And it threatens the community.
And St George goes out to to fight the 

327
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,470
dragon in single combat.
And as a consequence,

328
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,630
he,
he frees a virgin from,

329
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,810
from the snakes grasp,
just like Harry Potter does in the 

330
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,721
Second Harry Potter volume when he goes 
down underneath hogwarts to free Jenny,

331
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:45,490
who's the Virgin Virginia from the grips
of the basket lisc.

332
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,280
And the basket risk is the thing that 
turns you to stone with a single glance.

333
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,740
And Harry Potter is revivified by the 
way,

334
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:56,741
by the Phoenix.
His tears and the Phoenix produces a 

335
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:56,741
rebirth,
right?

336
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,520
Because this phoenix is a symbol of 
death and rebirth.

337
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,130
And so there's St George story is,
is embedded right in the depths of of,

338
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,190
of the Harry Potter Story.
But I think it's predicated on the idea 

339
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,371
that human beings,
men in particular forever have been 

340
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:15,830
fighting off the predations of the 
natural and the social world,

341
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,310
and the,
the idea that you free the virgin from 

342
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,560
the grasp of the serpent is that women 
have preferentially chosen to ally 

343
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:33,611
themselves with and mate with men who 
are capable of facing the Reptilian 

344
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,330
Predator.
And so it's the basic evolutionary story

345
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:43,331
of mankind that human beings learn to 
fight back against predators maybe to 

346
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:48,410
even find them in their layer instead of
waiting for them to attack.

347
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,740
And that women in their gratitude for 
that in their gratitude for the 

348
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,131
protection of infants.
Like there's often images of Mary 

349
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:58,131
raising Christ

350
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:58,150
up

351
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,140
out of the way from a predatory reptile.
Right?

352
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,770
And that's in reference to the genesis 
comment that this,

353
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,570
that Mary will bruise the head of the 
serpent with her heel.

354
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,750
It's an extraordinarily extraordinarily 
deep story.

355
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,840
It goes deeper than just the idea of the
serpent too,

356
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,510
because the ultimate serpent in some 
sense,

357
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,580
isn't the one that lives in the external
world.

358
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,180
The ultimate serpent might be the one 
that's in the heart of your enemies.

359
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,350
Or if you make a metaphysical 
transformation in your thinking,

360
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:31,351
even beyond that,
the ultimate serpent isn't even the one 

361
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,370
that lives in the heart of your enemies.
So it's not the natural snake or,

362
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:36,100
or the crocodile or,
or a Predator like that.

363
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,250
It's not the vicious barbarian that's 
come to the gates of your castle to 

364
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,660
steal your belongings and make off with 
your women.

365
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,110
It's the snake that lives in your heart.
And that's why Christianity insists on 

366
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:53,860
the association between the snake in the
garden of Eden and Satan.

367
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,760
Yeah,
I mean,

368
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,230
I think that if you,
if you,

369
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,500
if you think of of the world in terms 
of,

370
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,130
of,
of,

371
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,770
uh,
of macrocosm and microcosm,

372
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,470
the idea that,
that the,

373
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:11,471
that certain structures repeat 
themselves at different levels of 

374
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:11,850
reality,
that's like music,

375
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,470
right?
Then you,

376
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,160
you,
you,

377
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,110
you can think of this idea of a world as
having in the middle,

378
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,410
you know,
a tree or a cross or you know,

379
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,440
something like an access in the center 
and as you move away from that access,

380
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,481
you know,
from the access which defines the space 

381
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:32,850
basically like a flag or something like 
a post.

382
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,120
As you move away from that center,
you're moving further and further from 

383
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,130
what it defines and you're approaching a
chaos.

384
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,260
Basically,
you're,

385
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,740
you're,
you're approaching chaos,

386
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,840
which is in the negative sense.
It's chaos,

387
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,070
right?
In the positive sense.

388
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,480
It's also potential.

389
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,480
It's the potential from which that world
will,

390
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,630
will grow.
So it on one side it threatens the 

391
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,630
insight,
if you will.

392
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,050
And on the other side,
it is the potential by which that,

393
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,180
that,
that thing will grow.

394
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:05,181
And so the dragon in the Virgin in,
in St George's story there,

395
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,200
there are actually several versions of 
the of the dragon in some virgins and 

396
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,840
the most known virgins sent a St George 
will kill the dragon,

397
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,140
but there are lesser known versions of 
the story where he actually tames the 

398
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,290
dragon and the dragon into his pet,
you know,

399
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,380
and there's versions where he tames it 
then killed it.

400
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,690
Like there's different versions of the 
story,

401
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,050
but it's to show this idea of,
of as you move out,

402
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,200
sometimes there's something on the edge 
that that appears on the edge and you 

403
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,850
can't define it.
It's this chaotic thing.

404
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:40,851
It's the dragon in traditional way of 
represent representing it isn't just a 

405
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:40,920
reptile.

406
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,500
It's actually a hybrid creature.
It,

407
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,210
it usually has a mix of,
of,

408
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,830
of Lizard and it has hairy feet and 
wings.

409
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,180
And so it is,
it's this monster.

410
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,230
It's a monster.
It's an amalgamation of things to be 

411
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,410
frightened by,
but also treasure because the dragon 

412
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,260
doesn't only guard virgins that guards 
treasure,

413
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,770
it's in the.
It's in contact with what you fear and 

414
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,530
despise that the treasure is to be 
found.

415
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah,
you know in your your notion about the 

416
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,781
center point,
say with the flag or the cross reminded 

417
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:15,570
me,
reminded me of the way that children 

418
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,341
react with their mother and their home 
and so what a child will do when he or 

419
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:22,651
she is exploring the world is make 
contact with the mother and that and 

420
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:27,000
that's in the center of the household so
you can think about it as the mother 

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,000
embedded in society.

422
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,040
The child will will comfort himself with
contact with the mother and then go out 

423
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,740
into the world until the point where his
fear overcomes his exploratory tendency 

424
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,290
and then on the on that edge he'll play 
and further his psychological 

425
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:48,751
development and his mastery of the world
and then when he wears out and maybe 

426
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:52,420
goes beyond his limit,
he runs back to the center point for 

427
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,131
comfort and then the next time he goes 
out he can go out a little bit farther 

428
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,940
and so that.
That structure basically.

429
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,980
That is basically the structure of 
everything.

430
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:00,450
I mean,
yeah,

431
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,490
it's structure of the society.
It's a structure of a family and like 

432
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,581
you said,
it's also the structure of an 

433
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:08,581
individual,
uh,

434
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:09,340
were on the,
on the edges of our person.

435
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,610
We have these desires that exist on the 
edge of our person and those desires are

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,670
very dangerous because they,
they,

437
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,770
they can lead us into a lot of the mess,
but they're also,

438
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,000
uh,
by the,

439
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,340
the,
the tool by which we further ourselves.

440
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,230
That's very similar again,
to young's idea of the incorporation of 

441
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,170
the shadow and also you need,
she's idea of beyond good and evil.

442
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,490
I mean niche you meant by that at least 
in part beyond the conceptions of good 

443
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:41,500
and evil that are basically thrown up by
nothing but cowardice,

444
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,980
right?
So you try to make yourself into this 

445
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,661
little restricted thing that's basically
the union persona and you define 

446
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:50,320
yourself as good if you never go outside
that little box.

447
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,590
But to be truly good,
you have to go way outside that box.

448
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,660
So if you think,
take this as a,

449
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,700
as a worldview,
I mean basically that,

450
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,730
that has become my own worldview.
It helps you to identify what's 

451
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,750
happening around you.
So on the,

452
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:08,751
on the periphery of the world,
there are these marginal things that 

453
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:12,120
exists kind of in the buffer between,
you know,

454
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,480
order and an absolute chaos and those 
things,

455
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:17,100
they,
they all,

456
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,050
you know,
they rear their heads up and sometimes,

457
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,670
and so we have to have a trend.

458
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,610
We,
we transact with them in different ways,

459
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,670
sometimes tame them.
Sometimes you have to,

460
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,710
you know,
you know,

461
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,980
like a dragon,
you have to kill it.

462
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,890
Sometimes you have to just ignore it 
too.

463
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,990
Like monsters just have to be left alone
basically.

464
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,560
Like they're too big to,
to,

465
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,530
to deal with.
Yet you just leave them alone.

466
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,710
And to me,
this is really related to what you're 

467
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,850
going through right now.
It seems like this is where we are right

468
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:51,851
now in our society.
Our obsession with liminal things right 

469
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,790
now in the world seems to be a sign of 
something.

470
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,400
You know,
the word monster actually comes from the

471
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,710
Latin word,
which means to show,

472
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,260
right as a portent.
We in French,

473
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,770
we actually still have the verb 
motivate,

474
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,310
which means to show them.
Demonstrate in.

475
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,170
Yeah,
yeah.

476
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,220
There you go.
Demonstrate.

477
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,370
Exactly.
So the word a monster is,

478
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,650
is a portent of something.

479
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,650
It is.
It's like a harbinger of change or 

480
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,500
harbinger.
That's something you need to pay 

481
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,500
attention because something is 
happening.

482
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,900
And so right now to demonstrate to 
demonstrate is to de mon straight.

483
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,320
Yes.
Right.

484
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:35,321
It's to,
it's to take the monster apart and make 

485
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:35,321
it into something that's you can deal 
with.

486
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:40,120
Yes.
That you can master Marduk in the old 

487
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,740
Mesopotamian myth because mark who's the
Mesopotamian a hero,

488
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:47,741
God confronts tire mount who's a monster
and cuts her into pieces and makes the 

489
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:53,111
world.
And actually one of the names of that 

490
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:56,130
the Mesopotamians had was he who makes 
interesting and useful things from the 

491
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,580
combat with tire mount.
Yup,

492
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,250
Yup.
Yeah.

493
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,990
I mean so,
so right now we can you look around the,

494
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,150
if you think of a,
of the social manifestations that are 

495
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,150
going on,
like just take zombies for example,

496
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,060
like that's the greatest example because
the Zombie is an inbetween figure.

497
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,550
It's something that is neither dead nor 
alive.

498
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:17,540
It's,
it stands in between two categories.

499
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,740
And so,
so the,

500
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,950
in the case of the Zombie,
the Zombie,

501
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,030
because it is in between the categories 
is act as a parasite.

502
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,300
It starts to eat the interior.
The brain actually.

503
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,270
Exactly.
Yes.

504
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,290
It's looking for,
for,

505
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,190
for meaning.
It's so he wants to eat the thing that's

506
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,820
inside,
it's trying to devour it.

507
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,660
So the culture,
like the story of,

508
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,110
of,
uh,

509
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,830
of Oedipus and the Sphinx is the perfect
kind of image of this.

510
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,190
So the Sphinx appears as this undefined 
monster,

511
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,280
right?
It's a mix of a woman and a lion and a 

512
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,280
bird or whatever.
It's this thing that appears.

513
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,830
And so,
and what it is,

514
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,590
it's a question.
It's saying like,

515
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,580
what am I?
Well,

516
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,230
monster,
that is a question or it's an enigma.

517
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,030
The person coming forward is faced with 
this enigma and the danger.

518
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,770
So one possibility is that you name the 
monster and you're able to integrate it.

519
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,830
The other possibility is that you're 
eaten by the monster.

520
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,880
Those two things are a real reality 
right on the edge,

521
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,940
on the edge of things.
So when you come to the edge of 

522
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:21,940
something,
you know,

523
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:21,940
you have this,
this,

524
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,220
this,
this image,

525
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:27,221
and traditional stories of the bridge.
You come to the end of something and 

526
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,280
there's the bridge and on the bridge 
there's a,

527
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,510
there's a monster,
and so you have to face this monster 

528
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,510
because when,
when you're on the bridge,

529
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,370
you're in a dangerous place.
Your inbetween inbetween categories,

530
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:38,690
right?
You're in no man's land,

531
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,720
you're in no man's land.
And so the monster comes and wants to 

532
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,710
devour you.
So it can be either this idea of the,

533
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,090
the,
the monster asking question,

534
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,240
asking an enigma for you to be able to 
cross the bridge.

535
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Um,
and so this is what's happening right 

536
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:56,480
now.
Right?

537
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,261
And so there,
there are some elements that come from 

538
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:01,890
the margins of society which are 
standard.

539
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,970
The ones that I've been dealing with or 
has been the people who don't fit into 

540
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:06,970
the gender categories.

541
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,260
Yes,
yes.

542
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,620
And so that we're,
we're in a situation where we were 

543
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,200
those,
that manifestation of,

544
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,770
of hybridity,
right?

545
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,560
Because because if you look at the 
categories that are used,

546
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,620
they are,
they are trying to be the category of 

547
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,471
multiplicity itself.
I think they're trying to be the 

548
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:25,471
category.

549
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,090
That's why the categories are 
multiplying beyond name.

550
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,650
They started with just nonbinary and now
it's up to 70 on online.

551
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah,
it'd be what it is.

552
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:36,990
It's a decomposition like it's.
It's a decomposition of a category.

553
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,380
You come to the end of something and it 
starts to decompose.

554
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,770
I know in your talks you talk about the 
role of the serpent eating its own tail.

555
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,610
Well,
this is my vision of it,

556
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:50,500
is that when you first see that serpent 
youth,

557
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,730
it actually looks like it's the tail 
that eating the head and then after a 

558
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,711
certain transition,
then it becomes the head eating the 

559
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:04,041
tail.
So imagine the fruit falls on the 

560
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,041
ground,
the ground starts to eat it,

561
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:07,200
it starts to decompose,
and once it's fully decomposed,

562
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,510
then something happens.
There's a flip,

563
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,210
and now the seed starts to use the earth
and eat the earth to,

564
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,060
to become a tree.
And so there's that moment at the end of

565
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,800
something where there's a flip that 
happens,

566
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,800
like an inversion and then an inversion 
of an inversion that happens.

567
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,310
It's a very chaotic time.
And,

568
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,720
and that's the moment where we,
we,

569
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,000
we are in right now.
And what you're going through,

570
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:30,860
like the,
the,

571
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,920
the finger that you've,
you've put your finger on something 

572
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,661
very,
very critical and that's why there's so 

573
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:39,030
much noise about it is because you're,
you're,

574
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,790
you're standing right in that spot and 
you're pointing,

575
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,700
your telling everybody,
pay attention to this monster.

576
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,770
It's right there in front of us.

577
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,830
You talked before with me about two to 
biblical stories that shed some light on

578
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:56,831
this.
And you were talking about Abraham and 

579
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,160
the stranger.
And so maybe you could walk through that

580
00:28:58,161 --> 00:29:01,010
because I thought that was an extremely 
interesting analysis.

581
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,980
Okay.
So,

582
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,070
so I mean,
the way that in the Bible and in most 

583
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,521
traditional societies,
the way that you would deal with the 

584
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:10,521
strange.
Okay?

585
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:12,360
The thing that comes from the margins,
you know,

586
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,300
it's the stranger in,
in,

587
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,970
in,
in a,

588
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,710
in a global way.
It's this strange thing,

589
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,650
the way we deal with that is through 
hospitality,

590
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,280
right?
The first way we deal with it,

591
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,340
right?
The first way we deal with something 

592
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,931
coming from the outside and that doesn't
fit into our world is through 

593
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:32,130
hospitality.
So the hospitality,

594
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,970
hospitality means that you receive this 
thing as a,

595
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:41,030
as a stranger,
and there's these implicit rules of how 

596
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,900
you interact with them so that there 
isn't a mutual destruction basically.

597
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,600
Okay?
And so in the Bible we see those,

598
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,030
those,
uh,

599
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:53,070
version of,
of good hospitality and bad hospitality 

600
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,430
play themselves out.
So in the story of Abraham,

601
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Abraham receives a three strangers and 
he received them into his tent and he 

602
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,341
feeds them and he gives them,
he received them properly and the 

603
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:07,780
strangers are also acting properly in 
his tent.

604
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,010
You know,
they're eating his food,

605
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,110
but they're being respectful of the 
house.

606
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:16,111
They're not stealing things,
they're not trying to seduce his wife 

607
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,280
are doing the things that you're not 
supposed to do implicitly when you're in

608
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,310
someone else's house.
Um,

609
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,240
and,
and because of that,

610
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,080
the,
the,

611
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:27,520
the three strangers announced to Abraham
that he's going to have a child.

612
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,600
So Abraham is in his nineties,
you know,

613
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:32,890
you'd never thought they're angels.
They're secretly,

614
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:37,891
but they're secretly angels.
That's what's important is that in the 

615
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:38,230
strange,
the strange,

616
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:42,850
because the strange is an ambiguous,
a category.

617
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,940
It can contain both extremes.
It can contain both the angel and the 

618
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:47,940
devil,
right?

619
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,290
These three angels come to come to him 
and they announce that he's going to 

620
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,421
have a child.
And so what they do is that the strange 

621
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:58,330
now access this potential that we talked
about,

622
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:58,630
right?

623
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,630
So it's a fruit defying agent in this,
the case that an orderly structure has 

624
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:10,531
to allow an element of chaos,
an element of the strange into it in 

625
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:15,601
order to become something new and even 
to maintain its own survival because 

626
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,530
things have to become something new as 
they move forward through time,

627
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,820
right?
And so in this,

628
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:21,240
in that case,
the stranger becomes the,

629
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,850
the,
the,

630
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,960
the means by which Abraham's marriage 
is,

631
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,010
is,
is fucked up.

632
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,180
So he grows,
his family,

633
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:31,660
grows through this bright interaction 
with a stranger,

634
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,500
so now these same three strangers,
then they go to a visit,

635
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,540
Abraham's brother lot who's in Sodom and
Gomorrah,

636
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,530
and then although lot receives the 
strangers appropriately,

637
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,520
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah,
they wanted to rape these strangers.

638
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:55,550
They,
they want to sexually assault the 

639
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,310
strangers at end rape them and angels 
blind the people around them and they're

640
00:31:57,311 --> 00:32:02,311
able to escape and because of the wrong 
interaction and the sexual,

641
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:05,290
the sexual interaction with the,
with the,

642
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,450
between the stranger and the people of 
the city.

643
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,660
If the city is destroyed by fire and 
then it leads even further it,

644
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,820
it leads to having an incestuous 
relationship with his daughters.

645
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,680
And so it's like the whole world just 
kind of,

646
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,060
it collapses because there isn't a 
proper approach to,

647
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,010
to,
to hospitality and.

648
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:24,610
But it,
you know,

649
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,880
and in that story,
you see how it's actually.

650
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,820
So there's an intimation in there too,
is that if the,

651
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,480
if the,
if the interaction with a stranger is 

652
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,090
handled properly,
then everything becomes more fruitful.

653
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,210
And if the interaction with a stranger 
upsets things,

654
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:42,110
say as basic,
as basic as,

655
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,290
as sexual interactions between people 
than the entire society can become 

656
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,680
destroyed.
Exactly.

657
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,820
And,
and that ended,

658
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:51,590
and I'm using those two stories,
but,

659
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,770
but those two,
those two stories repeat themselves in 

660
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:56,770
all,
all of this.

661
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,611
I mean,
there's so many stories where you see 

662
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:00,611
that often it's not just sex,
it's often food.

663
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:05,590
There's sex and food.
Those are the two things that the two 

664
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,080
major ways in which we integrate the 
world.

665
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,400
So for example,
like the story of Hansel and Gretel for 

666
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,400
example,
is a,

667
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,400
is a,
is a,

668
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,550
is a perfect example of where the,
the desire to eat the people that to eat

669
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,880
your,
your,

670
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,270
your guests,
right?

671
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Or for example,
the mother in the Hansel and Gretel 

672
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,810
story because she's too good to be true.
And then she's all compassion.

673
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:28,490
The witch and the Hansel and Gretel 
story.

674
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,480
And you can tell that because she has a 
ginger,

675
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,330
she's,
she has a gingerbread house.

676
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,400
It's made of candy.
Yeah.

677
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,250
And like a house made of candy is too 
good to be true.

678
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,430
That's the social justice warrior 
overemphasis on compassion and inside 

679
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,250
she's just fattening the kids up,
constantly taking care of them,

680
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,830
but her fundamental wishes to devour 
them.

681
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,840
Yeah,
so like an example,

682
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,960
and then one more thing,
they've been abandoned.

683
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,970
Those kids who have been abandoned to 
the predations of the evil mothers 

684
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,200
because the family broke down like 
they're.

685
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,100
It's the stepmother who tells the 
farther,

686
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:07,190
if I remember correctly,
to abandoned the children in the forest.

687
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,130
Yeah.
So it's the breakdown of the family that

688
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:15,131
leads to the children being threatened 
by the eatable mother who's too good to 

689
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:18,941
be true.
She's compassion that's gone completely 

690
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:18,941
beyond.
It's,

691
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:19,000
it's,
it's,

692
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,910
it's tolerable limit cautionary tale,
that's for sure.

693
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:25,030
You see that,
you see that there's a story there.

694
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:27,190
There's so many stories of how the,
the,

695
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,290
the relationship between the host and a 
stranger goes,

696
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,260
goes wrong.
Like there's an effort and sometimes the

697
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:37,820
push comes from the host and sometimes 
the push can come from the guests.

698
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:42,821
Like there's a,
there's an Ethiopian tradition where 

699
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:45,740
it's almost an inversion of Abraham's 
story were able where a man receives 

700
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,400
three guests into his home and the three
guests serve him food,

701
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:49,790
which,
uh,

702
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,220
which ends up being a human being.

703
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,360
So he,
so he,

704
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:58,410
they,
they kind of trick the host into 

705
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,880
becoming a cannibal.
And then the host becomes like an out of

706
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:00,480
Control Cannibal.
And you know,

707
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,100
eating people all over the place.
So you can see how the story can go both

708
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,960
ways,
like the,

709
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:05,380
the,
the,

710
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,220
the,
the relationship with the strange can.

711
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,510
There can be a push from the inside,
from the right hand.

712
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:14,510
Let's say the order hand,
that can be a push towards,

713
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,460
uh,
that,

714
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,850
that,
that caused the cows.

715
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:21,851
But it can also come from the guests can
also come from the stranger which can 

716
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:24,560
push from his side or from their side.
And then create the chaos.
