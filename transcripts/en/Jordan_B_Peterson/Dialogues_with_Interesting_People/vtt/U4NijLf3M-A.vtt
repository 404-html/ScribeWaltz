00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>welcome to Sydney on your Australian </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>

3
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to a packed out houses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the interest is extraordinary and </v>

4
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>we've had the opportunity to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally and I can understand why I </v>

5
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.701
<v Speaker 1>want to begin with something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill wrote in the 19 thirties and </v>

6
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>he said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the signs of a great society,</v>

7
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>use the diligence with which it passes </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture from one generation to the next,</v>

8
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>when one generation no longer passages </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the things that are dear to it,</v>

9
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>its heroes and their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's religious faith,</v>

10
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's in effect saying that past is null </v>
<v Speaker 1>and void.</v>

11
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's of no value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes onto say,</v>

12
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that leaves young people feeling a lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of direction than a lack of purpose and </v>

13
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>opens them to the dictum of Karl Marx </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are people derived of the history,</v>

14
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily persuaded.</v>

15
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Have we stripped down the young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have purpose and meaning and left them </v>

16
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>open to being bullied around whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things about that that,</v>

17
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that I think are really worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth laying out.</v>

18
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>The for the first is an analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of memory.</v>

19
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people think that the purpose of</v>

20
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>memory is to remember the past and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the purpose of memory.</v>

21
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of memory is to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the past lessons to structure the </v>

22
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>future and that that's the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal memory.</v>

23
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you're done with a memory when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've extracted out the information </v>

24
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>that you can use to guide yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly in the future.</v>

25
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a traumatic memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

26
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:12.651
<v Speaker 1>that's really obsessing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you analyze that memory to the point </v>

27
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:17.331
<v Speaker 1>where you figured out how you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself at risk and you can determine </v>

28
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.411
<v Speaker 1>how you might avoid that in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the emotion associated with that </v>

29
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So memories are,</v>

30
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>has a very pragmatic function and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural memories.</v>

31
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out stories from our past that </v>

32
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>structure our future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need that because,</v>

33
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

34
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

35
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your life becomes neutral in a,</v>

36
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>in a meaningless sense.</v>

37
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's that your life becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by unbearable suffering </v>

38
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>because the baseline condition of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like unbearable suffering.</v>

39
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And what you have to set against that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a noble and worthwhile purpose,</v>

40
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully your determination of that </v>

41
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.761
<v Speaker 1>purpose is buttress to some degree by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom the past because you can't </v>

42
00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>conjure something like that up on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

43
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you provide people with nobility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of purpose,</v>

44
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:10.651
<v Speaker 1>then they can tolerate the suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence without becoming entirely </v>

45
00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cultures that don't do that,</v>

46
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it isn't even so much that they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cultures that don't do that are</v>

47
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>

48
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a story anymore and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a call to adventure and then,</v>

49
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>well then everyone suffers stupidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence.</v>

50
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Churchill made the same observation </v>

51
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.441
<v Speaker 1>that many of the great psychologists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers made in the early part of </v>

52
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:34.441
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.110
<v Speaker 1>bring this story forward and propagate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and make it the most noble possible </v>

54
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you motivate people to do,</v>

55
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>to transcend themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they need to do.</v>

56
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's exactly right in his diagnosis,</v>

57
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>just to stay with him for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's painted as the great defender of </v>

58
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.300
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that your country,</v>

59
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and certainly my country,</v>

60
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:02.981
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have not continued as free </v>

61
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.791
<v Speaker 2>societies had it not been for that man </v>
<v Speaker 2>courageously standing at a time when so </v>

62
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 2>few did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't the inventor of freedom.</v>

63
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Freedom is we understand it and I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to unpack that a bit.</v>

64
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people in very few cultures </v>

65
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 2>down through the ages and even today </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ever really experienced.</v>

66
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly because we're afraid of it.</v>

68
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 1>people think of freedom as the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to implement your whim and freedom opens</v>

70
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>up that as a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sustainable freedom,</v>

71
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what it's about at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about.</v>

72
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It's primarily about responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about determining which load you're</v>

73
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:46.531
<v Speaker 1>going to pick up and carry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the proper definition of </v>

74
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>appropriate freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not grout DM,</v>

75
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>gratification of instantaneous impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's self evident that that doesn't </v>

76
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.331
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year olds do that and that's why </v>

77
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.401
<v Speaker 1>they can't live in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't organize themselves across </v>

78
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.551
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't sacrifice the moment for the </v>

79
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>future and the more sophisticated you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

80
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:08.041
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in some sense the more you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do that and then your freedom </v>

81
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>becomes the freedom to choose the proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and that's not.</v>

82
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:16.021
<v Speaker 1>That's also not something that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been good at communicating to young </v>

83
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.021
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

84
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.050
<v Speaker 1>If we talk to them about responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't generally do it in a finger </v>

85
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.050
<v Speaker 1>wagging sort of way and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you're breaking the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad person,</v>

87
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 1>and and and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be true because people break </v>

88
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>the rules and there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>badness in people,</v>

89
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>but the proper message for young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to say,</v>

90
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take on responsibility.</v>

92
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>You want to take on the heaviest load </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can conceive of,</v>

93
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that you might be able to move because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives your life,</v>

94
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>nobility and purpose and that offsets </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragedy.</v>

95
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only psychologically.</v>

96
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it offset it </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically because you have a </v>

97
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>purpose and something to wake up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

98
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:56.251
<v Speaker 1>And to face the difficulties of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because if you face the </v>

99
00:05:56.251 --> 00:06:00.181
<v Speaker 1>difficulties of the day properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually ameliorate suffering not </v>

100
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:03.851
<v Speaker 1>only in the psychological sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because you make the world at least </v>

101
00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:05.800
<v Speaker 1>a less terrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something right?</v>

102
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>To move things away from hell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something even if you're not,</v>

103
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self evidently moving forthrightly to </v>

104
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.321
<v Speaker 1>heaven to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move things away from the worst they </v>

105
00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>can be as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a noble goal in and of itself.</v>

106
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and young people are starving for that </v>

107
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting to watch.</v>

108
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.300
<v Speaker 1>As I look at it,</v>

109
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.380
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that that actin headed </v>
<v Speaker 2>right freedom,</v>

110
00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:31.440
<v Speaker 2>properly understood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be seen as a negative.</v>

111
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.660
<v Speaker 2>And as a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The negative is,</v>

112
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.740
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this sort of concept of freedom from </v>

113
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.740
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

114
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.200
<v Speaker 2>persecution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karen,</v>

115
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 2>tyranny in a personal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

116
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:48.771
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to be used to reach your </v>

117
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.741
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to me that what's missing </v>

118
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.711
<v Speaker 2>is an understanding that freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise within a framework of </v>

119
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 2>responsibility are you doing what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ought.</v>

120
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.870
<v Speaker 2>We'll guarantee you ongoing freedom for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and for your neighbors.</v>

121
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Freedom exercised in a way that confuses</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with license tends to destroy </v>

122
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

123
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:13.071
<v Speaker 2>you could even go so far as to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood freedom turns out to be </v>

124
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.680
<v Speaker 2>its own worst enemy.</v>

125
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

126
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the difficult distinction between</v>

127
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>freedom of the moment and and freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the freedom with everything taken </v>

128
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.461
<v Speaker 1>into account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a real admirer of the work of </v>

129
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.071
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget is a developmental psychologist </v>

130
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:33.011
<v Speaker 1>and few people know the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>well known developmental psychologists </v>

131
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>and few people know that he was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated in his intellectual pursuits </v>

132
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>by the desire to reconcile science with </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

133
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>That was his driving force from the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was a young man.</v>

134
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.220
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know that even necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>by reading his writings because it's </v>

135
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>implicit rather than explicit in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

136
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a different model of what </v>

137
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>constitutes morality than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Freud.</v>

138
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Freud's model is combative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the super ego as tyrant.</v>

139
00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>So the superego would be the strictures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of society,</v>

140
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the in the biological impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the eagle crushed between those.</v>

141
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ego is this thing that's crushed </v>

142
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>between nature and culture and so it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

143
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a tense and combat of model of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human psyche and there's something about</v>

144
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:20.081
<v Speaker 1>it that's that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's accurate because some of the </v>

145
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>restrictions that are put on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse gratification are imposed on you</v>

146
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.880
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense to radically.</v>

147
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget's perspective was much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic and I think much more </v>

148
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:35.201
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He noticed that as children organize </v>

149
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>themselves spontaneously as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

150
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 1>especially within the confines of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own spontaneous play,</v>

151
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:44.290
<v Speaker 1>they didn't so much subsume art or </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibit their dark and aggressive </v>

152
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:50.381
<v Speaker 1>impulses as make them sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform them into universally </v>

153
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 1>acceptable games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Piaget,</v>

154
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>a game that a group of children were </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

155
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.810
<v Speaker 1>that all of them were playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and that was going well and </v>

156
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>that they all wanted to continue playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a microcosm of society and literally</v>

157
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>a microcosm of society.</v>

158
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.620
<v Speaker 1>The reason that children were playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>those games was to practice being </v>

159
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>productive members of society and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that the appropriate game tended </v>

160
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>towards what he described as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent braided state.</v>

161
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So when a criminal braided state would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a game that you'll play because </v>

162
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.021
<v Speaker 1>you've decided it's a good game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you can play with others </v>

163
00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 1>because they've also decided that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good game.</v>

164
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that can work at the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and at the familial level and at </v>

165
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.831
<v Speaker 1>the social level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get all those things working </v>

166
00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:39.201
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a sustainable enterprise </v>

167
00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's predicated not so much on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

168
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibition of impulse or on the </v>

169
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.801
<v Speaker 1>regulation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of the integration of impulses into </v>

170
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a pattern of being that gratifies </v>

171
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>them on a relatively permanent basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

172
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:59.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go to university and </v>

173
00:09:59.391 --> 00:09:59.391
<v Speaker 1>become a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's a lot of,</v>

174
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>a sacrifice of impulsive gratification </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with that.</v>

175
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But if you become a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a noble enterprise.</v>

176
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.910
<v Speaker 1>People support you socially and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the needs that you need to have </v>

177
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled will also be fulfilled by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

178
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a way better model and so it's </v>

179
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.181
<v Speaker 1>strange that the maximum freedom comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the adoption of a discipline and </v>

180
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:24.411
<v Speaker 1>then also the adoption of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that frees you up and everyone else </v>

181
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>around you in the long run and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that to people,</v>

182
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>especially in this day and age when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fed a never ending diet idiot rights </v>

183
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.841
<v Speaker 1>and freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're immediately on board with it </v>

184
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>because they know they know that most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that people experience in </v>

185
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.561
<v Speaker 1>their life as a consequence of adopting </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility so they're starving for </v>

186
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our idea to be articulated</v>

187
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.290
<v Speaker 2>opens up a whole can of very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting issue.</v>

188
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 2>So this try and pick a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the do.</v>

189
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>It's evident to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm enormously encouraged by this </v>

190
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.061
<v Speaker 2>because I'm passionate Australia and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>want this country to be the sort of </v>

191
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 2>place that offers opportunities of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort that I had when I was young.</v>

192
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>I've had my opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I look at my kids' generation,</v>

193
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.420
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be there for them if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep feeding the sort of scene grew in </v>

194
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people turning out in vast numbers.</v>

195
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Every one of your talks in Australia's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been oversubscribed massively.</v>

196
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 2>It tells you that I kind of get those </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortar,</v>

197
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.850
<v Speaker 2>this no know being told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

198
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.310
<v Speaker 2>they know</v>

199
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that's so </v>

200
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>interesting about dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal themes.</v>

201
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 1>You know archetypal themes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal because they actually speak </v>

202
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 1>of the structure of human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they last,</v>

203
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and so it's human nature and human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience has a pattern.</v>

204
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the capacity to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate that pattern as an individual</v>

205
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 1>in part because your life is too short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't figure it out,</v>

206
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient representations of those </v>

207
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.811
<v Speaker 1>patterns are everywhere around you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know some of them at the image you </v>

208
00:11:56.811 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>caught onto them automatically you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

209
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you fall into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to a movie,</v>

210
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:05.221
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because movies always expressed </v>

211
00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>archetipal themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hear them articulate it,</v>

212
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>

213
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how to say it.</v>

214
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the platonic idea of,</v>

215
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.310
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning as remembering your soul </v>

217
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>already knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have the words.</v>

218
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And so when people talk to me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching my lectures,</v>

219
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say they say they basically say </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of two things.</v>

220
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not just a simple thank you.</v>

221
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>They say one of two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A third of them say quarter for them,</v>

222
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>say we're not listened to you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if you're telling me things that</v>

223
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

224
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly right because that's</v>

225
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:45.391
<v Speaker 1>what archetypal stories are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The description of what you already </v>

226
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that can be articulated.</v>

227
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:50.881
<v Speaker 1>And then who you are and how you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the way you described </v>

228
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 1>yourself are all become the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's wonderful.</v>

229
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Then you're not at odds with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and then you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're a functioning unity and that</v>

231
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>makes you much stronger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>indomitable than you would otherwise be.</v>

232
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

233
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is more like three quarters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

234
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 1>is that they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a very dark place.</v>

235
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

236
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a fragment,</v>

237
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>good relationship with my fiance and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't getting married.</v>

238
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Things weren't going very well with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

239
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:18.910
<v Speaker 1>my relationship with my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was damaged.</v>

240
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any ame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wasting my time.</v>

241
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Some variant of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some combination of those.</v>

242
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

243
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching your lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided to establish a purpose.</v>

244
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to tell the truth and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are way better and I've.</v>

245
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say I've done maybe eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>or nine large scale public talks in the </v>

246
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>last two months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably 20,000</v>

247
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:47.761
<v Speaker 1>people and about half of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third to half of them estate </v>

248
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>afterwards to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's about 7,000</v>

249
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:53.311
<v Speaker 1>people who have said that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people stop me on the street </v>

250
00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>all the time and tell me exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

251
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 1>which is just wonderful.</v>

252
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't imagine how good it is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to go to places you've never </v>

253
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.871
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to have people start people on the </v>

254
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:03.871
<v Speaker 1>streets spontaneously and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

255
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 1>my life is way better than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

256
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

257
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and I've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

258
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters from people since last August.</v>

259
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep track of them.</v>

260
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:19.651
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three quarter a quarter of them </v>

261
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:19.651
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you've given me the words to say what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>already knew was true.</v>

263
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that in the audience.</v>

264
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because I can lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a story.</v>

265
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>People go like this and say they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that all the time.</v>

266
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like the lights are going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really wild.</v>

267
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing better than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch lights go on when you're </v>

268
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>talking to people.</v>

269
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

270
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But to get this response from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father,</v>

271
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father's about 80,</v>

272
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>80 is 83,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 81.</v>

273
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He's 81.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

274
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>I put it in charge of going through my </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer email,</v>

275
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>which is an overwhelming job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we've had discussions about this</v>

276
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:02.861
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's overwhelmed by the fact that so </v>

277
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:02.861
<v Speaker 1>many people are writing and saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

278
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

279
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I have a purpose in my life actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

280
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:11.861
<v Speaker 1>I finally realized that and I'm putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into practice and I'm bearing up </v>

281
00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>under the heaviest load I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really helping.</v>

282
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's tens of thousands of </v>

283
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 1>responses now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

284
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't hope for anything better </v>

285
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's zero harm in it,</v>

286
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just people putting their lives </v>

287
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.111
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not mucking about with other </v>

288
00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:32.111
<v Speaker 1>people and are trying to make broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

289
00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Social transformation is about which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea.</v>

290
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make their immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment better and it's working.</v>

291
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

292
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You say the zero harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say as a former legislator,</v>

293
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:49.391
<v Speaker 1>that there's an enormous amount of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a country is only the sum total of </v>

294
00:15:49.391 --> 00:15:52.901
<v Speaker 1>the people that make it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that they put together a </v>

295
00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>resilient contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to ask others to help them.</v>

296
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>The stronger the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the society and rapidly like.</v>

297
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:05.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was thinking the other day </v>

298
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:06.670
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a journalist asked me why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience by people are responding so</v>

299
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>positively to what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The young men for example,</v>

300
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

301
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:15.941
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm actually on their </v>

303
00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:18.731
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy </v>

304
00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:22.181
<v Speaker 1>that they're not wasting their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sad to see that people are </v>

305
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted denialists and depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxious and aimless and and perverse</v>

306
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 1>and vengeful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things.</v>

307
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:33.431
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to see people question whether </v>

308
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that's necessary and then to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise out of that.</v>

309
00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fun.</v>

310
00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I was at after my talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so overwhelming.</v>

311
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually think about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

312
00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:52.561
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was after my talk last night and so </v>

313
00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>all these people line up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their 15,</v>

314
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.270
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds with me and they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tentative.</v>

315
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:57.790
<v Speaker 1>They're excited and attentitive when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they come up to talk to me and then they</v>

316
00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:58.300
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds of time to tell me something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really listening to them and they're</v>

318
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>hesitant about whether or not to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good news about their life,</v>

319
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's often because</v>

320
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.130
<v Speaker 1>when people share good news about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

321
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.880
<v Speaker 1>people don't necessarily respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively,</v>

322
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give encouragement and people</v>

323
00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:22.510
<v Speaker 1>need so little encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>

324
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And so there comes something good and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's so good.</v>

325
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody says,</v>

326
00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:28.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting along better with my father,</v>

327
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:33.511
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him for 10 years and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get along great and that,</v>

328
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.580
<v Speaker 1>the power of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't overstate the power of that </v>

329
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>for individuals to get their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

330
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:44.221
<v Speaker 1>They individuals and unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful force and every single person </v>

331
00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Speaker 1>who gets their act together a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the capacity to spread that around </v>

332
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

333
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a chain reaction and so it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely thing to see and that's </v>

334
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

335
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>My observation of atheists would be they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't live like atheists.</v>

336
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't live as though they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe they just a cosmic accident and </v>

337
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no purpose well eater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

338
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.780
<v Speaker 1>the best of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of respect for the atheists</v>

339
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>generally because they've generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought a lot more about this situation </v>

340
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and struggled with it more than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complacent fundamentalists,</v>

341
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wallpaper over their doubts with,</v>

342
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with overstatements about their belief.</v>

343
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:28.671
<v Speaker 1>The atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the word Isaac means our </v>

344
00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:31.941
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word Israel means he who struggles </v>

345
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:31.941
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

346
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:35.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that it's not the </v>

347
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:35.301
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>they're struggling away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're obsessed with it even,</v>

349
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and so they have God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on their mind than the typical </v>

350
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.830
<v Speaker 1>person who's a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it it.</v>

351
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been this little community develop </v>

352
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 1>around my biblical lectures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular of people who call themselves</v>

353
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Christian atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite remarkable.</v>

354
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So if I lay out the rationale for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian ethic,</v>

355
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:57.490
<v Speaker 1>which is something like pick up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn cross and struggle uphill,</v>

356
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

357
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that makes a lot of sense.</v>

358
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

359
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the metaphysical baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

360
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.500
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you do and maybe you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even to pick up the,</v>

361
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practical utility of that idea,</v>

362
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 1>which is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

363
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to follow on that then.</v>

364
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 1>So it strikes me that a lot of young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

365
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is enormously do their </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit and goes to the heart.</v>

366
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I think of what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told that morality is relative.</v>

367
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't live that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking for truth,</v>

368
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:29.940
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

369
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 1>if you live that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone hates you.</v>

370
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the grade that.</v>

371
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

372
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:39.651
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good example of how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are can be out of sync with how </v>

373
00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you represent yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was walking with,</v>

374
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I was walking through these ideas with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience last night.</v>

375
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

376
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>how do we treat each other when things </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

377
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how do you treat yourself?</v>

378
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

379
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to treat yourself like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter because if you don't,</v>

380
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:57.070
<v Speaker 1>then you don't take care of yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become vengeful and,</v>

381
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 1>and cruel and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take,</v>

382
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you take it out on people around you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a positive force.</v>

383
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 1>None of that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you suffer more.</v>

384
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:10.011
<v Speaker 1>And so does everyone around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a malevolence that enters </v>

385
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:10.011
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that's good.</v>

386
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>So that's what happens if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself like you matter.</v>

387
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you don't treat other </v>

388
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>people like they matter?</v>

389
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lie to them,</v>

390
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you cheat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you steal you,</v>

391
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you enter into impulsive relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

392
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.450
<v Speaker 1>They can't trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't go anywhere.</v>

393
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

394
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you end up alone at best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe like incarcerated at worst,</v>

395
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 1>like that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you watched the people around you</v>

396
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:39.681
<v Speaker 1>who thrive regardless of what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They act out the proposition that </v>

397
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a functional society </v>

398
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

399
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 1>well if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

400
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>if when you act out the proposition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone matters,</v>

401
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:53.281
<v Speaker 1>you have a functional society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's evidence that that </v>

402
00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:53.281
<v Speaker 1>proposition is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

403
00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true.</v>

404
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that the individual has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spark of divinity within him or her,</v>

405
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I think there isn't a more true way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that.</v>

406
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And if you act that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>

407
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 1>goes back to the idea that you brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>up about potential,</v>

408
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>which is also something I've discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my audience is a lot.</v>

409
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't act like we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>material reality.</v>

410
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 1>We act like we face a landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

411
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>an external landscape of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>within internal reservoir of potential.</v>

412
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we call each other out on it.</v>

413
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 1>We say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

414
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>you're not living up to your potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>in persons go.</v>

415
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I know.</v>

416
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

417
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

418
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean there's more to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>than meets the eye?</v>

419
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not measurable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not tangible,</v>

420
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone accepts that as though </v>

421
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.631
<v Speaker 1>that's a reality and we all act as if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all act as if we make choices about what</v>

422
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.110
<v Speaker 1>reality to bring into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it we,</v>

423
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

424
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 1>we punish ourselves for our moral errors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people as well.</v>

425
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:01.110
<v Speaker 1>We act out this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ethic that puts us each at the </v>

426
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.191
<v Speaker 1>center of being as active participants </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world that we want to bring </v>

427
00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone acts that way and if we don't,</v>

428
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.190
<v Speaker 1>then things go to hell instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

429
00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we believe?</v>

430
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 1>This is the argument I've had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Sam Harris,</v>

431
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 1>the atheist types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

432
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:15.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're atheist,</v>

433
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're Christian.</v>

434
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say to the court,</v>

435
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you just don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't realize it and it's </v>

436
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 1>understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not helpful.</v>

437
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.620
<v Speaker 2>This idea that you put forward have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spark of divinity in every human being,</v>

438
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 2>surely lies at the heart of the miracle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of western freedom.</v>

439
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 2>The idea that every individual has worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dignity and standing.</v>

440
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.960
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that killed slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slavery is a human rights movement of </v>

441
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.561
<v Speaker 2>all times so successful that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>obliterated the idea that it was I had </v>

442
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 2>to keep slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone change the law.</v>

443
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>It changed the way the world full even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though there are evil,</v>

444
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 2>evil people who still keep slides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a rub.</v>

445
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 2>It was plainly laid by people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound Christian faith.</v>

446
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who honestly,</v>

447
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>honestly and truthfully it looks at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of that period,</v>

448
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:13.411
<v Speaker 2>can't get away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it doesn't suit the modern </v>

449
00:23:13.411 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 2>lifts narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's airbrushed out.</v>

450
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That in itself says something profound </v>

451
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>about our willingness to try and distort</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

452
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 2>to suit our object?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what?</v>

453
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it,</v>

454
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>what it speaks of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

455
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

456
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

457
00:23:26.901 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the white washing of what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

458
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.750
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet states now in the </v>

459
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.121
<v Speaker 1>Communist states in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody who goes through that </v>

460
00:23:36.121 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 1>literature with any degree of care comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

461
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Traumatized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

462
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Shellshocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

463
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

464
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 1>it's everything the Nazis did on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger scale.</v>

465
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet I see with my students do 60 </v>

466
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:52.450
<v Speaker 1>million people who dared to disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

467
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at minimum it was in their own culture.</v>

468
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.240
<v Speaker 1>There was something in their own society</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know way in.</v>

469
00:23:57.241 --> 00:24:02.241
<v Speaker 1>In the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the estimates range from 20 to $60 </v>

470
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.840
<v Speaker 1>million and in Mao's China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the estimates are as much as $100,</v>

471
00:24:03.841 --> 00:24:06.800
<v Speaker 1>million or a kids taught this in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

472
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Universities are very.</v>

473
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I say this before preference slumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The modern fight in it seems to me in </v>

474
00:24:16.731 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>many ways is between what might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>called freedom and fed them for fairness</v>

475
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equality sounds terrific.</v>

476
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've actually seen what happens in </v>

477
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>societies where they set a quality up as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal.</v>

478
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I became terrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that happen?</v>

479
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

481
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whitewashing is we can't understand how </v>

482
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 1>one of our primary moral intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be fairness,</v>

483
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:50.351
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can transform itself into something so </v>

484
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:52.460
<v Speaker 1>utterly murderous when it's played out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a large political stage,</v>

485
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think because we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

486
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's reasons to be on the left.</v>

487
00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 1>There are temperamental reasons first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of your political preference is</v>

488
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

489
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.560
<v Speaker 1>by your temperament and a lot of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament is influenced by biological </v>

490
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are temperamental reasons to be</v>

491
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>

492
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 1>People who are on the left tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher and creativity and lowering </v>

493
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

494
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two best predictors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also practical reasons to be</v>

495
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.880
<v Speaker 1>on the left and one of the practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons are that human societies which </v>

496
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 1>tend to be hierarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all animal societies are almost all</v>

497
00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:33.581
<v Speaker 1>animal societies producing inequality as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go about their business and </v>

498
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 1>inequality is actually quite painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one likes it.</v>

499
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no rich capitalist walks down a busy </v>

500
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.891
<v Speaker 1>urban street and sees a starving </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless person who's clearly mentally </v>

501
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:49.781
<v Speaker 1>ill suffering madly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thanks that evening that inequality </v>

502
00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks that no one's for poverty,</v>

503
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have this moral intuition that</v>

504
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>would be better if the downtrodden were </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifted up and it's difficult to </v>

505
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 1>discriminate between that and then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>any quality narrative.</v>

506
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And so I think part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't face the,</v>

507
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.490
<v Speaker 1>the lesson of the 20th century is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the left that mostly has to</v>

508
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.910
<v Speaker 1>face the lesson and they don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile their deep intuitions about</v>

509
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:18.911
<v Speaker 1>the injustice of inequality with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that when you put that doctrine in </v>

510
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into into operation as a political tool,</v>

511
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you instantly stack up millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpses.</v>

512
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what to do with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we just avoid it and that's well.</v>

513
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Then of course we risk replicating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not good.</v>

514
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good tactical move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

515
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>If we don't learn from history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're destined to repeat it.</v>

516
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I entirely accept and some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies might be surprised by this.</v>

517
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I say I can't understand that</v>

518
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 2>lifting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I can.</v>

519
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:50.481
<v Speaker 2>I can understand the nobility of wanting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ensure that everyone is respected as </v>

520
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 2>a full member of the of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

521
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.340
<v Speaker 2>all of our culture and our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is where it gets tricky and </v>

522
00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think many young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are starting to wake up.</v>

523
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 2>They're being sold a pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have that expression in Canada?</v>

524
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.560
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soda Pop.</v>

525
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.780
<v Speaker 2>The Dod is not a sound idea that many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that sound attractive don't </v>

526
00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:16.401
<v Speaker 2>necessarily work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so perhaps we need to be arguing the </v>

527
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:20.181
<v Speaker 2>case for freedom and fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will produce at least a high </v>

528
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.481
<v Speaker 2>degree of equality of opportunity rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than arguing for equality,</v>

529
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>which history tells us tends to severely</v>
<v Speaker 2>eroded freedom.</v>

530
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a harder sale because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy to appeal to you</v>

531
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 1>passionate immediately thoughtlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since that's such an instantaneously</v>

532
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 1>positive moral virtue and you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated argumentation to buttress </v>

533
00:27:47.921 --> 00:27:50.140
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more difficult to make a cold</v>

534
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:55.310
<v Speaker 1>analytical case that the proposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom first,</v>

535
00:27:55.421 --> 00:27:59.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say freedom and responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>first lifts the bottom up better.</v>

536
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a cold argument and it requires</v>

537
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 2>rationality to parse through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a harder sale.</v>

538
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality,</v>

539
00:28:06.131 --> 00:28:11.131
<v Speaker 2>it's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you bring rationality and honesty to </v>

540
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 2>the study of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

541
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.500
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

542
00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:14.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case is actually quite compelling.</v>

543
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's open and shot.</v>

544
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

545
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a book that I've just been </v>

546
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:22.410
<v Speaker 2>reading that I would recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

547
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:22.520
<v Speaker 2>by a man named [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walter Shadelle,</v>

548
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.130
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book called the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>leveler,</v>

549
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.280
<v Speaker 1>which I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an empirical analysis of </v>

550
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.711
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had his research questions were </v>

551
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:32.711
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

552
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

553
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.250
<v Speaker 1>what is the phenomena of inequality to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you attribute it and what,</v>

554
00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:41.750
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we do to ameliorate it?</v>

555
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first answer is something akin to</v>

556
00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:48.380
<v Speaker 1>what I wrote in the first rule in my 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules for life,</v>

557
00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:49.130
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

558
00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:54.131
<v Speaker 1>you can't lay hierarchy and inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the feet of western civilization or </v>

559
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:55.850
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done with that argument.</v>

560
00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.910
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal societies are hierarchical and </v>

561
00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.901
<v Speaker 1>they produce on equal distributions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence for that in the </v>

562
00:29:04.901 --> 00:29:06.470
<v Speaker 1>biological realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back a third of a billion years,</v>

563
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's happened for so long that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system has primarily </v>

564
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.910
<v Speaker 1>adapted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a deep reality and blaming it on</v>

565
00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:14.840
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

566
00:29:14.841 --> 00:29:17.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality's a big problem.</v>

567
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse than mark's thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

568
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.820
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people tend to stack up at zero.</v>

569
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes your society to have people</v>

570
00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:31.361
<v Speaker 1>who are so far down in the underclass </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have nothing to lose by </v>

571
00:29:31.361 --> 00:29:35.680
<v Speaker 1>flipping the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about idea and it drives male on </v>

572
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>male homicide as well in social science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidence for that as clear.</v>

573
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we want to ameliorate inequality to </v>

574
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.281
<v Speaker 1>some degree because we want people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stack up at zero and d stabilize the </v>

575
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:47.140
<v Speaker 1>society and we don't want young men in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular to become violent.</v>

576
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then shadelle takes another tack.</v>

577
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:54.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like hit his observations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked at Neolithic grave sites for </v>

578
00:29:55.131 --> 00:29:57.990
<v Speaker 1>signs of inequality and you see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are buried with.</v>

579
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And in one of his cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 200 people in a grave and one of</v>

580
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:05.971
<v Speaker 1>them has 190 pounds of gold and the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>richest person has like four ounces of </v>

581
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone else has none.</v>

582
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even in these neolithic societies and</v>

583
00:30:09.171 --> 00:30:14.171
<v Speaker 1>equality was the rule hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies or the same way except the </v>

584
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 1>inequality isn't material because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a surplus.</v>

585
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Inequalities everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

586
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So then shadelle asks two other </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

587
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

588
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 1>how has it generally been reduced</v>

589
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.220
<v Speaker 1>pestilence and war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

590
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.790
<v Speaker 1>So you can reduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equality if you demolish everything </v>

591
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:34.950
<v Speaker 1>because that just brings everyone down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to zero,</v>

592
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but the inequality is less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he does an empirical analysis </v>

593
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and asked a very interesting practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

594
00:30:42.181 --> 00:30:47.181
<v Speaker 1>which is imagine that you taught it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inequality coefficients of the right</v>

595
00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:52.701
<v Speaker 1>wing societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you did the same with the left wing </v>

596
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:55.521
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference between the </v>

597
00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:55.521
<v Speaker 1>inequality coefficients and you'd hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

598
00:30:55.521 --> 00:31:00.231
<v Speaker 1>because you'd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd hope that what would happen as a </v>

599
00:31:00.231 --> 00:31:02.661
<v Speaker 1>consequence of activity on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that something would actually </v>

600
00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 1>occur to ameliorate inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found no evidence for that </v>

601
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.801
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the left is sensitive to the </v>

602
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.360
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

603
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but their compassion oriented doctrines </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to ameliorate that on the </v>

604
00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:21.150
<v Speaker 1>positive side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of resentment on the left</v>

605
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:22.890
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to sweep that under the</v>

606
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.160
<v Speaker 1>under the rug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're compassionate oriented policies </v>

607
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.860
<v Speaker 1>do not produce an improvement in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal distribution of goods.</v>

608
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's a way bigger problem than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

609
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

610
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and putting into place these,</v>

611
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 1>these thoughtless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate doctrines,</v>

612
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say putting them in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

613
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:45.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just gonna</v>

614
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.840
<v Speaker 2>produced exactly the same outcomes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were produced all through the 20th </v>

615
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.511
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must learn again to bring the wisdom </v>

616
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.791
<v Speaker 2>of the past back to the table of today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're to find our way out of the </v>

617
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.360
<v Speaker 2>malaise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's affecting the west,</v>

618
00:31:57.361 --> 00:31:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a better place.</v>

619
00:31:58.651 --> 00:31:59.630
<v Speaker 2>But before we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yep.</v>

620
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore that line of thinking.</v>

621
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the great sages down through the </v>

622
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you make that point in this </v>

623
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.010
<v Speaker 2>fascinating book of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a obliquely at least,</v>

624
00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly though the founder of </v>

625
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think would,</v>

626
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:16.560
<v Speaker 2>would say two</v>

627
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 2>a person that your personal freedom is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing you need to get right and </v>

628
00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:26.000
<v Speaker 2>sorted first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one by one.</v>

629
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking of young Australians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I feel so passionately about that as </v>

630
00:32:31.681 --> 00:32:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

631
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy not to be free,</v>

632
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.600
<v Speaker 2>very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addiction,</v>

633
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

634
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that act of discipline,</v>

635
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 2>lack of discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your whims.</v>

636
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to a society which set a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality as its goal,</v>

637
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the pursuit of that equality </v>

638
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.960
<v Speaker 2>killed 60 or 70 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the estimate of those who </v>

639
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 2>disagreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had a different view,</v>

640
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 2>who lost their freedom of those who even</v>
<v Speaker 2>announced their own suffering because in</v>

641
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:13.301
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dared to say that things weren't </v>

642
00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 2>going so well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you were instantly a political,</v>

643
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

644
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were political criminal for </v>

645
00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:19.901
<v Speaker 2>announcing your own suffering because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Utopian already arrived.</v>

646
00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Speaker 2>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you were still suffering will </v>

647
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Speaker 2>obviously there was something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

648
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine a society like that where </v>

649
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>your own suffering becomes criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will.</v>

650
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.160
<v Speaker 2>But let's come to Alexander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

652
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:38.610
<v Speaker 2>we know a lot about what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of him and he became an </v>

653
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 2>incredible global figure when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>young man and I read his book.</v>

654
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:46.181
<v Speaker 2>The Gulag archipelago here is as men who</v>
<v Speaker 2>describes the horrors of being a </v>

655
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:48.370
<v Speaker 2>political prisoner because he disagrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

656
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he converted.</v>

657
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.680
<v Speaker 2>He was originally a supporter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communism.</v>

658
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 2>He came to see how evil it was and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive it was.</v>

659
00:33:55.701 --> 00:34:00.701
<v Speaker 2>He was imprisoned for having a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>view to the state ordained insistence </v>

660
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that everything was terrific and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>writes unbelievably that lying on his </v>

661
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 2>prison bunk one day listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods beat up a fellow prisoner,</v>

662
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 2>the screams and the yields.</v>

663
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>He found freedom when he realized the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dividing line between good and evil in </v>

664
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't lie between capturing captive.</v>

665
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Giles,</v>

666
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:27.941
<v Speaker 2>we're captive to a system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a blonde ideology to an inability to </v>

667
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>think trustees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were perpetrating the very </v>

668
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.200
<v Speaker 2>system that imprison them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not between Catholic and baptist.</v>

669
00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:36.830
<v Speaker 2>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not between woman and man,</v>

670
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:41.831
<v Speaker 2>not between black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dividing line between evil actually </v>

671
00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 2>lost somewhere across every human heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the.</v>

672
00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 2>You believe it's incredibly important </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we understand.</v>

673
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 2>That comes back to what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when it's framed,</v>

674
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:53.831
<v Speaker 2>we understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that everyone knows </v>

675
00:34:53.831 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 2>because all they have to do is think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their own transgressions.</v>

676
00:34:55.431 --> 00:35:00.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask someone to sit for five </v>

677
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:00.431
<v Speaker 2>minutes and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

678
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 2>well what mistakes have you made in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

679
00:35:01.461 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like hod that'll come up pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and you can even ask people what</v>

680
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>terrible unforgivable mistakes have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made in your life?</v>

681
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

682
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we know about those too.</v>

683
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's no one's no one's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>naive,</v>

684
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless,</v>

685
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>unless they've really wrestled intensely</v>
<v Speaker 2>against themselves,</v>

686
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>there's virtually no one so naive to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to answer those questions.</v>

687
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So we know that we've done things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have done and we know that </v>

688
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 2>we're not living up to our potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

689
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.040
<v Speaker 2>but are we doing a truth in a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>disservice?</v>

690
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Trying to imply</v>

691
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 1>that there's nothing wrong with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

692
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:41.150
<v Speaker 1>You need for guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no need for Shaman.</v>

693
00:35:41.151 --> 00:35:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I need to come up with evil because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

694
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things that so funny about </v>

695
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.381
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that you've just got to </v>

696
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:51.381
<v Speaker 1>fix society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing institutions.</v>

697
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there'll be all this will </v>

698
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists have been,</v>

699
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.910
<v Speaker 1>not all psychologists obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the psychological profession is its </v>

700
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.300
<v Speaker 1>neck deep in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this pathology has been beating the </v>

701
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 1>self esteem drum for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

702
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should feel good about yourself.</v>

703
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine the way you are.</v>

704
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a calming message for </v>

705
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.260
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

706
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

707
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched my audiences.</v>

708
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:20.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's full of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience who think I'm suffering a lot </v>

709
00:36:20.781 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 1>more than I think is tenable a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of.</v>

710
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It's my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life is not in the order it should </v>

711
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.210
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm doing 50 things wrong.</v>

712
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell's wrong with me?</v>

713
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:31.941
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with the people around me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really serious and some well </v>

714
00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:32.410
<v Speaker 1>meaning person comes up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

715
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you're okay just the way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

716
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 1>no one wants that message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

717
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not okay the way I am.</v>

718
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not okay at all the way I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

719
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>

720
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 1>when I'm speaking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm speaking now,</v>

721
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

722
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 1>you're nowhere near what you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

723
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the positive message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

724
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a mass,</v>

725
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:53.960
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to stay that way as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a master,</v>

726
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're suffering away like,</v>

727
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 1>like so much you can barely tolerate it.</v>

728
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

729
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.700
<v Speaker 1>You can do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing that turns the </v>

730
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.971
<v Speaker 1>lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could do something about </v>

731
00:37:07.971 --> 00:37:07.971
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

732
00:37:07.971 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're in a freezing prisons hill in</v>

733
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the most appalling circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half stuff to death.</v>

734
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 1>He funds freedom in himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He find something positive and something</v>

735
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:20.280
<v Speaker 1>to live for by first coming to grips </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

736
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:22.620
<v Speaker 1>evil and understanding what it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conundrum in.</v>

737
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Then he said to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

738
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he underwent the Christian process of </v>

739
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Metanoia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to go over your.</v>

740
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

741
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 1>it's confession essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unrepentant wasn't mediated by religious</v>

742
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:39.681
<v Speaker 1>structure Solzhenitsyn's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was exactly the same process and </v>

743
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 1>he knew that perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>

744
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.830
<v Speaker 1>He said when he was in the prisons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that he was at least in part to </v>

745
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 1>blame for his own imprisonment and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment of everyone around him that</v>

746
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:52.370
<v Speaker 1>that was his fault or at least his </v>
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

747
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 1>both his fault and his responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to take that on.</v>

748
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.040
<v Speaker 1>He said the first thing he did was he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went over his life with a fine tooth </v>

749
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 1>comb in memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his goal was,</v>

750
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:07.701
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to remember everything I did </v>

751
00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:10.680
<v Speaker 1>when in my life up to now where I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I knew to be wrong and </v>

752
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:15.570
<v Speaker 1>not because of some external authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>defining it as wrong,</v>

753
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 1>but in relationship to his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

754
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

755
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and then he was going to determine if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some way that can be rectified</v>

756
00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 1>now to atone for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

757
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.960
<v Speaker 1>To to become at one with it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that was part of the process he </v>

758
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.081
<v Speaker 1>undertook and the concluding consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that was that he wrote the Gulag </v>

759
00:38:33.081 --> 00:38:35.220
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely overwhelming.</v>

760
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.830
<v Speaker 1>That blew the intellectual slats out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation of communism permanently.</v>

761
00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One solution isn't published until now.</v>

762
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:49.351
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be trying to gloss over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Academia seems to be full of people who </v>

763
00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:53.311
<v Speaker 1>want to soft pedal and reinstitute this </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive view that if we just create the </v>

764
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>right institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody will behave rationally,</v>

765
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 1>will all be equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will be okay.</v>

766
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 1>They want to reinforce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Won't say that,</v>

767
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but that's where they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to enforce it.</v>

768
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

769
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easy and it's only a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>short decades since all of that </v>

770
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.630
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we mad?</v>

772
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

773
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 1>We're characterized by inertia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

774
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to understand history.</v>

775
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.890
<v Speaker 1>It's especially not if you read it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

776
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read.</v>

777
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I had a client at one point who was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably naive person.</v>

778
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.980
<v Speaker 1>You cannot overestimate her naivete no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter how hard you try.</v>

779
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Her parents taught her that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that adults were angels,</v>

780
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she believed that in a strange sense</v>

781
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:42.770
<v Speaker 1>when I met her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in her twenties and,</v>

782
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had this extraordinarily naive </v>

783
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.800
<v Speaker 1>view of people and had been hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're very naive and you've been</v>

784
00:39:51.801 --> 00:39:56.801
<v Speaker 1>hurt by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often disintegrate because it blows </v>

785
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:56.801
<v Speaker 1>your world apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what had happened to her.</v>

786
00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And I said she had a university degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

787
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:00.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

788
00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:00.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

789
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

790
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:02.480
<v Speaker 1>in the liberal arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

791
00:40:02.481 --> 00:40:05.090
<v Speaker 1>didn't you read any history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

792
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

793
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

794
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:11.240
<v Speaker 1>how did not disturb the whole adults are</v>
<v Speaker 1>angels hypothesis?</v>

795
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

796
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just compartmentalize it.</v>

797
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And that gave me a key to what was wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her and we successfully dealt with </v>

798
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.431
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had her to begin her process of </v>

799
00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 1>cure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>

800
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.320
<v Speaker 1>because she had to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence because she had been touched</v>

801
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:28.040
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

802
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:33.041
<v Speaker 1>She had to understand it because her </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive worldview had been shattered by </v>

803
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:36.611
<v Speaker 1>the hand of malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to read a book called ordinary </v>

804
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:36.700
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

805
00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.210
<v Speaker 1>by Browning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

806
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>it's the study of these Polish </v>
<v Speaker 1>policeman,</v>

807
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 1>a German policemen who were sent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland after the Nazis had marched </v>

808
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.721
<v Speaker 1>through Poland and they were sent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>police Poland and they were know decent </v>

809
00:40:51.721 --> 00:40:55.520
<v Speaker 1>middleclass guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially most of whom had been hit </v>

810
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 1>maturity before Hitler had come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

811
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't indoctrinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis,</v>

812
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

813
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.120
<v Speaker 1>not like the Nazi youth types were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had to go to Poland and and be </v>

814
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:11.761
<v Speaker 1>policemen under wartime conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had a very humane commander and</v>

815
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:17.251
<v Speaker 1>he told all of them that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to do things that would be far </v>

816
00:41:17.251 --> 00:41:18.820
<v Speaker 1>more brutal in all likelihood that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were normally prepared to do in.</v>

817
00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>They're in Seville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the role as,</v>

818
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:22.540
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as non military policemen,</v>

819
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but that they could go back to their old</v>
<v Speaker 1>job if they wanted to.</v>

820
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't top down enforcement of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian ethos and browning </v>

821
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 1>documents their transformation.</v>

822
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 1>The guy next door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>the policeman next door and to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were taking naked pregnant women out</v>

824
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:43.421
<v Speaker 1>into fields and shooting them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the head and it's a brutal book </v>

825
00:41:43.421 --> 00:41:46.900
<v Speaker 1>because while these men that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just ruined the to do that to </v>

826
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:52.391
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were physically ill during the </v>

827
00:41:52.391 --> 00:41:52.391
<v Speaker 1>process of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

828
00:41:52.391 --> 00:41:56.831
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does a very good job of </v>

829
00:41:56.831 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>documenting how an ordinary person </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms into a,</v>

830
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.620
<v Speaker 1>a Nazi murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had to read that.</v>

831
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you compartmentalize it?</v>

832
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.980
<v Speaker 1>This is about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

833
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.030
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you read history you think,</v>

834
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>well that's about someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

835
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.710
<v Speaker 1>unless maybe you're a victim and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with the victims,</v>

836
00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:17.711
<v Speaker 1>it's a very rare person who reads </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and identifies with the </v>

837
00:42:17.711 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unless you read history and identify</v>

838
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:24.311
<v Speaker 1>with the perpetrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't understand history at </v>

839
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:24.311
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

840
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And so who wants to understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get my students.</v>

841
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

842
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I've told him this for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something you have to understand.</v>

843
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.940
<v Speaker 1>If you were in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistical probability is </v>

844
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming that you would have been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator,</v>

845
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you would have rescued and </v>

846
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:44.580
<v Speaker 1>frank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

847
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 1>think again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are very,</v>

848
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

849
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.700
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put their lives on the line to do </v>

850
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.671
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put their family's lives on the </v>

851
00:42:54.671 --> 00:42:56.441
<v Speaker 1>line to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're one of those people </v>

852
00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 1>really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that means is that you know nothing.</v>

853
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.860
<v Speaker 1>You know nothing about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know nothing about people you know </v>

854
00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.290
<v Speaker 1>nothing about politics or economics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

855
00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a harsh lesson by truth about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany in the 19 thirties.</v>

856
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.820
<v Speaker 2>It was probably the most educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

857
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and seen to that point in time.</v>

858
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Education alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleverness in inverted commas alone,</v>

859
00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:22.410
<v Speaker 2>intelligence alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil right,</v>

860
00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.440
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

861
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.320
<v Speaker 2>So absolutely there's no substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

862
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.860
<v Speaker 2>So we don't want pascal cold about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold talk to the glory and the scum to </v>

863
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:40.981
<v Speaker 2>reach our full humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me we need to understand </v>

864
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 2>both intention now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Young,</v>

865
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:47.550
<v Speaker 2>the unbelievable scum that laws in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our potential at the bottom of every </v>

866
00:43:48.461 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extraordinary nobility,</v>

867
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you call it the spark of divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

868
00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.770
<v Speaker 2>made in the image of an of a mighty </v>
<v Speaker 2>creator.</v>

869
00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.670
<v Speaker 2>You've got to hold those things in </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspension if you're,</v>

870
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.680
<v Speaker 2>if you've defined your real humanity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact have a good place is surely </v>

871
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.630
<v Speaker 2>through the valley of darkness in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

872
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you think,</v>

873
00:44:09.701 --> 00:44:11.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's possible to be enlightened,</v>

874
00:44:11.171 --> 00:44:11.190
<v Speaker 2>heightened,</v>

875
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.230
<v Speaker 1>why isn't everyone enlightened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

876
00:44:13.231 --> 00:44:15.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to paradise.</v>

877
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:17.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to heaven without </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrowing Health First.</v>

878
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who's going to do that?</v>

879
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a terrible thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't even clear that you can survive</v>

880
00:44:23.551 --> 00:44:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

881
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

882
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:31.320
<v Speaker 1>it's brutally damaging to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your own proclivity for malevolence</v>

883
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and so people don't do it and it's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder.</v>

884
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing is,</v>

885
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and this is also something that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

886
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that people have been watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lectures have been attracted by,</v>

887
00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 1>especially the young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like until you know your,</v>

888
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 1>until you understand that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

889
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 1>until perhaps you even develop that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

890
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the moral forced to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

891
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and so not only is that dissent to begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

892
00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 1>s s necessary to scare you straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to make you understand what </v>

893
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.931
<v Speaker 1>exactly it is that you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even have the strength of </v>

894
00:45:05.931 --> 00:45:09.231
<v Speaker 1>character to be good until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand just exactly what sort of </v>

895
00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:09.231
<v Speaker 1>monster you can be.</v>

896
00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I have a rule in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule five,</v>

897
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 1>do not let your children do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you dislike them.</v>

898
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a meditation on the monstrousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>of parents.</v>

899
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't underestimate yourself,</v>

900
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 1>your capability to ruin your children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

901
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You let them act in a manner that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you disapprove of them.</v>

902
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You will take revenge on them in ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot even imagine.</v>

903
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Unless you understand that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be careful enough as a parent </v>

904
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to set proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>

905
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children and Noi you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad idea.</v>

906
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that means that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to regulate your proclivity to be </v>

907
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.811
<v Speaker 1>annoyed and you should try to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized and you should talk to your </v>

908
00:45:53.811 --> 00:45:56.781
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife or your husband about your </v>

909
00:45:56.781 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 1>oversensitivities and foolishness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

910
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:01.140
<v Speaker 1>you need to know who the monster is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

911
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we're washing that wisdom out,</v>

912
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound condemnatory here </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more sympathetic and concern for </v>

913
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:10.160
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in our family homes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

914
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and the environment in which our kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>are being raised.</v>

915
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

916
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you're very passionate in your concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>for those people.</v>

917
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:22.851
<v Speaker 1>So we don't want anyone to think he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to condemn them for the </v>

918
00:46:22.851 --> 00:46:22.851
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the opposite.</v>

919
00:46:22.851 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 1>But if we're watching this out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

920
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 1>what then happens to our kids when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit institutions,</v>

921
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges,</v>

922
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

923
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

924
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Find out because increasingly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary and the school systems that </v>

925
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:46.341
<v Speaker 1>our kids are going through from say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age of five to the age of 18 are </v>

926
00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:48.620
<v Speaker 1>increasingly occupied by the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxists theologies.</v>

927
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to learn to identify </v>

928
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a start.</v>

929
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's buzzwords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

930
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 1>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>

931
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:00.020
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

932
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a no go zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity,</v>

933
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that's equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a preposterous murderous doctrine</v>

934
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.910
<v Speaker 1>masquerading in sheep's clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

935
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 1>white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic racism,</v>

936
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those.</v>

937
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 1>None of those as individual topics </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't necessarily off the table,</v>

938
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can have an intelligent </v>

939
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 1>discussion about any of them except </v>
<v Speaker 1>equity because that's just a no go zone.</v>

940
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.640
<v Speaker 1>But to see those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

941
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.910
<v Speaker 1>those concepts emerge as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a network of meaning,</v>

942
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're in the presence of this,</v>

943
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 1>this pernicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern,</v>

944
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxist doctrine that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally ideological at its core.</v>

945
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And people need to see that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to understand what that means and </v>

946
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>they need to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how they're going to stop it,</v>

947
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual decisions about that,</v>

948
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 1>but at least they could start by </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying,</v>

949
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and I've suggested to parents in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

950
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:55.290
<v Speaker 1>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as soon as teachers talk to their </v>

951
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 1>children about diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusivity and equity,</v>

952
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suggest to their children that they</v>

953
00:47:59.801 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>leave the class because they're no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer in the educational realm.</v>

954
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 1>They're in the indoctrination realm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't taking that.</v>

955
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say they're not taking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

956
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to figure out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds very,</v>

957
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 1>very radical to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

958
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 1>to suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 1>encouraging your children to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

960
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.970
<v Speaker 1>But I think we're at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wonder why our universities in our </v>

961
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.710
<v Speaker 1>high quality courses in how freedom was </v>
<v Speaker 1>secured by Western societies for its </v>

962
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 1>individual member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

963
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

964
00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:36.271
<v Speaker 1>and how it might be secured and how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>secured fairness from unfairness.</v>

965
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Those sorts of things are not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

966
00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:45.031
<v Speaker 1>some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of it has to do with what </v>

967
00:48:45.031 --> 00:48:45.860
<v Speaker 1>we've been speaking about is that to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

968
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 1>to address the problem squarely is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite daunting.</v>

969
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 1>We knew the difficulties are manifold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is real,</v>

970
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 1>individual malevolence is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To constrain it inside yourself is </v>

971
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.960
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily daunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To read history as a perpetrator is </v>

972
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.350
<v Speaker 1>traumatizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are hard things,</v>

973
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Speaker 1>and then to think through the problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>of addressing something like inequality </v>

974
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:13.950
<v Speaker 1>instead of reacting to it in a knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk,</v>

975
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:18.990
<v Speaker 1>compassionate manner in that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement policies on that basis that </v>

976
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 1>are going to be counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also extraordinarily difficult.</v>

977
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So there's difficulty is part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I would also say,</v>

978
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't talked about the resentment </v>

979
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:31.200
<v Speaker 1>that drives the discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>

980
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like every one on the left is </v>

981
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by compassion and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these brutal things tend to happen.</v>

982
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It's that they're also overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of jealousy that Kayden </v>

983
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.441
<v Speaker 1>had for Abel and the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous impulses that emerge very </v>

984
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of that jealousy.</v>

985
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 1>He has more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must be a perpetrator.</v>

986
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.200
<v Speaker 1>It's morally obligatory for me to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>him out.</v>

987
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 1>That's an easy message to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read about how the communists deep,</v>

988
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Deep Kula cooler heist the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>countryside.</v>

989
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine Russia,</v>

990
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you're in a village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 30 years,</v>

991
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the service have been emancipated,</v>

992
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:16.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a few agriculturalists who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to produce successful </v>

993
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 1>agricultural enterprises and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a couple of cows,</v>

994
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:23.641
<v Speaker 1>they have some land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're able to hire a few people and </v>

995
00:50:23.641 --> 00:50:23.641
<v Speaker 1>they're raising almost all the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

996
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.860
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're a minority in any village </v>

997
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 1>because the hyper productive successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>are always a minority.</v>

998
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>So they're minority in every village.</v>

999
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and,</v>

1000
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and there's people who are doing worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a lot of people who </v>

1001
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.491
<v Speaker 1>aren't doing so well at all and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communist intellectual show up and they </v>

1002
00:50:42.491 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>tell the people who aren't doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1003
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.740
<v Speaker 1>some of whom are just suffering because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>

1004
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:50.741
<v Speaker 1>but some of whom aren't doing well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've never done anything </v>

1005
00:50:50.741 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 1>productive with even a second of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1006
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And the communist intellectuals come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

1007
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys that are doing so much better</v>

1008
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.260
<v Speaker 1>they actually stole that from you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're morally obligated to go take it </v>

1010
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1011
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1012
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 1>after after six cups of mead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1013
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:14.470
<v Speaker 1>or let's say 10 or let's say 20 and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk out of my mind and I've got my </v>

1014
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 1>crew of buddies with me and we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

1015
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:20.951
<v Speaker 1>right to the core because we've wasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>our miserable lives and now we have an </v>

1016
00:51:20.951 --> 00:51:24.431
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to go like down the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>to our wealthy neighbors house and to </v>

1017
00:51:24.431 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 1>rape his daughters and we can do it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of good.</v>

1018
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1019
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:32.021
<v Speaker 1>there's a story you can market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happened everywhere in the </v>

1020
00:51:32.021 --> 00:51:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they wiped out the Kulaks.</v>

1021
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1022
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And then 6 million Ukrainian starve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1023
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1024
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Pharma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1025
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Do your crime was the breadbasket of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

1026
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it became a region pathetically </v>

1027
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.000
<v Speaker 1>unable to feed itself and yet the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of world view that gave rise to </v>

1028
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:56.081
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're now being told you use the word </v>

1029
00:51:56.081 --> 00:51:56.081
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1030
00:51:56.081 --> 00:52:00.520
<v Speaker 1>many people in Australia use the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural Marxist have got an old friend </v>

1031
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:00.820
<v Speaker 1>who said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1032
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.480
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John?</v>

1033
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 1>And I free capitalist Australia is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to let that happen here.</v>

1034
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quanta's airlines took a nice step </v>

1035
00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.101
<v Speaker 1>towards that the other day and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted their language policing </v>

1036
00:52:15.101 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These corporate,</v>

1037
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:20.380
<v Speaker 1>these corporations who should know far </v>
<v Speaker 1>better let these far left fifth columns </v>

1038
00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.671
<v Speaker 1>into their organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're not going to pay for </v>

1039
00:52:24.671 --> 00:52:27.401
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to stop with some </v>

1040
00:52:27.401 --> 00:52:27.401
<v Speaker 1>demands for the reconstruction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

1041
00:52:27.401 --> 00:52:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Not like the demands for reconstruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of language by the way are trivial.</v>

1042
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:34.250
<v Speaker 1>There may be the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly demand,</v>

1043
00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to reshape the way you speak.</v>

1044
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to reshape the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1045
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1046
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 1>As long as it doesn't interfere with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom line.</v>

1047
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like huddle interfere with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom line.</v>

1048
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.550
<v Speaker 1>You let that fifth column in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a warning to corporate people.</v>

1049
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 1>You let that fifth column in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1050
00:52:48.321 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to regret it.</v>

1051
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.480
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And things can turn on a dime.</v>

1052
00:52:53.481 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very well organized minority,</v>

1053
00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:00.980
<v Speaker 1>even if the majority of poses them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do very well organized minority</v>

1054
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 1>can have an unbelievably pernicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on,</v>

1055
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our organization.</v>

1056
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Mead's made that point when a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small group of people decided to change </v>

1057
00:53:10.181 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 1>its direction that that's the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>history works.</v>

1058
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened in the </v>

1059
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.251
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's come back to this issue of the </v>

1060
00:53:18.251 --> 00:53:21.050
<v Speaker 1>redefining of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that there are two things</v>

1061
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that people would want to reshape </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and brutal ways,</v>

1062
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1063
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 1>The first</v>

1064
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 2>is they start the silence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good debate.</v>

1065
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Either silence or shut it down or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1066
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Second thing they do is they redefined </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

1067
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's very hard to have a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So diversity actually,</v>

1068
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no other way to put it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country is rapidly coming to mean a</v>

1069
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:47.100
<v Speaker 2>stifling conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot not deviate from the line.</v>

1070
00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see it with a whole lot of other</v>

1071
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:54.711
<v Speaker 2>words that are bandied around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Equality being one of them because it's </v>

1072
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:56.440
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Equality of opportunities,</v>

1073
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.850
<v Speaker 2>confused with the quality of our.</v>

1074
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial wedge was equality of </v>

1075
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that flu and and so while.</v>

1076
00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1077
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's equity and that's,</v>

1078
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe how rapidly that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the ultimate and terrible </v>

1079
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.951
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how rapidly that spread </v>

1080
00:54:15.951 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 1>and how little people criticize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1081
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:20.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a couple it to uninformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1082
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good if you're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessly.</v>

1083
00:54:23.451 --> 00:54:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1084
00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Passionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you got back to the Ukrainian </v>

1085
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:29.440
<v Speaker 2>example in destroying the leading edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers.</v>

1086
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.630
<v Speaker 2>You actually guaranteed misery forever.</v>

1087
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on unbelievable.</v>

1088
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:37.790
<v Speaker 1>People were selling human body parts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ukraine for food.</v>

1089
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1090
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:44.170
<v Speaker 1>If you were a mother and your children </v>
<v Speaker 1>were starving and you went out into the </v>

1091
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:48.251
<v Speaker 1>fields after they were harvested and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up individual pieces of grain </v>

1092
00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:52.220
<v Speaker 1>that the harvesters had left and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't turn them over to the state.</v>

1093
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.560
<v Speaker 1>That was a capital offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1094
00:54:55.250 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the funny thing is that that </v>

1095
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:00.590
<v Speaker 1>was in the glory days of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

1096
00:55:00.591 --> 00:55:02.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't in the 19 fifties.</v>

1097
00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:05.300
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't in the 19 thirties even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in the 19 twenties.</v>

1098
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That was right when this started and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it was,</v>

1099
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Malcolm Muggeridge who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was reporting on that for,</v>

1100
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.480
<v Speaker 1>for a UK newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose name escapes me at the moment.</v>

1101
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.210
<v Speaker 1>He was pointing all this out and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid it.</v>

1102
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention towards the end of his life.</v>

1103
00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:25.021
<v Speaker 2>He warned that the west is in danger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating itself out from within and I </v>

1104
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:28.651
<v Speaker 2>wonder whether in fact he wasn't being </v>
<v Speaker 2>very appreciative and you and I want to </v>

1105
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:29.020
<v Speaker 2>stop that happening for the sake of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>young people,</v>

1106
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.490
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went down that pathway already.</v>

1107
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.560
<v Speaker 2>We need to do that things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History should be like science in the </v>

1108
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.381
<v Speaker 2>sense that it ought to be objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ought to be told truthfully it was </v>

1109
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:47.130
<v Speaker 2>not to be used to secure some dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

1110
00:55:49.181 --> 00:55:52.360
<v Speaker 2>preferred version of society.</v>

1111
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also why.</v>

1112
00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.390
<v Speaker 1>See what I've been trying to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because I've thought this through.</v>

1113
00:55:56.391 --> 00:55:57.440
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1114
00:55:57.441 --> 00:55:59.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

1115
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the group identity game ends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

1116
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who plays it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Left wingers,</v>

1117
00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:08.600
<v Speaker 1>play it blood right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play it lots and lots of it,</v>

1118
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:13.630
<v Speaker 1>not just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't play the identity politics </v>

1119
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.630
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1120
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:17.800
<v Speaker 1>what do you do instead you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live the mythologically heroic life </v>

1121
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 1>as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right place to work and </v>

1122
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the message of the as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

1123
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.190
<v Speaker 1>is that we figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out that the collective </v>

1124
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 1>identity was not the pinnacle statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the individual,</v>

1125
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 1>not the collective identities have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

1126
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Obviously family has value and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your organizations have value,</v>

1127
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the issue.</v>

1128
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 1>The issue is what's the paramount value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the metric by which people should</v>

1129
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 1>be measured and the answer is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be measured as individuals,</v>

1130
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.950
<v Speaker 1>as if they have a divine soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be measured in that manner,</v>

1131
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.390
<v Speaker 2>but it can't be a selfish thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to say,</v>

1132
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:57.740
<v Speaker 2>if I recognize I have worth and dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obliged to recognize it.</v>

1133
00:56:57.741 --> 00:56:58.220
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1134
00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can recognize that you have </v>

1135
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.170
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic worth and dignity without also</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing without also recognizing and then </v>

1136
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:10.301
<v Speaker 1>others and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I can recognize the </v>

1137
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:13.731
<v Speaker 1>worth of another person without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without stumbling onto the idea that I </v>

1138
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:17.811
<v Speaker 1>also have to recognize that for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you think while everyone would </v>

1139
00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:17.811
<v Speaker 1>want that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

1140
00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:22.611
<v Speaker 1>People don't because you're also charged</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the responsibility of your own care</v>

1141
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.740
<v Speaker 1>as if you matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1142
00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:29.741
<v Speaker 1>that's a big responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a lot easier to assume that </v>

1143
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>everything is pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's painful and all of that,</v>

1144
00:57:32.221 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1145
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't bear any responsibility and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one lives that way.</v>

1146
00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:36.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1147
00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Well No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not for long.</v>

1148
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Not for long.</v>

1149
00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1150
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Voltaire's biographer wasn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>

1151
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:48.510
<v Speaker 2>so if it was a lady hit rowdy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well one of the mini biographies of him </v>

1152
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.510
<v Speaker 2>in the Nineteen thirties came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that adage,</v>

1153
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 2>summarizing his views that I may </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with you,</v>

1154
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>but I'll defend to the death your right </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say it.</v>

1155
00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:02.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of things implicit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that seemed to be incredibly </v>

1156
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:02.700
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I may disagree with you,</v>

1157
00:58:02.701 --> 00:58:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but you have dignity and standing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth and a right to put your view.</v>

1158
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:13.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm respecting the other person or you </v>

1159
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.200
<v Speaker 2>should crave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1160
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.480
<v Speaker 2>and the second thing it implies is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea on the table that's important </v>

1161
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.891
<v Speaker 2>for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is we need to have a debate about </v>

1162
00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:21.891
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not attack the person who put it there,</v>

1163
00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:22.860
<v Speaker 2>show some respect for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is</v>

1164
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.420
<v Speaker 1>only bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost debate that you find the best way</v>

1165
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that then that ties </v>

1166
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.791
<v Speaker 1>back to the discussion we had about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of memory and the purpose of of </v>

1167
00:58:34.791 --> 00:58:34.791
<v Speaker 1>historical education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1168
00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:40.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a rule in my book which is rule </v>

1169
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.401
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that the person that you're </v>

1170
00:58:43.401 --> 00:58:43.401
<v Speaker 1>listening to know something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1171
00:58:43.401 --> 00:58:47.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do the person you're listening to </v>

1172
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:47.210
<v Speaker 1>know some things you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure of that.</v>

1173
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Now whether or not you can get to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a different matter,</v>

1174
00:58:49.411 --> 00:58:52.200
<v Speaker 1>but if you do get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real deal for you.</v>

1175
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person's argument says,</v>

1176
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're not everything you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1177
00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the pathway forward with </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much clarity as you could and it's </v>

1178
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.290
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the wonderful things that</v>

1179
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I've had the privilege of experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a clinician,</v>

1180
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>

1181
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like I live inside a Dostoyevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel as a clinician.</v>

1182
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:16.580
<v Speaker 1>People come in and they tell me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives and I listened to them and </v>

1183
00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.060
<v Speaker 1>they tell me things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely beyond belief,</v>

1184
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I learn from my clients constantly </v>

1185
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:26.970
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're telling me honestly about their </v>

1186
00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:28.931
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell me things they wouldn't tell </v>

1187
00:59:28.931 --> 00:59:28.931
<v Speaker 1>anyone else because I actually listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

1188
00:59:28.931 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason I listened is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm desperate to listen.</v>

1189
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a possibility I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do something stupid in the next</v>

1190
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.140
<v Speaker 1>five years that's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal.</v>

1191
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And there's some small possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a decent discussion that </v>

1192
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you'll tell me something that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate some of my blindness so that I</v>

1193
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 1>don't have to fall into that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitt.</v>

1194
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a good sensitivity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the depth of the pit,</v>

1195
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 1>then you know you're pretty bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to avoid it.</v>

1196
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that and that,</v>

1197
00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 1>that dialogue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1198
00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it's dialogic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Daya Logos,</v>

1199
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shared logos.</v>

1200
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the way that we redeem ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually moving forward,</v>

1201
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>have old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on having the facts on the </v>

1202
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially you're able to establish them</v>

1203
01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>not distortions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

1204
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>not what you wish would be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least your best approximation of what</v>

1205
01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you think to be true and not what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish for Helen,</v>

1206
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>because it never seems to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I disagree with what you say,</v>

1207
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painted as hate speech or challenging to</v>

1208
01:00:28.821 --> 01:00:33.821
<v Speaker 1>my notions of diversity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusiveness on all fought to the </v>

1209
01:00:33.821 --> 01:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your right to even have your say.</v>

1210
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why hate speech laws are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>pernicious.</v>

1211
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that needs to be taken apart.</v>

1212
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>First question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there such a thing as hate speech?</v>

1213
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people say terrible things,</v>

1214
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quasi criminal things even all the time.</v>

1215
01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them cause a lot of trouble.</v>

1216
01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that there's hateful speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1217
01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1218
01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that's self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

1219
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's regulate it.</v>

1220
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1221
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Because it's hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'd rather that there wasn't any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1223
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1224
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Who defines hate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1225
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll worry about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1226
01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't.</v>

1227
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the answer to who defines hate?</v>

1228
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Those people that you would least want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have defined it.</v>

1229
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>That will be the inevitable consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the legislation because sensible </v>

1230
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>people won't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1231
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Like people who are power mad will </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitate to that domain to make an </v>

1232
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>ethical case to exercise their </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling power over the language of </v>

1233
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>other people know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have had journalists say,</v>

1234
01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:46.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that you're right </v>

1235
01:01:46.841 --> 01:01:46.841
<v Speaker 1>to free speech?</v>

1236
01:01:46.841 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Trump's the right of someone to not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

1237
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's really the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our political discourse.</v>

1238
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll run a little thought </v>

1239
01:01:55.631 --> 01:01:55.631
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking to one person.</v>

1240
01:01:55.631 --> 01:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you and the rule is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get to offend you.</v>

1241
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can still have a discussion </v>

1242
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:04.421
<v Speaker 1>about something difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say I'm talking to 10 people </v>

1243
01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and about an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have to make sure that I don't say</v>

1244
01:02:06.861 --> 01:02:11.861
<v Speaker 1>anything to fight despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't important and contentious </v>

1245
01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.831
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't say anything that offends </v>

1246
01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:14.831
<v Speaker 1>even one of those 10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1247
01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:19.571
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can even manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I'm talking to a thousand </v>

1248
01:02:19.571 --> 01:02:22.481
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be somewhat in that </v>

1249
01:02:22.481 --> 01:02:25.731
<v Speaker 1>thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be someone who's </v>

1250
01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:27.771
<v Speaker 1>offended at the mere fact that I exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's an impossible standard.</v>

1251
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1252
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you can't say anything offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1253
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can't say anything.</v>

1254
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

1255
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to say anything because no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one should be offended.</v>

1256
01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Well then you don't get to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1257
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:46.701
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you can't negotiate your way </v>

1258
01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>through the future and you fall into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pit and so does everyone else.</v>

1259
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's where that all ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say offensive things equals </v>

1260
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you cannot negotiate your way properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the future equals everyone </v>

1261
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1262
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad strategy.</v>

1263
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all covered up with,</v>

1264
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1265
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Be better if no one was ever offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1266
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:18.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who thinks that you know how naive you </v>

1267
01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>have to be to think that how you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be pathologically naive,</v>

1268
01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>which is the kind of naive that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have grown out of,</v>

1269
01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but you willfully refused to because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't willing to see what was in front</v>

1270
01:03:28.991 --> 01:03:33.991
<v Speaker 1>of your face and then you impose that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind naivety on everyone else because </v>

1271
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to allow them to upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>your like rosy view,</v>

1272
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>your rosy view of yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1273
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's no end to how terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1274
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of our very astute writers </v>

1275
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 2>recently made the comment that freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of speech is the most important freedom </v>

1276
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:59.140
<v Speaker 2>because it's the freedom by which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend all about other freedoms.</v>

1277
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It strikes me that freedom of speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>though is most important,</v>

1278
01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.840
<v Speaker 2>not for the powerful of the elites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually for the minority groups.</v>

1279
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.870
<v Speaker 2>A free society surely is one that allows</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who swim against the tide and have</v>

1280
01:04:16.871 --> 01:04:21.871
<v Speaker 2>a different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right to do so without fear of mob </v>

1281
01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.770
<v Speaker 2>or state sanction.</v>

1282
01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1283
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you've had some personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>while I gave a talk and the University </v>

1284
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>of British Columbia about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called leftwing case for freedom </v>

1285
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.771
<v Speaker 1>of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really easy to make a </v>

1286
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:38.771
<v Speaker 1>left wing case for freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1287
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:39.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I dispossessed.</v>

1288
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:42.590
<v Speaker 1>How have the opportunity to make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering known,</v>

1289
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1291
01:04:44.811 --> 01:04:49.811
<v Speaker 1>it's the fact that that argument even </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be made shows you how </v>

1292
01:04:49.811 --> 01:04:54.491
<v Speaker 1>pathological the radical left has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's clearly the case that </v>

1293
01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech is not generally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interests of the power elite,</v>

1294
01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they already have access to,</v>

1295
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>to what they need to maintain their grip</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world.</v>

1296
01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at those in that manner,</v>

1297
01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:12.041
<v Speaker 1>it's the people at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy who's right to expression </v>

1298
01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.130
<v Speaker 1>needs to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in control of the debate,</v>

1299
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't need freedom of speech.</v>

1300
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously so it's useful for the </v>

1301
01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.071
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed of freedom of speech issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other issue that you wrote </v>

1302
01:05:23.071 --> 01:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>that the writer that you described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rope a rope,</v>

1303
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>brought to the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the idea of the hierarchy of rights.</v>

1304
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Now in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our conception of rights in Canada,</v>

1305
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>we're not willing to assume that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reit has priority over any other right </v>

1306
01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work out because when the </v>

1307
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>two rights come into conflict with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

1308
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:47.341
<v Speaker 1>which they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to adjudicate their relative </v>

1309
01:05:47.341 --> 01:05:49.981
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's happened in Canada is that </v>

1310
01:05:49.981 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>equality rights keep trumping everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else and that's not good.</v>

1311
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a good reason why you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have a bill of rights and we </v>

1312
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>never should have had one in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>

1313
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1314
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:00.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>

1315
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to freedom of speech is </v>

1316
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>central because it's the right by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you defend all the other rights.</v>

1317
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the idea of logos in the West</v>

1318
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>is the most sacred concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1319
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:13.540
<v Speaker 1>The cause of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about this psychologically,</v>

1320
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 1>is Christ is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ideal of perfection.</v>

1321
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the independent of any religious</v>

1322
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any historical accuracy.</v>

1323
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:25.861
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at this from the </v>

1324
01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:25.861
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the analysis of a myth or</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1325
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:28.990
<v Speaker 1>What Christ represents is the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1326
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1327
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you discussed endlessly what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things the West has </v>

1328
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.090
<v Speaker 1>settled on is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1329
01:06:36.091 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>that is that the perfect individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>otters,</v>

1330
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>the truthful speech that makes potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>into habitable order,</v>

1331
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:48.420
<v Speaker 1>does that through truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's embedded in the first few </v>

1332
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:48.420
<v Speaker 1>sentences in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in genesis,</v>

1333
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.000
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1334
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1335
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>when God brings the world into being so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and the idea that that truthful </v>

1336
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>speech that brings the world into being </v>
<v Speaker 1>from formulas,</v>

1337
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:59.140
<v Speaker 1>potential also characterize as each </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1338
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1339
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1340
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.560
<v Speaker 1>for our fabrication in the image of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of the West.</v>

1341
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:10.561
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably remarkable idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection individual perfection is to </v>

1342
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 1>be found in a relationship with spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1343
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.240
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1344
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1345
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's out of that arises the observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no,</v>

1346
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.900
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more central to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of rights and obligations as </v>

1347
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1348
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Then freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1349
01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:35.071
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Christ is the word made </v>

1350
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:38.731
<v Speaker 1>flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the perfect individual </v>

1351
01:07:38.731 --> 01:07:38.830
<v Speaker 1>is the person who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while who speaks truth,</v>

1352
01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but also acts out the truth of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

1353
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1354
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:49.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a proposition who's merit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually self evident when you </v>

1355
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 1>understand it in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1356
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I keep two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two c assaults on freedom of speech,</v>

1357
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>especially compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1358
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:56.860
<v Speaker 1>that's where I drew the line in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

1359
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It was like preps that's held speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation in Canada.</v>

1360
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps that's why the lift so </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined in this country to get </v>

1361
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Christianity out of the classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to lose something of the children.</v>

1362
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're determined.</v>

1363
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:13.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean people like Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he called the West Fowl logo </v>

1364
01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:13.981
<v Speaker 1>centric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1365
01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Male dominated logos centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that is the west.</v>

1366
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a logo centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to take the west down,</v>

1367
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you remove the idea of the divine word </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the substructure of the society,</v>

1368
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.700
<v Speaker 1>so you have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1369
01:08:26.701 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is the level at which this war </v>
<v Speaker 1>is being fought,</v>

1370
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamentally a theological war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1371
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a famous Waterloo lectures </v>

1372
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:42.430
<v Speaker 1>blaze Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inaugural Blaise Pascal lecture in </v>

1373
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>1978.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Malcolm Muggeridge,</v>

1374
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>said the waste was in danger of eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out from within.</v>

1375
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And he spoke at great length about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to,</v>

1376
01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how the West was abandoned in </v>

1377
01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:00.641
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and it'll become a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>empty and soulless and financially </v>

1378
01:09:00.641 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt places a result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wouldn't be the end.</v>

1379
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.440
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the attempts to kill it in </v>

1380
01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.991
<v Speaker 1>places like communist China and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will always be people who will </v>

1381
01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>fight through to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1382
01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>we can see now three decades own </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1383
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that he was absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to four decades.</v>

1384
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:21.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1385
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Christianity is spreading faster in</v>

1386
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:28.421
<v Speaker 1>communist China than it did in Rome </v>
<v Speaker 1>during its most rapid period of </v>

1387
01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>expansion in terms of proportion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people transforming.</v>

1388
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.270
<v Speaker 1>So Christianity is spreading incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly in China,</v>

1389
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>which is who would have guessed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1390
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1391
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just makes you,</v>

1392
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.830
<v Speaker 1>makes you shake your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us a little more about your Chilean</v>

1393
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:40.360
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1394
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean Canada and Australia culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>

1395
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:47.441
<v Speaker 1>very like if it can happen in in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably he's coming here.</v>

1396
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how it's going to happen here.</v>

1397
01:09:49.071 --> 01:09:54.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a move from where </v>

1398
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:59.081
<v Speaker 1>you're already at and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the quantas airline thing is a </v>

1399
01:09:59.081 --> 01:09:59.600
<v Speaker 1>really good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that these things are happening</v>

1400
01:09:59.601 --> 01:10:04.601
<v Speaker 1>and that corporations aren't standing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in outrage against the introduction of </v>

1401
01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:08.501
<v Speaker 1>ideas like equity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you guys are all primed for </v>

1402
01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:08.501
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not compelled speech?</v>

1403
01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's done for the best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all possible reasons.</v>

1404
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I was accused of denying the identities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the oppressed.</v>

1405
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1406
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.020
<v Speaker 1>for me that wasn't the issue at all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1407
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.800
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

1408
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:20.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1409
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an advocate of hate speech laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the reasons I've already described.</v>

1410
01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like who's going to define hate?</v>

1411
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Not In the people you want to define it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1412
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad enough,</v>

1413
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 1>but then to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1414
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I have to use the language of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>detestable radical leftists,</v>

1415
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.230
<v Speaker 1>leftists photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that's not happening,</v>

1416
01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I said,</v>

1417
01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:48.731
<v Speaker 1>so you go videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most wonderful Australians </v>

1418
01:10:48.731 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>on our corporate leaders and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generous philanthropic,</v>

1419
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>they thoughtful they're contributors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the public debate,</v>

1420
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.580
<v Speaker 1>but I'd have to say far too many of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem,</v>

1421
01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll use the expression piggy ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reality that they are playing </v>

1422
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:04.211
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're playing with cultural forces </v>

1423
01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>that will destroy the very activities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would hold up as being central</v>

1424
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 1>to our wealth and prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cultural forces are playing with </v>

1425
01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1426
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are astute people can't </v>

1427
01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.191
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see there being toyed with there </v>

1428
01:11:22.191 --> 01:11:22.191
<v Speaker 1>being toyed with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1429
01:11:22.191 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with demonic forces in a sense.</v>

1430
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that in a psychological sense,</v>

1431
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have ideas.</v>

1432
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Ideas have people just like you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that for about five years.</v>

1433
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1434
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:43.310
<v Speaker 1>if you take the typical student radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their demonstration and you have </v>

1435
01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>a chat with them one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out that,</v>

1436
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the daughter of the guy down the</v>

1437
01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>street that you wave to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:55.610
<v Speaker 1>while she was growing up and that 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of her is sensible person,</v>

1439
01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 10 percent is resentful and 10 </v>

1440
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 1>percent is ideologically possessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the machinations of or</v>

1441
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:08.450
<v Speaker 1>idiot professors and so she's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get 10 of her together and </v>

1442
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:14.391
<v Speaker 1>each of them are 10 percent possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have the whole devil in the </v>

1443
01:12:14.391 --> 01:12:14.391
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1444
01:12:14.391 --> 01:12:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thing has a will.</v>

1445
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It has a historical will and you better </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be thinking you're running the show,</v>

1446
01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.080
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're ignorant of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and the corporate types who are </v>

1447
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.801
<v Speaker 1>letting the radical left fifth column </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their midst and mostly through </v>

1448
01:12:30.801 --> 01:12:33.150
<v Speaker 1>their human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their human resources departments,</v>

1449
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 1>which would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should probably just be shut down.</v>

1450
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what they're missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they should watch,</v>

1451
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:45.290
<v Speaker 1>what happens to google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to say I've been pretty </v>

1452
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:48.231
<v Speaker 1>stunned by two or three of the senior </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman in this country who have said </v>

1453
01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:51.771
<v Speaker 1>to me or said to friends of mine in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of recent politically correct </v>

1454
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:56.261
<v Speaker 1>the bites here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd been startled themselves by </v>

1455
01:12:56.261 --> 01:12:59.961
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The companies underneath of them have </v>

1456
01:12:59.961 --> 01:13:03.531
<v Speaker 1>said [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which raises some interesting questions </v>

1457
01:13:03.531 --> 01:13:05.040
<v Speaker 1>about they need to get up to speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not startled enough.</v>

1458
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So I've watched.</v>

1459
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many people have sent me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of training programs,</v>

1460
01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but the diversity consultants are </v>
<v Speaker 1>foisting on the corporate world.</v>

1461
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1462
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440
<v Speaker 1>it's as if a woman's studies program has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been placed in the midst of the </v>

1463
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 1>corporate environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

1464
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only the academic left,</v>

1465
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

1466
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 1>made manifest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a powerpoint presentation.</v>

1467
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst elements of the activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Academically.</v>

1468
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:38.330
<v Speaker 1>The most appalling parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university are making themselves </v>

1469
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.721
<v Speaker 1>manifest in the corporate world at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing rate and the corporations are </v>

1470
01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:43.050
<v Speaker 1>guilty partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1471
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:48.110
<v Speaker 1>partly because of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say they're guilty and they </v>

1472
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.961
<v Speaker 1>wanted wallpaper over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad Conscience with with some hand </v>

1473
01:13:50.961 --> 01:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>waving to to the equality pushers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1474
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:56.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with that at your peril.</v>

1475
01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diversity,</v>

1476
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity.</v>

1477
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad game if you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned,</v>

1478
01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>if you play it and in ways you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

1479
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Already.</v>

1480
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Freedom Fan was respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debate</v>

1481
01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:14.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1482
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>

1483
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.080
<v Speaker 2>that is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's circle back to young people </v>

1484
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>because the future is going to belong to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them before we know it.</v>

1485
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.700
<v Speaker 2>A remarkable and very insightful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging human being.</v>

1486
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Heit is perhaps a lad in </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1487
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>of somebody who's seen from a left </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective himself had dangerous all of</v>

1488
01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:48.001
<v Speaker 2>his ears on how we're endangering young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people by not being honest with them,</v>

1489
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.720
<v Speaker 2>not encouraging them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explore what they instinctively feel </v>

1490
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.921
<v Speaker 2>needs to be explored going back to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier topic and when leaving them </v>

1491
01:14:58.921 --> 01:15:03.391
<v Speaker 2>without the resilience that they going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to need to confirm if you like a free </v>

1492
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.300
<v Speaker 2>and prosperous society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1493
01:15:08.301 --> 01:15:09.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a Christian,</v>

1494
01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:12.400
<v Speaker 2>he run relating to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'd just like to read,</v>

1495
01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his piece,</v>

1496
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 2>the coddling of the American mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Heit outlines why millennials </v>

1497
01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:24.901
<v Speaker 2>today are so fragile and lacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>resilience in life and in relationships </v>

1498
01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:31.130
<v Speaker 2>in university courses in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what has led to this overwhelming </v>

1499
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:34.210
<v Speaker 2>push to be protected from anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult or uncomfortable or offensive.</v>

1500
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And he calls it the flight to safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you've used that expression,</v>

1501
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he outlines the core reason for this </v>

1502
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:47.941
<v Speaker 2>fragility of mind and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says it stems firstly from </v>

1503
01:15:47.941 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 2>overfunctioning and over protective </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

1504
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Then schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now Richard's into our university just </v>

1505
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 2>because more people than ever go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities in the waste.</v>

1506
01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.360
<v Speaker 2>So they formed a much bigger bulk in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>community afterwards and it leaves them </v>

1507
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.220
<v Speaker 2>tragically unprepared and unarmed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and relationships.</v>

1508
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Would you comment on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to take a step back </v>

1509
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:11.590
<v Speaker 2>from that and think about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadest possible terms.</v>

1510
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:16.330
<v Speaker 2>There is definitely an epidemic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>overprotective parenting,</v>

1511
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's useful to ask why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my suspicions are,</v>

1512
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 2>is that this is driven by very </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>

1513
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:30.480
<v Speaker 2>biological and cultural phenomena that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't generally considered in </v>

1514
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:30.480
<v Speaker 2>relationship to this issue.</v>

1515
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.380
<v Speaker 1>We don't have very many children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have</v>

1516
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.720
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1517
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.650
<v Speaker 2>six of who die.</v>

1518
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:43.150
<v Speaker 1>We have one or two</v>

1519
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:46.310
<v Speaker 2>and that makes them very precious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1520
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.040
<v Speaker 2>We're unwilling to take risks with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no wonder.</v>

1521
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And then we also have the much later in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1522
01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.490
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you have a kid when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 18,</v>

1523
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you're still a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna go out and have your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1525
01:17:00.201 --> 01:17:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Because you're so while you're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the height of your exploratory,</v>

1526
01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the height of the exploratory </v>

1527
01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:10.780
<v Speaker 2>part of your life.</v>

1528
01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.280
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to overprotect your kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're still a kid.</v>

1529
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:18.910
<v Speaker 1>But if you're 40 and you have one child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like all your eggs are in one </v>

1530
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:20.930
<v Speaker 1>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the probability that you're going to</v>

1531
01:17:20.931 --> 01:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>take undue risks with that precious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is very,</v>

1532
01:17:24.621 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously there's some advantages to</v>

1533
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:31.871
<v Speaker 1>that because great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would devote resources to your </v>

1534
01:17:31.871 --> 01:17:31.871
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1535
01:17:31.871 --> 01:17:34.961
<v Speaker 1>and foster their development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the downside is that you have every </v>

1536
01:17:34.961 --> 01:17:39.341
<v Speaker 1>motivation to hover and maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>also extraordinarily desperate as a </v>

1537
01:17:39.341 --> 01:17:44.171
<v Speaker 1>mother to maintain that bond with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child because you struggled so long to </v>

1538
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:47.030
<v Speaker 1>achieve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highly,</v>

1539
01:17:47.031 --> 01:17:50.210
<v Speaker 1>highly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't take a risk well.</v>

1540
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 1>So these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we might say,</v>

1541
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:57.671
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps over protective parenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a secondary and unintended </v>

1542
01:17:57.671 --> 01:18:00.911
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that people now have </v>

1543
01:18:00.911 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>children later in life could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1544
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:03.140
<v Speaker 1>if you have six kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1545
01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:03.440
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna?</v>

1546
01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Do a helicopter parent them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1547
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so tired.</v>

1548
01:18:07.701 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get off the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have six kids and they're.</v>

1549
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 1>They outnumber you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1550
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:17.291
<v Speaker 1>They're raising each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're competing and they're taking </v>

1551
01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:17.291
<v Speaker 1>each other down a peg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1552
01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:21.490
<v Speaker 1>There's no overprotection there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a single child landscape or </v>

1553
01:18:21.711 --> 01:18:25.400
<v Speaker 1>dual child landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly a single child landscape.</v>

1554
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to overprotect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that ethos starts to permeate the </v>

1555
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:35.111
<v Speaker 1>schools and it starts to permeate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education institutions as those </v>

1556
01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 1>children mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that all reinforces it.</v>

1557
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious what to do about it </v>

1558
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.221
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it is driven by demographics </v>

1559
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:45.221
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that sense,</v>

1560
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more intractable problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we think.</v>

1561
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some of that in 12 rules for life,</v>

1562
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1563
01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:54.701
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to understand is that </v>

1564
01:18:54.701 --> 01:18:54.701
<v Speaker 1>you're a danger to your children no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>

1565
01:18:54.701 --> 01:18:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can let them go out into the world </v>

1566
01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and be hurt or you can overprotect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hurt them that way.</v>

1567
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your choice.</v>

1568
01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 1>You can make your children competent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous or you can make them safe,</v>

1569
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 1>but you can't make them safe because </v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't safe.</v>

1570
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you sacrifice their courage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence on the altar of safety,</v>

1571
01:19:15.891 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 1>then you disarmed them completely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all they can do is pray to be protected.</v>

1572
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 1>That's so in the very act of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing by them.</v>

1573
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Although often with a selfish motive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right off roading,</v>

1574
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:34.930
<v Speaker 1>we scrip why the tools and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

1575
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the understanding they really need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make life work.</v>

1576
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

1577
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the diploma mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1578
01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 1>That was Freud's great discovery of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark mother.</v>

1579
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 1>The dark mother is the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the witch in Hansel and Gretel.</v>

1580
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Gingerbread house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lost Children.</v>

1581
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to be true.</v>

1582
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like a house of candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1583
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Who could want anything better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What lives inside the House of Candy,</v>

1584
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the which that wants to fatten you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat you.</v>

1585
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cautionary tale about over protective </v>

1586
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.410
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over protective mothers about the over </v>

1587
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>protective feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the psychoanalysts.</v>

1588
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:17.271
<v Speaker 1>They were so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said the good mother necessarily fails </v>

1589
01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>at such a brilliant phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't.</v>

1590
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 1>As you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as your child matures,</v>

1591
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to fail more and more as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

1592
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:27.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until by the time you're 30,</v>

1593
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>you're your child's 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 25 for that matter.</v>

1594
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not their mother anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you are,</v>

1595
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but the relationship has hit something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like quasi peer status,</v>

1596
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.400
<v Speaker 1>not entirely obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the child's independent able to </v>

1597
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>stand up on their own two feet and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world.</v>

1598
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Now we say the university student runs </v>
<v Speaker 2>into some difficulties with study or </v>

1599
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:52.971
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brings a parents in to talk to the </v>

1600
01:20:52.971 --> 01:20:52.971
<v Speaker 2>faculty.</v>

1601
01:20:52.971 --> 01:20:52.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they go off in color,</v>

1602
01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I went to Queens University </v>
<v Speaker 1>a week ago and there was a lot of noise </v>

1603
01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.650
<v Speaker 1>and and horror around that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:21:00.651 --> 01:21:05.651
<v Speaker 1>that the people who were decrying my </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit set up coloring book stations so </v>

1605
01:21:05.651 --> 01:21:06.980
<v Speaker 1>that people could be comforted because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1606
01:21:06.981 --> 01:21:09.740
<v Speaker 1>the evil professor was coming to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1607
01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a clinician and height knows this as </v>

1608
01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the clinicians worth their salt.</v>

1609
01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1610
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing you can do for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's anxious is overprotect them.</v>

1611
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It makes them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clinical literature on that is </v>

1612
01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:28.691
<v Speaker 1>crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do for people who are hyper </v>

1613
01:21:28.691 --> 01:21:31.481
<v Speaker 1>anxious is gradually expose them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their voluntary consent to increasingly </v>

1614
01:21:33.081 --> 01:21:38.081
<v Speaker 1>threatening situations that cures them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite of what all </v>

1615
01:21:38.081 --> 01:21:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the mental health professionals so and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>use that term extraordinarily lightly,</v>

1616
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.980
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do to produce safe spaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the university campus.</v>

1617
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if as safe as a space needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined as safe,</v>

1618
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that's the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not.</v>

1619
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been fascinating.</v>

1620
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Let me pay you a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some ways,</v>

1621
01:22:00.171 --> 01:22:05.171
<v Speaker 2>I think the most valuable thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do for us is to model the courage to </v>

1622
01:22:05.571 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 2>speak your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it forcefully,</v>

1623
01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you do it courageously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it compassionately because the </v>

1624
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.951
<v Speaker 2>reality is you only have to spend a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time with you to realize that you </v>

1625
01:22:17.951 --> 01:22:22.181
<v Speaker 2>actually care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially about our young people and </v>

1626
01:22:22.181 --> 01:22:25.571
<v Speaker 2>what they're experiencing and especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our young men because we know boys </v>

1627
01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:30.670
<v Speaker 2>model themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all men who they respect you.</v>

1628
01:22:33.201 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Speaker 2>They are a great job of modeling</v>

1629
01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.440
<v Speaker 1>in the face of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1630
01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:39.830
<v Speaker 1>there's something I like to say maybe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>closing about courage.</v>

1631
01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:43.340
<v Speaker 1>People say that to me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's exactly right.</v>

1632
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.620
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a line in the old testament.</v>

1633
01:22:45.621 --> 01:22:49.070
<v Speaker 1>The fear of God is the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and I think it's more like that.</v>

1634
01:22:49.071 --> 01:22:54.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I'm courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that I'm afraid of the right </v>

1635
01:22:54.071 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I made my videos,</v>

1636
01:22:55.051 --> 01:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like that didn't make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

1637
01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.620
<v Speaker 1>but I was less nervous about going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bed and not saying what I had to say </v>

1638
01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>that I was about making the videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know where this is going,</v>

1639
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not so much courage.</v>

1640
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It's that it's a matter of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1641
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less risky to say something than to</v>

1642
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>remain silent when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said.</v>

1643
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I know that to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so lots of times in life it's like </v>

1644
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no pathway forward that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shield you from risk.</v>

1645
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick this risk or you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick this risk.</v>

1646
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think I picked the lesser risk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be wise,</v>

1647
01:23:35.381 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure it's courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1648
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's leave it on that basis.</v>

1649
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1650
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
