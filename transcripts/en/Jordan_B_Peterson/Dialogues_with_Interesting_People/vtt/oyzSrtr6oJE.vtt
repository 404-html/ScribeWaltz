1
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking today with Dr Steven Hicks,</v>

2
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>who's a professor of philosophy at in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Department of Philosophy at Rockford</v>

3
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>University in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Professor Hicks has written a book </v>

4
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that I found several books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's written one in particular that </v>

5
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.741
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to him about today called</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining postmodernism skepticism and </v>

6
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>socialism for Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to food code,</v>

7
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>which was published fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it fair while ago now in 2004,</v>

8
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think has become even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pertinent and relevant today.</v>

9
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And I have talked a lot to my viewers </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your book and so let's talk about </v>

10
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and its relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>new Marxism.</v>

11
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>That's an so maybe you could tell our </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers here a little bit more about </v>

12
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>yourself and how you got interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

13
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

14
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 2>finished graduate school in philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early nineties.</v>

15
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm originally from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born in Toronto.</v>

16
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point a Pittsburgh and Indiana </v>

17
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 2>had the two strongest philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and logic programs.</v>

18
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I was interested in at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

19
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:35.771
<v Speaker 2>So on a professor recommendation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up at Indiana and it worked out </v>

20
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 2>very nicely for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of my graduate work was actually</v>

21
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 2>in epistemology philosophy of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>

22
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>some cognitive science issues as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the ecosystem,</v>

23
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people and philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic issues that come up being </v>

24
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:58.091
<v Speaker 2>the groundwork was laid for that when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>finished Grad school teaching full time,</v>

26
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to rutgers university is teaching </v>

27
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 2>an honors program and the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>program worked,</v>

28
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 2>it was essentially a great books </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

29
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 2>So it was like getting a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>education wonderfully.</v>

30
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>the way it was done was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each course was taught by two professors</v>

32
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:21.011
<v Speaker 2>to our honor students and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors would be from different </v>

33
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 2>departments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so paired with literature,</v>

34
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 2>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history professors and so on.</v>

35
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And this was now the middle of nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to hear about to thinkers.</v>

36
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I had not read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of heard about them,</v>

37
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 2>but now I was reading them more closely </v>
<v Speaker 2>and finding that in history,</v>

38
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:42.851
<v Speaker 2>in literature and sociology and pro a </v>
<v Speaker 2>names like dairy dog who the others were</v>

39
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 2>not omnipresent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were huge names.</v>

40
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So I realized I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a gap in my education to fill.</v>

41
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>So start reading a deeply in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 2>my education in some ways was a broad in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of philosophy but narrow at </v>

43
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>the graduate school level than I focused</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly on annual American philosophy.</v>

44
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So my understanding of the continental </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions was quite limited,</v>

45
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but by the time I got to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

46
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized there was something </v>

47
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.701
<v Speaker 2>significant going on coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>continental philosophy and that's where </v>

48
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 2>the book came out.</v>

49
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.390
<v Speaker 1>When you say significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mean what do you mean by that?</v>

50
00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Speaker 1>You mean intellectually do you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially?</v>

51
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:33.581
<v Speaker 1>Politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different variants of </v>

52
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:33.581
<v Speaker 1>significant</v>

53
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.880
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually this is still the 1990,</v>

54
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so postmodernism was not yet outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>say are a,</v>

55
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.580
<v Speaker 2>a cultural wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was strongly an intellectual </v>

56
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.301
<v Speaker 2>force in that at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young phds coming out of sociology,</v>

57
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>a literary criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some subdisciplines in the law,</v>

58
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 2>you're getting paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in the law,</v>

59
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 2>historiography and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly in a departments in </v>

60
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 2>philosophy still dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>continental,</v>

61
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 2>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provocative,</v>

62
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that almost all of them are primarily </v>

63
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.351
<v Speaker 2>being schooled in what we now call </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern thinkers.</v>

64
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 2>So the leading gurus are people like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>leotard from whom we get the label,</v>

65
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 2>postmodern condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuko and,</v>

66
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 2>and the others.</v>

67
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could walk us through what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn because people are unfamiliar.</v>

68
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>

69
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were advanced in your education,</v>

70
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>including in philosophy and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized your ignorance say with </v>

71
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:46.891
<v Speaker 1>regards to postmodern thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's obviously a condition </v>

72
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that's shared by a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and postmodernism is one of those</v>

73
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>words like existentialism that covers an</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of territory and sober.</v>

74
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we could zero in on exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means and who these thinkers were,</v>

75
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gluco,</v>

76
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>and who you are and what you learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

77
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

79
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the things you just named,</v>

80
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 2>they think broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think strategically and they do </v>

81
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.471
<v Speaker 2>have a very strong historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on their disciplines and at </v>

82
00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 2>the same time they are trying to assess </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they think we are culturally,</v>

83
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

84
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.050
<v Speaker 2>and all of them are making a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:27.051
<v Speaker 2>dramatic claim that to some extent or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way modernism has either ended or </v>

86
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 2>it has reached its major right or all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the pack,</v>

87
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>apologies and negative traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

88
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 2>within the modern world are reaching a </v>
<v Speaker 2>culmination in their generation.</v>

89
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.900
<v Speaker 2>And so it's time for us to both </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that modernism has come to an </v>

90
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.761
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need some sort of new </v>

91
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:55.191
<v Speaker 2>intellectual framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A post modern framework isn't</v>

92
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.970
<v Speaker 1>that they're criticizing what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you carry that?</v>

93
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the enlightenment values.</v>

94
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>That's scientific rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you characterize it?</v>

95
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elements of it.</v>

96
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 2>So of course there are some discipline </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific differences.</v>

97
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 2>So literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in philosophy,</v>

98
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>people and the historians will use </v>
<v Speaker 2>modernism slightly differently.</v>

99
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.790
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of core is that if you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the mortem world,</v>

100
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 2>essentially the world of the Middle Ages</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that that was a itself broken up </v>

101
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:34.421
<v Speaker 2>by a series of revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the renaissance reformation and counter </v>

102
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:38.281
<v Speaker 2>reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early scientific revolutions and all of </v>

103
00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 2>this is going on in a historic or short </v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks of time.</v>

104
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>15 hundreds and 16 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you look at the both the </v>

105
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.200
<v Speaker 2>intellectual world and the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 2>comparing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the 14 hundreds with the 17 hundreds</v>

107
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>culturally and intellectually you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different universe actually at that </v>

108
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the features then of the,</v>

109
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 2>of the modern world.</v>

110
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm going to use my </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical labels here are that we're</v>

111
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 2>now natural listing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in our thinking that we were no </v>

112
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 2>longer primarily supernatural mistake in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our thinking.</v>

113
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So we might still be open to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a god or some sort of </v>

114
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 2>supernatural dimension like the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>deists are.</v>

115
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>But first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taking the natural world as a more</v>

116
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:29.021
<v Speaker 2>or less self contained self governing </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that operate supporting the cause </v>

117
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:33.821
<v Speaker 2>and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to study it and its </v>

118
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.101
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not seeing the natural world </v>

119
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:36.101
<v Speaker 2>as a derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

120
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:40.961
<v Speaker 2>Have a higher world or that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens in the natural world is a </v>

121
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 2>part of God's plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we read omens and so forth into </v>

122
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.301
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So metaphysically then where there's </v>

123
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:52.120
<v Speaker 2>been a revolution will naturalistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>epistemologically in terms of knowledge.</v>

124
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:57.311
<v Speaker 2>There also has been a revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a how do we know the important truths </v>

125
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.890
<v Speaker 2>that require the beliefs that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally going to commit our lives </v>

126
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 2>to four by the time we become modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

127
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take experience seriously personal </v>

128
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

129
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>We do that more rigorously and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing and scientific method,</v>

130
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 2>the way of organizing the data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're taking logic and all of the </v>

131
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.061
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated tools of rationality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing those increasingly.</v>

132
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 2>And so our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

133
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:28.291
<v Speaker 2>our opposition then is either you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something because you can experience it </v>

134
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:31.961
<v Speaker 2>and verify it for yourself or we've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard work of scientific method a and</v>

135
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:38.261
<v Speaker 2>as a result of what comes out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we can call knowledge or </v>

136
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>best approximation to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So revolutionary.</v>

137
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say one more thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prior intellectual framework,</v>

138
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:50.921
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was much more intellectually </v>

139
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian in the framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

140
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>So you would accept in the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition the authority of the church,</v>

141
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.190
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who are you to question the </v>

142
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.691
<v Speaker 2>authority of the church and who are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mount empirical rational arguments </v>

143
00:09:02.691 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>are against the authority of the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you take the authority of scripture,</v>

144
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you accept on faith that you've had a</v>

145
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.301
<v Speaker 2>mystical revelation of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in all of those cases you have non </v>

146
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:18.681
<v Speaker 2>rational epistemologies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominating intellectual discourse that </v>

147
00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>is all buying logs swept away by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

148
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 2>in the modern world.</v>

149
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

150
00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:26.500
<v Speaker 1>so prior to the emergence of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

151
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.540
<v Speaker 1>in the same people are dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially by their willingness to </v>

152
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.091
<v Speaker 1>adhere to a shared tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now shared tradition is somewhat </v>

153
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical enforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no real alternative in terms</v>

154
00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:39.130
<v Speaker 1>of epistemology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

155
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And then as the modern world emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people discovered the technologies of </v>

156
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.171
<v Speaker 1>science and the value of rigorously </v>
<v Speaker 1>applied method and the comparison of </v>

157
00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:52.960
<v Speaker 1>shared experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes us technologically,</v>

158
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful and in a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and philosophically different from </v>

159
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.540
<v Speaker 1>what we were before.</v>

160
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assured tradition praise that,</v>

161
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:02.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you added there,</v>

162
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:07.721
<v Speaker 2>that's an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say in the early modern </v>

163
00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:10.421
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not necessarily a skepticism </v>

164
00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:12.551
<v Speaker 2>about assured traditions of students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it would be an acceptance of shared </v>

165
00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:15.970
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that you would not </v>

166
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.020
<v Speaker 2>uncritically accept your tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will accept the tradition,</v>

167
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:23.021
<v Speaker 2>but only have two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've thought it through the major own </v>

168
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:23.021
<v Speaker 2>Independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

169
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:26.930
<v Speaker 1>So you're elevated to the status of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's capable of taking a stance</v>

170
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:29.960
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the tradition and assessing.</v>

171
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:34.961
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an elevation of the </v>

172
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:37.160
<v Speaker 1>individual and the critical intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone along with the,</v>

173
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>with the elaboration of the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>

174
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then then we might know perhaps that </v>

175
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a tremendously effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

176
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.400
<v Speaker 1>although maybe it leads in a somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic direction.</v>

177
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Metaphysically we can leave that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

178
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very successful revolution because by </v>

179
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.231
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the beginning of the 20th </v>

180
00:10:59.231 --> 00:10:59.270
<v Speaker 1>century comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this staggering.</v>

181
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

182
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.220
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this staggering transformation </v>

183
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.011
<v Speaker 1>of technology and technological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual power and then a stunning </v>

184
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:14.621
<v Speaker 1>increase in the standard of living and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that starts at about 1890 to really to </v>

185
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>move exponentially in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

186
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least to get to the really,</v>

187
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.100
<v Speaker 1>really steep part of the exit ex </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential curve.</v>

188
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems to be going well.</v>

189
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:27.110
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that the postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 1>are objecting to?</v>

190
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Precisely?</v>

191
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time,</v>

192
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.000
<v Speaker 2>just on those two issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

193
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.300
<v Speaker 2>the metaphysical naturalism and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

194
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:40.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elevation of critical empiricists </v>

195
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and a belief that we can through science</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

196
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even not necessarily a science,</v>

197
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.440
<v Speaker 2>the social scientists and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to understand powerful general </v>

198
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>principles about humanity and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

199
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Those two revolutions both are then </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjected to counter attacks.</v>

200
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

201
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens in this case is there was a</v>

202
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 2>probably by the time we get to 1800,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the height of the enlightenment or the </v>

204
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.741
<v Speaker 2>beginnings of more powerful skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions that they come to be </v>

205
00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:20.751
<v Speaker 2>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thinkers are starting to say </v>

206
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:20.751
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:24.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a scientific method is based on the </v>

208
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.110
<v Speaker 2>evidence of the senses that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 2>we observed the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our first point of contact,</v>

210
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.190
<v Speaker 2>and then on the basis of that reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have distractions and we put those apps </v>

211
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.830
<v Speaker 2>integrated into a propositions and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we take a propositions and put them in </v>

212
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 2>networks that we call theories and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

213
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So we start to critically examine each </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the elements of scientific method and</v>

214
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.000
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

215
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.040
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses in the existing accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how all of those rational operations </v>

216
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.540
<v Speaker 2>work come to be teased out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And philosophy then starts to go down a </v>

217
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 2>more skeptical path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

218
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take perception,</v>

219
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fundamental as our,</v>

220
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual subjects,</v>

221
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 2>first point of contact with the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

222
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.570
<v Speaker 2>then you have to immediately deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of a perceptual illusions for the</v>

223
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:22.021
<v Speaker 2>possibility that people will have </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinations or that the way you </v>

224
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:27.361
<v Speaker 2>report your perceptual experience is at </v>
<v Speaker 2>odds with how I report my perceptual </v>

225
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have all</v>

226
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.630
<v Speaker 1>tell me if I've got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with the dawning of the empirical </v>

227
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's this idea that you can</v>

228
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:41.690
<v Speaker 1>derive valid information from sensor </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

229
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.920
<v Speaker 1>especially if you contrast that sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>data rigorously without others.</v>

230
00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the foundation for the</v>

231
00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:52.931
<v Speaker 1>scientific method in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I think this is with manual </v>

232
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:53.270
<v Speaker 1>con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an objection to that,</v>

233
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>which is that while you can't make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that that sense data </v>

234
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>enters your cognitive apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your apparatus of understanding without </v>

235
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.481
<v Speaker 1>a prior restructuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's where the </v>

236
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.160
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists really go after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modernists.</v>

237
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:13.161
<v Speaker 1>It's that given that you have to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very complex perceptual structure that</v>

238
00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:18.401
<v Speaker 1>modern people might say was instantiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of biological </v>

239
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:19.640
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make the case that what you're</v>

240
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 1>receiving from the external world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like peer information.</v>

241
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's always subject to some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to delimit degree to </v>

242
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to take into </v>

243
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.301
<v Speaker 1>account the fact that about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>restructure and what it might mean for </v>

244
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:39.620
<v Speaker 1>your concept of objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's con.</v>

245
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I think if I've got that right.</v>

246
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmoderns,</v>

247
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.810
<v Speaker 2>we'll use both of those strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

248
00:14:44.811 --> 00:14:49.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strategy and the rationalist </v>

249
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:53.290
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's important about con right is </v>

250
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:53.290
<v Speaker 2>that cloud is integrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

251
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Both of those and by strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the generations before Khan,</v>

252
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>the skeptical arguments about perception</v>
<v Speaker 2>by directed against the empiricists,</v>

254
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you just want to say everything is based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on observational data,</v>

255
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but then if you don't have good answers </v>
<v Speaker 2>about hallucinations and relativity and </v>

256
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.080
<v Speaker 2>illusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

257
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 2>and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems like your structure,</v>

258
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.990
<v Speaker 2>intellectual structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it comes to be,</v>

259
00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:20.991
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all based on probabilistic or </v>

260
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:21.790
<v Speaker 2>possibly faulty perceptual data than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is a,</v>

261
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 2>is a tottering mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the time we get to con,</v>

262
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.560
<v Speaker 2>the appearance is tradition is a largely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unable to respond to those kinds of </v>

263
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 2>objections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so contract recognizing and saying,</v>

264
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.751
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been trying now for a couple of </v>

265
00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't been able to do so </v>

266
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 2>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be able to do so.</v>

268
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also nicely right,</v>

269
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.760
<v Speaker 2>emphasize that one of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other response.</v>

270
00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 2>So it had been on the rationalist solid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say,</v>

271
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

272
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't start with pure empirical data</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead that we do have perhaps some </v>

273
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 2>innate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a priori structures built into the human</v>

274
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they got there.</v>

275
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're put there by God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're put there naturalistically</v>

276
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 2>regular or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

277
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 2>but what enables us to have legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

278
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:15.761
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that our empirical data comes in and </v>

279
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>it is filtered and structured by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>preexisting right cognitive structures </v>

280
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.820
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that side of the line,</v>

281
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 2>and this is also well worked out by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time we get to the content,</v>

282
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:32.171
<v Speaker 2>is the same world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're starting with inbuilt </v>

283
00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:34.220
<v Speaker 2>cognitive structures and everything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in so to speak,</v>

284
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 2>goes through the structural machine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of the outputs.</v>

285
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.880
<v Speaker 2>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's presented to your mind.</v>

286
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know that those inbuilt </v>

287
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 2>structures I have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way reality actually is out there.</v>

288
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>

289
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:54.911
<v Speaker 2>What you are stuck with is the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of a subjective processing and </v>

290
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.070
<v Speaker 2>there is no way for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

291
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:03.071
<v Speaker 2>to jump outside of your head or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>compare it to end result with the way </v>

292
00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:07.181
<v Speaker 2>the world actually is our independently </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how your mind has structured the </v>

293
00:17:07.181 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 2>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once again,</v>

294
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you're struck stuck rather in a rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective place and again,</v>

295
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:17.561
<v Speaker 2>the importance of contours and he's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at this more rationalist </v>

296
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 2>tradition and he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look again,</v>

297
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:22.991
<v Speaker 2>we've been trying now for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries to work these things out here </v>

298
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:26.110
<v Speaker 2>from descartes who spinosa lightness in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the others and rationalism also has </v>

299
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>reached a dead end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not going to be able to do so.</v>

300
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.460
<v Speaker 2>So conference in effect standing at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of these two traditions and saying,</v>

301
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

302
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>the skeptics have it right on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>

303
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 2>The empiricists and the rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition fail.</v>

304
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.750
<v Speaker 2>There is no way for us to objectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to know and external reality </v>

305
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 2>restructuring some sort of subjectivism.</v>

306
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know now whether to talk a </v>

307
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.211
<v Speaker 1>little bit of Rote American pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to that or whether to maybe we </v>

308
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:02.321
<v Speaker 1>should go ahead and continue our </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the postmodernist because </v>

309
00:18:02.321 --> 00:18:02.900
<v Speaker 1>they're developing these claims.</v>

310
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the postmodernists who </v>

311
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:08.870
<v Speaker 2>describe themselves as neo pragmatist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Horton for example.</v>

312
00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:13.871
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the direction it's worth </v>

313
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:13.871
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

314
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:13.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my understanding of that,</v>

316
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.760
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to defend the modernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

317
00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:21.770
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that we,</v>

318
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:27.250
<v Speaker 1>we have instantiated within us an a </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority perceptual structure that's a </v>

319
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.901
<v Speaker 1>consequence of millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of years for that matter of </v>

320
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.170
<v Speaker 1>biological evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet it is,</v>

321
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it has emerged in tandem with continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction of its presuppositions by,</v>

322
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 1>by the selection process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still subject to error because </v>

323
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 1>we have a very limited viewpoint as </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific individuals.</v>

324
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

325
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.940
<v Speaker 1>not only are we limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also make,</v>

326
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you might say moral errors and I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to that cloud our judgment.</v>

327
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And so in an attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

328
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.160
<v Speaker 1>expand our purview and rectify those </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors,</v>

329
00:19:03.161 --> 00:19:08.161
<v Speaker 1>we do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We test our hypothesis practically </v>

330
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:08.980
<v Speaker 1>against the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say we say,</v>

331
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>here's a theory of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We acted out if the theory of reality is</v>

332
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:17.631
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently correct when we acted out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get what we want and then that's </v>

333
00:19:17.631 --> 00:19:19.360
<v Speaker 1>sufficient proof for the validity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

334
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not absolute proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficient proof.</v>

335
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this has been paid attention</v>

336
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:27.250
<v Speaker 1>to much less except by thinkers such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>

337
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.180
<v Speaker 1>is that we further constrain our </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumptions,</v>

338
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions about reality with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of constructing theories that </v>

339
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.891
<v Speaker 1>are also acceptable to people around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to be integratable within </v>

340
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the currently existing social contract,</v>

341
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and they have to be functionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate in the external world.</v>

342
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a nice set of constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that at least in</v>

343
00:19:54.431 --> 00:19:59.431
<v Speaker 1>some part goes along ways to answering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the objections to the,</v>

344
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Speaker 1>to the limits of the scientific method </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been discussed,</v>

345
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that were discussed and that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed that had been discussed </v>

346
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>historically that you just summarized.</v>

347
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic too much of what you </v>

348
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.581
<v Speaker 2>went through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The five point like a response to the </v>

349
00:20:18.581 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 2>kinds of arguments that have been played</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

350
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.870
<v Speaker 2>but you're actually putting me in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position then of the defending the </v>

351
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.080
<v Speaker 2>postmodern condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

352
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.020
<v Speaker 2>about how it would undercut each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those components.</v>

353
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a evolutionary epistemology and you give</v>

354
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 2>a nice sketch of one standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary epistemological framing,</v>

355
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.470
<v Speaker 2>which we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

356
00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe we have these Infield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a priority structures,</v>

357
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but we can rely upon them because here </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are standing at the long end of,</v>

358
00:20:48.001 --> 00:20:48.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands or millions of </v>

360
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 2>years of evolution and they would not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have survived or enabled us to survive </v>

361
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.440
<v Speaker 2>had they not serve some sort of reliable</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive role in accurately </v>

362
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.550
<v Speaker 2>representing the way that it works with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

363
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodern.</v>

364
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually too early for the </v>

365
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:11.720
<v Speaker 2>postmodern.</v>

366
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Postmodern will agree with this is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say all of that kind of begs the </v>

367
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 2>question right in a very deep way </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the kind of skeptical objections</v>

368
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:23.941
<v Speaker 2>that we're raising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in order to make that paragraph </v>

369
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 2>long description of what evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>epistemology is,</v>

370
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 2>what I have to do is take for granted as</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic assumptions,</v>

371
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 2>certain truth right about the world that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

372
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.540
<v Speaker 2>there is an external world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

373
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.980
<v Speaker 2>that we are biological creatures that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in built structures,</v>

374
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that those structures are evolutionarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsive and conditioning by changing </v>

375
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.510
<v Speaker 2>forces like and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you take those assumptions right </v>

376
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 2>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then as a consequence or inclusion,</v>

377
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.100
<v Speaker 2>you can infer that therefore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual products that come out of </v>

378
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 2>our cognitive processing or reliable </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in some way,</v>

379
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 2>but where did you get those for premises</v>
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>

380
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.910
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

381
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.450
<v Speaker 2>That there was an extra in a world.</v>

382
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that we are biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures?</v>

383
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.020
<v Speaker 2>How do you know for that evolution is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true with all of the historical </v>

384
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 2>knowledge is necessary to reach the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that evolution is true.</v>

385
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.690
<v Speaker 2>All of that presupposes that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate cognitive methods become to </v>

386
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:42.991
<v Speaker 2>understand the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our having legitimate cognitive </v>

387
00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:45.550
<v Speaker 2>processes understand the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what we are arguing about</v>

388
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 2>in the first place and you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that right for the sake of coming</v>

389
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:55.171
<v Speaker 2>up with some premises that are then in </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn going to validate those cognitive </v>

390
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something like that or say is there's</v>

391
00:22:58.121 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big circle,</v>

392
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.520
<v Speaker 2>a circular reasoning problem that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary epistemology find some </v>

393
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.890
<v Speaker 2>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then now I think there are some </v>

394
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>responses to that and this is just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first back and forth,</v>

395
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:16.681
<v Speaker 2>right on that particular debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is the kind of response that </v>

396
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:16.681
<v Speaker 2>will be there.</v>

397
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:21.020
<v Speaker 2>So the third and fourth are keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>track accurately is to say that we also </v>

398
00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.120
<v Speaker 2>have a constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

399
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.480
<v Speaker 2>with respect to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ourselves,</v>

400
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if we have a certain set of </v>

401
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 2>hypotheses are certainly fatal theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're testing them out,</v>

402
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will accept those that give us what </v>

403
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:38.790
<v Speaker 2>we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what I want.</v>

404
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 2>So the street and I'm also necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a social situation.</v>

405
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 2>So what you to do is check my results </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the,</v>

406
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:47.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of others.</v>

407
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Purely review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>

408
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 2>replication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like and so forth.</v>

409
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Or we live in the same household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

410
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 2>absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More prosaically,</v>

411
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sharing our frameworks right with each</v>

412
00:23:58.731 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

413
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if so to speak,</v>

414
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:06.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the more pragmatist </v>

415
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.240
<v Speaker 2>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we then say we have a theory or a set</v>

416
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:13.241
<v Speaker 2>of principles or guidelines or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they do enable me successful,</v>

417
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 2>you navigate the world or to get what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

418
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 2>or they do enable me to navigate my </v>
<v Speaker 2>social world.</v>

419
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:24.971
<v Speaker 2>We get us what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're reliable crew or some sort </v>

420
00:24:24.971 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 2>of a success label epistomological that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going.</v>

421
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you a question about this </v>

422
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 1>is a place where I got honored and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly with a Sam Harris.</v>

423
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 1>We were discussing metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption.</v>

424
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

425
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 1>and I'm confused about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree conceptually </v>

426
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an,</v>

427
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scientist and certainly operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time under the </v>

428
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 1>presupposition of an independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

429
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 1>But then I also have some difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that objective truth.</v>

430
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It's that it's objective truth within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which all other truths are nested.</v>

431
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:04.061
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that Sam and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that he represents in some </v>

432
00:25:04.061 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 1>sense are very dead set on insisting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

433
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.410
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me though that the crux of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the matter is something like the method </v>

434
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:16.451
<v Speaker 1>of proof and districts me is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because my theory is correct </v>

435
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.080
<v Speaker 1>enough if when I implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what I want is not the same as the</v>

436
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

437
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 1>My theory is true because it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with some independently </v>

438
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 1>existing objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean both of those things can exist at</v>

439
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:36.761
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the more appropriate claim </v>

440
00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:40.480
<v Speaker 1>to make with regards to human knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like it's biological </v>

441
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.201
<v Speaker 1>functionality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that your knowledge is of </v>

442
00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>sufficient accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about the best you can hope for</v>

443
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:51.311
<v Speaker 1>because of your fundamental ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If when you implemented it reliably </v>

444
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:55.991
<v Speaker 1>produces the results that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>commensurate say with your continued </v>

445
00:25:55.991 --> 00:25:59.501
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to me that that's a </v>

446
00:25:59.501 --> 00:25:59.501
<v Speaker 1>reasonable claim from a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

447
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:04.151
<v Speaker 1>And it also seems to me that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much in keeping with the claims of the </v>

448
00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:05.560
<v Speaker 1>American pragmatists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

449
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they were radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists because they weren't,</v>

450
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but they were trying to solve this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem to some degree of our </v>

451
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.191
<v Speaker 1>fundamental ignorance and our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our inability to be certain about the </v>

452
00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>nature of the reality that surrounds us.</v>

453
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's set aside a Sam Harris's a version</v>

454
00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:27.810
<v Speaker 2>of this and focus on the pragmatist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reggie tradition here.</v>

455
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

456
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.560
<v Speaker 2>A William James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Dewey,</v>

457
00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:32.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the others,</v>

458
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.650
<v Speaker 2>late 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century.</v>

459
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:40.130
<v Speaker 2>They are coming a century after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content revolution after ideally ism,</v>

460
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

461
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:50.421
<v Speaker 2>And so they are very much trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve this problem one way.</v>

462
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And this is a very American right sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things to say.</v>

463
00:26:53.141 --> 00:26:58.141
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the problem with philosophy is </v>

464
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:01.371
<v Speaker 2>that we have been to like intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>ising like cognition that we're not just</v>

465
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.040
<v Speaker 2>embodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brains are disembodied minds that are </v>

466
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 2>trying to kind of contemplate abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some other realm.</v>

467
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what we need to do is understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

468
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.030
<v Speaker 2>The mind and cognition as a naturalistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and that the purpose of </v>

469
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>knowledge is not to come up with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pure and beautiful truths that are going</v>

470
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 2>to be kind of museum pieces that we will</v>
<v Speaker 2>admire her,</v>

471
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.760
<v Speaker 2>but rather the purpose of knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

472
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of knowledge is to guide </v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

473
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they will then harking back to </v>

474
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.540
<v Speaker 2>the earlier they konijn traditional the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge knowledge is not an end in </v>

475
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as they can afford it.</v>

476
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:51.410
<v Speaker 2>A Francis Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knowledge is power and by its fruits,</v>

477
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to speak,</v>

478
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.400
<v Speaker 2>you know it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we then should do is to see </v>

479
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.351
<v Speaker 2>that the chest of crew is not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it meets purely intellectual </v>

480
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:11.271
<v Speaker 2>standards of logic and mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather when we put it to practice </v>

481
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:17.721
<v Speaker 2>and then we act upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually get good results or we get </v>

482
00:28:17.721 --> 00:28:22.221
<v Speaker 2>the results we want or I get the results</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will become and more individualistic </v>

483
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:24.920
<v Speaker 2>form or more socialized,</v>

484
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then we can get on.</v>

485
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>That's ignorance in some sense.</v>

486
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So there's two things that are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>packaged here,</v>

487
00:28:31.511 --> 00:28:36.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is to say that knowledge right is </v>

488
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:37.400
<v Speaker 2>functional and that part I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

489
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very nice correction or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pragmatists are,</v>

490
00:28:41.151 --> 00:28:46.151
<v Speaker 2>it's not original with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are re emphasizing that in the </v>

491
00:28:46.151 --> 00:28:49.601
<v Speaker 2>19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge needs to be pushed to the </v>

492
00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:49.601
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

493
00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:52.010
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ability to do,</v>

494
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.330
<v Speaker 2>enable us to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

495
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:58.450
<v Speaker 2>to be pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so to speak in the real world is a </v>

496
00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:58.450
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

497
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a code to data as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is relevant to Thomas </v>

498
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn's discussion of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions because code is often read </v>

499
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.800
<v Speaker 1>as positing a sequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense discontinuous revolutions.</v>

500
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you and,</v>

501
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

502
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.970
<v Speaker 1>and that the conceptual structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized one epoch,</v>

503
00:29:19.971 --> 00:29:24.971
<v Speaker 1>let's say like the Medieval Lee Park was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so totally different and it's </v>

504
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:28.190
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions from the conceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize the next.</v>

505
00:29:28.191 --> 00:29:31.160
<v Speaker 1>He parked that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't even mediate between them</v>

506
00:29:31.161 --> 00:29:36.161
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the reason I'm bringing this up </v>

507
00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:38.921
<v Speaker 1>is because coon is at least read as </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesizing that there's not any </v>

508
00:29:38.921 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>necessary progress when you make leaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one conceptual system to another.</v>

509
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>But if you take this pragmatic approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that we've been outlining,</v>

510
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

511
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conceptions of the world are more </v>

512
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.831
<v Speaker 1>tool like than objective truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and tools can have a greater or </v>

513
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>lesser range of convenience.</v>

514
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
<v Speaker 1>And so if you come up with a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>tool which would also be something that </v>

515
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 1>would look objectively true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

516
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.150
<v Speaker 1>then that's something that you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>in almost every situation and it will </v>

517
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.391
<v Speaker 1>never fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I would think of something like </v>

518
00:30:15.391 --> 00:30:18.061
<v Speaker 1>Newtonian physics and in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even more particularly quantum </v>

519
00:30:18.061 --> 00:30:22.380
<v Speaker 1>mechanics because it's never failed us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it seems to me the pragmatic </v>

520
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 1>approach in some sense allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your cake and eat it too.</v>

521
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You can pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy of truths,</v>

522
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>moving towards an absolute truth even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also retain your belief in your own </v>

523
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.991
<v Speaker 1>ignorance and not have to beat the drum </v>
<v Speaker 1>too hard about the like what eternal </v>

524
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>accuracy of your objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

525
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

526
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic.</v>

527
00:30:44.331 --> 00:30:49.331
<v Speaker 2>I think with about 80 percent of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me put my skeptical hat back on </v>

528
00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:51.660
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

529
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.680
<v Speaker 2>how the postmoderns or the critics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism for first generation </v>

530
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.960
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism will respond to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we then say,</v>

531
00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.310
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these,</v>

532
00:31:01.311 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive results and to rephrase,</v>

533
00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.820
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to assess all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive,</v>

534
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>results or cognitive hypotheses in terms</v>

535
00:31:14.121 --> 00:31:19.121
<v Speaker 2>of their work with unity or they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting what I want or what we want.</v>

536
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the big question we have to turn to</v>

537
00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:22.730
<v Speaker 2>is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

538
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 2>how do we judge whether something works </v>
<v Speaker 2>or say that it's good because I get what</v>

539
00:31:33.411 --> 00:31:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get what we want,</v>

540
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.410
<v Speaker 2>what is a want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

541
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And where do these wants come from and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why should we accept wants and desires </v>

542
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

543
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.800
<v Speaker 2>achieving certain goals as our bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

544
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

545
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

546
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.780
<v Speaker 1>So you can start to question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework,</v>

547
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 1>the framework within which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructing the answer.</v>

548
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:03.290
<v Speaker 2>That's where I end at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're leading epistemology right </v>

549
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:03.540
<v Speaker 2>neutrally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

550
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:08.541
<v Speaker 2>and moving into normative issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole status of normative,</v>

551
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goals and,</v>

552
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.680
<v Speaker 2>and then the means that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enable us to reach,</v>

553
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 2>reach rather those ends comes into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I want to say the it's important </v>

554
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.830
<v Speaker 2>thing is that I put it very baldly here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

555
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.080
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

556
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:29.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to assess intellectual </v>

557
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.741
<v Speaker 2>structures and beliefs and hypotheses in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of do they give me what I want?</v>

558
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that already sounds like a fairly,</v>

559
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normatively subjectivist standpoint.</v>

560
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Why should you take your wants as having</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of high status it,</v>

561
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.970
<v Speaker 2>everything has to be evaluated in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a.</v>

562
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 2>and then philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we say,</v>

563
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where'd wants come from?</v>

564
00:32:54.331 --> 00:32:57.000
<v Speaker 2>And forces along anthropological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

565
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.650
<v Speaker 2>that set of literature a here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

566
00:32:59.651 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 2>what's the relationship of our ones?</v>

567
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Are they based in biological drives or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the instinctual or they acquired or the </v>

568
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:11.951
<v Speaker 2>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have any relationship to our </v>

569
00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:15.521
<v Speaker 2>rational capacities when I'm acting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I act on my desires and my wants,</v>

570
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:16.580
<v Speaker 2>my console?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So poor.</v>

571
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So there's that whole tradition and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have a sophisticated theory </v>

572
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 2>about how all of that is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to say we'll solve all </v>

573
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>these cognitive because the mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues in terms of once or the </v>

574
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.251
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction of desires or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement of goals the way private </v>

575
00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 2>does want us to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

576
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly easy to,</v>

577
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to imagine what the skeptical you're </v>

578
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 2>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

579
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 2>If it's a matter of what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

580
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 2>isn't science supposed to be about </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up with general truths,</v>

581
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

582
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:55.421
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even universal cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we're immediately going to </v>

583
00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:57.210
<v Speaker 2>devolve it to whatever individuals want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then we're going to be in there</v>

584
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.240
<v Speaker 1>fairly scattered because that also opens</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a good point for a segue into the </v>

585
00:34:03.061 --> 00:34:06.150
<v Speaker 1>potential link between new Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

586
00:34:06.151 --> 00:34:11.151
<v Speaker 1>and postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you could say once you've </v>

587
00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 1>opened the door to an admission that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can criticize the,</v>

588
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.360
<v Speaker 1>the idea of want as a social construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

589
00:34:18.361 --> 00:34:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Which is one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimated,</v>

590
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 1>nor the only thing obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you open the door to also making </v>

591
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 1>the claim that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

592
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>that social construct that governs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants that governs the truth can be </v>

593
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 1>governed by power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

594
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by unfair power relationship so</v>

595
00:34:35.731 --> 00:34:37.650
<v Speaker 1>you can spin off down that aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

596
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the other thing I really want</v>

597
00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:42.240
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you about is because on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one hand,</v>

598
00:34:42.241 --> 00:34:47.241
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernists are following this </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual tradition of the critique </v>

599
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:48.180
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of western thinking,</v>

600
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.780
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly in some sense what </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy should be doing,</v>

601
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but in another way they seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously to be introducing almost </v>

602
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.431
<v Speaker 1>by sleight of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of social critique that has its </v>

603
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:03.180
<v Speaker 1>origin more in political revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>class based theory.</v>

604
00:35:03.181 --> 00:35:08.181
<v Speaker 1>And they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that under the guise of pure </v>

605
00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:12.261
<v Speaker 1>philosophy in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with the intent and motivation of </v>

606
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:14.910
<v Speaker 1>something like justifying the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution or continuing the Marxist,</v>

607
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist analysis of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>differential.</v>

608
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It can go both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

609
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it is possible that follow the road that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've just been going down to say,</v>

610
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 2>if it's a matter about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

612
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what works for you,</v>

613
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 2>then that immediately starts to sound to</v>
<v Speaker 2>relativistic and subjectivist.</v>

614
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 2>We don't have</v>

615
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 2>an explanation or an answer rather to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Weirdos want to do strange </v>

616
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Speaker 2>things because that's what they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

617
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.900
<v Speaker 2>So we might introduce as a corrective a </v>
<v Speaker 2>socializing right of the process.</v>

618
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.500
<v Speaker 2>So we might then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

619
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much what you want as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

620
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 2>but rather what we want and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve some sort of a consensus here.</v>

621
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>So this is a slightly cartoon version </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

622
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:57.981
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between William James</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was more individualistic and John </v>

623
00:35:57.981 --> 00:35:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Dewey in the next generation will </v>
<v Speaker 2>collect advisors things,</v>

624
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:04.570
<v Speaker 2>right a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we have a corrective on all of </v>

625
00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 2>the individual Weirdos who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their desires and goals,</v>

626
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 2>right are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

627
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.160
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to confront the same problem there </v>

628
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 2>as soon as we start doing anthropology </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then if we say,</v>

629
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:18.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we relativize it to the social group </v>

630
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:18.171
<v Speaker 2>and when we start looking at different </v>
<v Speaker 2>social groups,</v>

631
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:22.971
<v Speaker 2>obviously different social groups have </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically different wants and needs </v>

632
00:36:22.971 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and desires and evolve very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions.</v>

633
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And if it's a matter of saying what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true is what works for the group,</v>

634
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is then no sorta speak Uber Group,</v>

635
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

636
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:39.951
<v Speaker 2>or highest group of all groups that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>status overall of the others.</v>

637
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 2>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the second point that you </v>

638
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

639
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

640
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.060
<v Speaker 2>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

641
00:36:47.061 --> 00:36:47.480
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

642
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 2>this group's norms and goals are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that group's goals,</v>

643
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:55.310
<v Speaker 2>or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're into a,</v>

644
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 2>what the critics are going to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperialism,</v>

645
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:58.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of,</v>

646
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

647
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.990
<v Speaker 2>of the Lgu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate form,</v>

648
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leaves us,</v>

649
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that leaves us with our current </v>
<v Speaker 1>political situation in some sense,</v>

650
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 1>which is because that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

651
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.240
<v Speaker 1>that idea has been taken to what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a logical conclusion.</v>

652
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And that logical conclusion has now been</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated to a large degree as a,</v>

653
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.260
<v Speaker 1>as an intellectual and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist movement.</v>

654
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say that.</v>

655
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

656
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>So it can start as an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that we're trying to do some </v>

657
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 2>hardcore epistemology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

658
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:35.301
<v Speaker 2>And we go through the empiricism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rationalist and the content </v>

659
00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pragmatists are right now,</v>

660
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:40.521
<v Speaker 2>we're in the second generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism where we'd relativize </v>

661
00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:43.071
<v Speaker 2>relative to various kinds of groups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're just stuck in a kind of group</v>

662
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200
<v Speaker 2>relativism and then the operational </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles socially then is going to be </v>

663
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 2>that each group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

664
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:54.171
<v Speaker 2>should stick to itself and not think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can impose its ideas and its </v>

665
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>norms on any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any other group.</v>

666
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All groups so to speak,</v>

667
00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Speaker 2>are equal.</v>

668
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an equal claim to have an </v>

669
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.190
<v Speaker 1>equal claim to their formulation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

670
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.610
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjunction with neo Marxism to me,</v>

671
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of idea,</v>

672
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:19.431
<v Speaker 1>that there's an intrinsic moral claim by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dispossessed to the,</v>

673
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.100
<v Speaker 1>to the obtaining of status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually constitutes a higher </v>

674
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 1>moral calling in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're swallowing a moral claim that</v>

675
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it making it universal in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

676
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 1>they criticize the idea of say general </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives are universal moral claims.</v>

677
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's</v>

678
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 2>also A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

679
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the other way rather than </v>

680
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:41.660
<v Speaker 2>starting with epistemology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

681
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 2>In ending up getting into a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural relativism,</v>

682
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can start a course committed to a </v>

683
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 2>certain normative framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular certain ideological framework,</v>

684
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Marxism is where you're very critical</v>

685
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.940
<v Speaker 2>part of one of those traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the cultural relativism can be </v>

686
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.070
<v Speaker 2>right a part of that that you used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize the tradition,</v>

687
00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internal.</v>

688
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Now then we're explicitly into a not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>met an ethics and asking where do we get</v>

689
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:16.110
<v Speaker 2>our ethical principles off the ground or</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do they come from in the first </v>

690
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.191
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kind of a robust normative ethics </v>

691
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:23.710
<v Speaker 2>where people have committed commitments </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather to fairly strong ethical </v>

692
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:29.311
<v Speaker 2>principles and ethical ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is where there was a debate </v>

693
00:39:29.311 --> 00:39:33.951
<v Speaker 2>between say Nisha and mark's becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant and this is a late 19th century</v>

694
00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:35.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

695
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I suppose we say as both the Marxists</v>

696
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:43.730
<v Speaker 2>who will do is say there is no proof in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any objective sense.</v>

697
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

698
00:39:45.361 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 2>we have the subjectivity in relativity </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular very sorts and we have different</v>

699
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:55.151
<v Speaker 2>individuals in different groups and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in antagonistic conflict,</v>

700
00:39:56.211 --> 00:40:01.211
<v Speaker 2>relationship with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means there's not really going </v>

701
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:01.920
<v Speaker 2>to be any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.710
<v Speaker 2>know rational and civil resolution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these discussions with each other.</v>

703
00:40:06.711 --> 00:40:11.711
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to power a sleight of </v>

704
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 2>hand claim there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because why?</v>

705
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:19.741
<v Speaker 2>It has to come down to powers that seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to introduce the necessary need.</v>

706
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

707
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We set that aside just for a moment,</v>

708
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we say,</v>

709
00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have power,</v>

710
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that we can say is,</v>

711
00:40:30.621 --> 00:40:35.621
<v Speaker 2>while we don't think any one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any one group has a better objective </v>

712
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:41.921
<v Speaker 2>claim to truth or better ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is nonetheless the case that some </v>

713
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.460
<v Speaker 2>individuals and groups have more power </v>
<v Speaker 2>than others.</v>

714
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And so then we have to make our </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegiance clear in this unequal power </v>

715
00:40:52.281 --> 00:40:57.281
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we on the side of those who have </v>

716
00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:58.550
<v Speaker 2>more power or are we on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those who have less power?</v>

717
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's where we get then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean and Marxian that fork in the</v>

718
00:41:02.571 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

719
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:05.750
<v Speaker 2>So the nutrients following nature will </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

720
00:41:05.751 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

721
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.840
<v Speaker 2>it's all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

722
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.560
<v Speaker 2>then we can try on some crude </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary thinking here.</v>

723
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's only the exercise of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right by the stronger,</v>

724
00:41:16.311 --> 00:41:17.870
<v Speaker 2>the fitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>

725
00:41:17.871 --> 00:41:22.871
<v Speaker 2>and so forth that are willing to impose </v>
<v Speaker 2>their power on the weaker and use them </v>

726
00:41:23.811 --> 00:41:27.530
<v Speaker 2>for their own ends that we as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals and groups are going to make</v>

727
00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:30.020
<v Speaker 2>any sort of progress toward the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>best thing.</v>

728
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.290
<v Speaker 2>But whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the power struggle,</v>

729
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 2>there is no objective morality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective truth,</v>

730
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:42.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just throw our lot in with the </v>

731
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.790
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the richer,</v>

732
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 2>with the more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say whatever it is that they do</v>

733
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:50.111
<v Speaker 2>in order to advance themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's normative best that we can do </v>

734
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

735
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a long,</v>

736
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 2>kind of aristocratic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

737
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovative thinking that one can draw on</v>

738
00:41:56.721 --> 00:42:00.150
<v Speaker 2>to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a Marxist mattress rather,</v>

739
00:42:00.151 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 2>of course it was on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that equation,</v>

740
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where their sympathies,</v>

741
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:06.340
<v Speaker 2>right initially are going to be say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.440
<v Speaker 2>in any power struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our kind of a prior or I commitments </v>

743
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.680
<v Speaker 2>that should always be to the weaker to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those on the losing end or the pistol,</v>

744
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:22.150
<v Speaker 2>those who suffer and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always the rich and powerful </v>

745
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.301
<v Speaker 2>people who are oppressing and harming </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and so we throw our lot in with the</v>

746
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:33.491
<v Speaker 2>weaker and we're willing to use power </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever amount of power we have on </v>

747
00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:37.601
<v Speaker 2>behalf of the weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when we're just into what I </v>

748
00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:42.011
<v Speaker 2>think of as the major false alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really has driven much of 20th </v>

749
00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:44.630
<v Speaker 2>century with intellectual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a nutrient or are you a Marxist?</v>

750
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

751
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:51.671
<v Speaker 1>so now we can get to the crux of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter here to some degree because to </v>

752
00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:53.630
<v Speaker 1>even engage in that argument means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the a priority position.</v>

753
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Which would you made quite rationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling?</v>

754
00:42:56.481 --> 00:43:01.481
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that its power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its power because there's no other way </v>

755
00:43:01.481 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 1>of differentiating between the claims of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different groups.</v>

756
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.140
<v Speaker 1>It's power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the determining issue.</v>

757
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.740
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's something I really have a </v>

758
00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.751
<v Speaker 1>problem with and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's crucial importance </v>

759
00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a big difference between</v>

760
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:19.151
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between power and </v>

761
00:43:19.151 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 1>authority and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all not the same thing because</v>

762
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you might be willing to see greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>status to me in some domains,</v>

763
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 1>if there are things I can do that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>value that you can't do,</v>

764
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's not power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

765
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Power seems to be more than I'm willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use force to impose my interpretation</v>

766
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 1>of the world to get my wants fulfilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>on you,</v>

767
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists make a huge mistake.</v>

768
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Not that the Nietzsche ends aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes as well,</v>

769
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:49.391
<v Speaker 1>but for the Marxists make a huge mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they failed to properly </v>

770
00:43:49.391 --> 00:43:53.051
<v Speaker 1>differentiate between hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that are predicated on </v>

771
00:43:53.051 --> 00:43:57.371
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical power and hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that are predicated on </v>

772
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence and mutual consent.</v>

773
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Because those and the other issue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they failed to contend with,</v>

774
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this is a form of willful </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>

775
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:12.881
<v Speaker 1>is that it isn't obviously the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every society is set up equally to only </v>

776
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:19.841
<v Speaker 1>fulfill the desires of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in principle situated at the </v>

777
00:44:19.841 --> 00:44:24.521
<v Speaker 1>pinnacles of the hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think that that's </v>

778
00:44:24.521 --> 00:44:27.401
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally characteristic of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western tradition because it has a very </v>

779
00:44:27.401 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 1>strong emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>

780
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:32.741
<v Speaker 1>and this is how I think it extracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out of the social socialized,</v>

781
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 1>the conundrum that accepting a a </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized version of truth presents to </v>

782
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

783
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.480
<v Speaker 1>The West does two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says we have a social contract that </v>

784
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 1>constraints are views of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our actions in it,</v>

785
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:51.381
<v Speaker 1>but that social contract is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously subordinate to the idea </v>

786
00:44:51.381 --> 00:44:55.341
<v Speaker 1>of the sovereignty of each individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the social contract is bound to </v>

787
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>serve the needs of each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not any privileged set of individuals.</v>

788
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:06.891
<v Speaker 1>Although sometimes it works out that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't believe that the postmodern </v>

789
00:45:06.891 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 1>NSF contended with that properly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

790
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>With their criticism of logo centers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

791
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:12.990
<v Speaker 1>which was something that characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

792
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

793
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It never has seemed to me that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had with Stalinist Russia and and the </v>

794
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:26.391
<v Speaker 1>Marxist view of the world and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had on the side of the West was merely a</v>

795
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.140
<v Speaker 1>matter of a difference of opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two equally valid socialized </v>

796
00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 1>modes of interpreting the world.</v>

797
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:39.170
<v Speaker 1>You know there's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something more to the view of </v>

798
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.710
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what's in battle,</v>

799
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.270
<v Speaker 1>what's embodied in the conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and socialism.</v>

800
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Because it could've just been a matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of argumentation and opinion.</v>

801
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fault.</v>

802
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And I thought this way in part because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of piaget,</v>

803
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.340
<v Speaker 1>because piaget was interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intrinsic constraints.</v>

804
00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:04.341
<v Speaker 1>We're on a social contract and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was trying to address this issue </v>

805
00:46:04.341 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 1>of the insufficiency of want as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

806
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.460
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a tool to justify your claims to </v>

807
00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.551
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he introduced the idea </v>

808
00:46:16.551 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 1>of the equilibrated state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're sophisticated,</v>

809
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to put forward your want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then need it in a way that will meet it </v>

810
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 1>today and tomorrow and next month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year and in a decade.</v>

811
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 1>So you have to iterate yourself across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you have to take all of the </v>

812
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:40.070
<v Speaker 1>iterations of yourself across time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree of seriousness and then you </v>

813
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:44.871
<v Speaker 1>also have to do the same thing as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>extend yourself out into the social </v>

814
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:47.961
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be what's good for me now </v>

815
00:46:47.961 --> 00:46:51.650
<v Speaker 1>and repetitively into the future in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that simultaneously good for you </v>

816
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 1>now and simultaneously into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that starts to become an.</v>

817
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>playable game,</v>

818
00:46:57.701 --> 00:47:00.030
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The voluntarily playable game.</v>

819
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's something deep about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it includes the idea of </v>

820
00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:05.540
<v Speaker 1>iteration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

821
00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 1>iterated interpretations into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

822
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 1>which strikes me as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crucial importance.</v>

823
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

824
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by my count about six very </v>

825
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.611
<v Speaker 2>interesting subtopics built into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the latter part of a very nice </v>

826
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.730
<v Speaker 2>statement I think of kind of lightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant humanism where we're going to take</v>

827
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:31.831
<v Speaker 2>power seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going a constraint power in a </v>

828
00:47:31.831 --> 00:47:36.091
<v Speaker 2>way that respects the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously enables individuals to </v>

829
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>form mutually beneficial social network </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time.</v>

830
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

831
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.980
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sympathetic to a,</v>

832
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.680
<v Speaker 2>that overall right construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 2>that comes out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part,</v>

834
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 2>which is a taxonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

835
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:58.441
<v Speaker 2>That you're offering about the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and that taxonomy does differ </v>

836
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:03.451
<v Speaker 2>significantly from both the Marxist and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Nietzschean one I would say is,</v>

837
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better to take power right </v>

838
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.860
<v Speaker 2>more neutrally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

839
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 2>so there's a continuity with what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicists do.</v>

840
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 2>My understanding there is a power or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

841
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 2>the ability to get work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

842
00:48:20.741 --> 00:48:24.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a tool and functionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

843
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:29.641
<v Speaker 2>Language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right power is what gets you from a to </v>

844
00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:29.641
<v Speaker 2>B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

845
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I love that description because it fits </v>
<v Speaker 1>very nicely in with the narrative </v>

846
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.440
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because narratives seem to be </v>

847
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.620
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of something like how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get from point a to point B,</v>

848
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also doesn't say anything about </v>

849
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 2>being in the status of be how we choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we should be going,</v>

850
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.760
<v Speaker 2>but what our ends are or what are our </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals are going.</v>

851
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:56.690
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power is normatively neutral.</v>

852
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a means to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

853
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.460
<v Speaker 2>and that means that when we start to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evaluate the uses of power,</v>

854
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be evaluating power in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the ends towards which is put </v>

855
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can end with that pip position.</v>

856
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now then we say,</v>

857
00:49:17.481 --> 00:49:22.481
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well power comes in all kinds of </v>

858
00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:22.481
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

859
00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:24.710
<v Speaker 2>We're quite happy to say those </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual power or the ability to use</v>

860
00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:29.711
<v Speaker 2>our minds to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address and solve certain problems </v>

861
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:32.630
<v Speaker 2>that there's muscular power will the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to move physical objects.</v>

862
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a social power people respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and are,</v>

863
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:41.790
<v Speaker 2>are willing to spend time with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>divert resources to voluntarily and so </v>

864
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.890
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

865
00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:44.600
<v Speaker 2>there's military power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political power,</v>

866
00:49:44.601 --> 00:49:48.080
<v Speaker 2>and so we're going to have a whole set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of subspecies of power.</v>

867
00:49:48.081 --> 00:49:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And what they all have in common is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in each of those domains,</v>

868
00:49:51.891 --> 00:49:56.891
<v Speaker 2>there are goals and having the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>enables you to achieve your goals in </v>

869
00:49:56.891 --> 00:49:57.440
<v Speaker 2>those domains.</v>

870
00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we shouldn't fall prey to the </v>

871
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:02.720
<v Speaker 1>illusion that there's necessarily any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

872
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.610
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unifying matrix that makes all those </v>

873
00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:08.100
<v Speaker 1>different forms of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

874
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:11.100
<v Speaker 1>similar except for the terminology you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

875
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.480
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another thing that bothers </v>

876
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.860
<v Speaker 1>me about the both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nietzschean in the Marxist Marxist </v>

877
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.801
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's this proclivity to </v>

878
00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:24.141
<v Speaker 1>collapse these multiple modes of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>into power itself and that's not </v>

879
00:50:24.141 --> 00:50:28.971
<v Speaker 1>reasonable because if it's reasonable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>note many of the forms of power that you</v>

880
00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:34.061
<v Speaker 1>just described contend against one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another rather than mutually fortifying </v>

881
00:50:34.061 --> 00:50:34.660
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

882
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like the balance of power in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a polity like the American polity,</v>

883
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a deep point that you're making </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

884
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I think both the Marxists and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean to do ended up collapsing </v>

885
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:50.340
<v Speaker 2>power into a unitary type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

886
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.390
<v Speaker 2>that's when the steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a mistake only if you deny </v>

887
00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As both the marshals and the Nietzschean</v>

888
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.360
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a deep individuality right </v>

889
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.290
<v Speaker 2>about a world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think by contrast,</v>

890
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:10.320
<v Speaker 2>right about the kind of individual human</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights respecting and lightening and </v>

891
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.660
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're articulating that I agree with as</v>

892
00:51:13.661 --> 00:51:16.780
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For normatively,</v>

893
00:51:16.781 --> 00:51:21.781
<v Speaker 2>that wants to devolve social power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual or individuals with a </v>

894
00:51:22.931 --> 00:51:27.931
<v Speaker 2>great deal of self responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over their own domain.</v>

895
00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the speed and the idea then is that </v>

896
00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.911
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to form social </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships or any sort of social </v>

897
00:51:35.911 --> 00:51:39.931
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be mutually respecting that I </v>

898
00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:43.981
<v Speaker 2>have to respect your control over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain and you respect my control over </v>

899
00:51:43.981 --> 00:51:47.020
<v Speaker 2>my domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we agreed to share domains,</v>

900
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.460
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that voluntary.</v>

901
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

902
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And this is a place where I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>post modernists are really open to you </v>

903
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 1>might say conceptual assault is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

904
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.670
<v Speaker 1>in order to have that freedom devolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon the individual in that manner,</v>

905
00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:09.671
<v Speaker 1>it also means that the individual has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for acting as a </v>

906
00:52:09.671 --> 00:52:14.261
<v Speaker 1>locus of power in world actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and cannot conceive of </v>

907
00:52:14.261 --> 00:52:19.121
<v Speaker 1>themselves or act in a manner that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them an Avatar of a social </v>

908
00:52:19.121 --> 00:52:22.631
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that art of the preferred </v>

909
00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:26.040
<v Speaker 1>anthony individualism of the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left is precisely predicated on that </v>

910
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.810
<v Speaker 1>refusal to take responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also reflected in the</v>

911
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 1>fact that by temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're low in trait conscientiousness,</v>

912
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 1>so it's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not merely an opinion,</v>

913
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an expression of something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>even deeper than opinion</v>

914
00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.320
<v Speaker 2>prayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Locus of responsibility,</v>

915
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 2>locus of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locus of control.</v>

916
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You're right that the far left in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist in Neo Marxists form does deny </v>

917
00:52:50.361 --> 00:52:55.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also find that in far right in </v>

918
00:52:56.091 --> 00:52:56.990
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

919
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>So this is a bit of cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

920
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:00.570
<v Speaker 2>To intellectual history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

921
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 2>But then if you try to trace it to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist on the left and the nutrients on</v>

922
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:08.861
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them do denied that individuals </v>

923
00:53:08.861 --> 00:53:12.311
<v Speaker 2>are locus Loci,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather have responsibility by both of </v>

924
00:53:12.311 --> 00:53:15.731
<v Speaker 2>them in their views of human nature have</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly deterministic views for what we</v>

925
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 2>call an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

926
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:19.710
<v Speaker 2>According to both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

927
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just a vehicle through which right </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside forces are flowing,</v>

928
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

929
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

930
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:32.211
<v Speaker 1>you can also see that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a perverse consequence of the </v>

931
00:53:32.211 --> 00:53:34.950
<v Speaker 1>scientific revolution because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>still see this among modern scientists.</v>

932
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

933
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>what are the causal forces that regulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>human behavior?</v>

934
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two primary sources,</v>

935
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.850
<v Speaker 1>mature slash biology and culture.</v>

936
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's the crude nature versus nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate being played out through them.</v>

937
00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

938
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

939
00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've derived this conclusion from </v>

940
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:59.241
<v Speaker 1>studying mythology mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a missing third element </v>

941
00:53:59.241 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is whatever the active force,</v>

942
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:05.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>active force of individual </v>

943
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.030
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

944
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a good grounds right in </v>

945
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.740
<v Speaker 2>being an independent private initiator </v>
<v Speaker 2>of power instead of merely a responder </v>

946
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.610
<v Speaker 2>to other power forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

947
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Or a vehicle through which those other </v>
<v Speaker 2>power forces operate.</v>

948
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.600
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individualism,</v>

949
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

950
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.530
<v Speaker 2>that is built into enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanism.</v>

951
00:54:26.531 --> 00:54:31.531
<v Speaker 2>We start to see it developing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>renaissance humanism is to take </v>

952
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:31.531
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

953
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:34.510
<v Speaker 2>The notion that individuals have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure,</v>

954
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.870
<v Speaker 2>some significant measure of control over</v>
<v Speaker 2>their Fox,</v>

955
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.310
<v Speaker 2>over the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shape,</v>

956
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.660
<v Speaker 2>the shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own destiny,</v>

957
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:47.170
<v Speaker 2>and that is fundamental right to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral dignity as a human being.</v>

958
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 2>And so that is going to be a live view </v>
<v Speaker 2>of human nature built into the ethics </v>

959
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of social relationships </v>

960
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.060
<v Speaker 2>have to be respectful of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuality.</v>

961
00:55:01.061 --> 00:55:06.061
<v Speaker 2>And then consequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we start to turn to political </v>

962
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:06.400
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we thought knockabout very heavy duty</v>

963
00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:10.270
<v Speaker 2>use of power such as the police and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

964
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:13.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to have a serious constraints on</v>

965
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:18.630
<v Speaker 2>government power to make sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are respecting the individual </v>

966
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.820
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty.</v>

967
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something perverse to that,</v>

968
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.480
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emerges as a consequence of </v>

969
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Speaker 1>something you pointed out earlier in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

970
00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:30.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that when modernism emerge</v>

971
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:36.110
<v Speaker 1>out of medieval Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two things happened and one was the </v>

972
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.351
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of the conceptual frames </v>
<v Speaker 1>that enabled us to deal with the </v>

973
00:55:39.351 --> 00:55:42.471
<v Speaker 1>external world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other was the elevation of the </v>

974
00:55:42.471 --> 00:55:45.561
<v Speaker 1>individual to the status of valid critic</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that there was </v>

975
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>something actually valid about </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual experience as such.</v>

976
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem there as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

977
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in this conundrum,</v>

978
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:58.341
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elaboration of the objective </v>

979
00:55:58.341 --> 00:56:02.301
<v Speaker 1>scientific viewpoint let us left us with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that it was either nature or </v>

980
00:56:02.551 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 1>nurture that was the source of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive power.</v>

981
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.700
<v Speaker 1>But the missing element there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

982
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:13.701
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why grant to the individual to </v>

983
00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:14.670
<v Speaker 1>begin with the role of independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>social critic?</v>

984
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Like on what grounds do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like the,</v>

985
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like the resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a residual belief in something</v>

986
00:56:20.851 --> 00:56:25.851
<v Speaker 1>like the autonomy of the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just sneak in and not justify </v>

987
00:56:25.851 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

988
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 1>without problems like the ones that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now.</v>

989
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That's well put and I think it's fair to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that we still are in the infancy of </v>

990
00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.830
<v Speaker 2>the psychological sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can speak to this better than I can,</v>

991
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:43.831
<v Speaker 2>but as someone in philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're still at the beginnings </v>

992
00:56:43.831 --> 00:56:48.060
<v Speaker 2>and we are still in the grip of early </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crude versions,</v>

993
00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.290
<v Speaker 2>crude scientific understandings of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause and effect operators.</v>

994
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 2>And so what we are starting with is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical,</v>

995
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandings.</v>

996
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And we can understand how people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are pushed around by biological forces.</v>

997
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 2>We can understand to some extent now the</v>
<v Speaker 2>push around by the external,</v>

998
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:09.481
<v Speaker 2>physical and mechanical forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do not yet have a sophisticated </v>

999
00:57:09.481 --> 00:57:11.260
<v Speaker 2>enough understanding of the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human mind,</v>

1000
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:16.261
<v Speaker 2>human psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To understand how a volitional </v>

1001
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:20.401
<v Speaker 2>consciousness can be a causal force </v>
<v Speaker 2>causal power in the world.</v>

1002
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's perfectly put.</v>

1003
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a detailed analysis that some of </v>

1004
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the people who watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're familiar with this movie Pinocchio</v>

1005
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and Un Occhio is got a very classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological structure and it basically </v>

1006
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.201
<v Speaker 1>introduces three elements of va,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the element of being that's </v>

1007
00:57:39.201 --> 00:57:43.550
<v Speaker 1>associated with Japan and also the evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical forces that are kind of </v>

1008
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:46.290
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal in nature and that's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptualization of society.</v>

1009
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been evolent element and a level at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elements.</v>

1010
00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the introduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this other causal factor in it.</v>

1011
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:58.900
<v Speaker 1>It's personified in the form of the blue</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy in the blue fairy is a </v>

1012
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.840
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of mother nature and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>animates the Nokia,</v>

1013
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:05.580
<v Speaker 1>so Japan creates them and then sets up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wish for his independence.</v>

1014
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And then nature appears in the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy and and grants that wish.</v>

1015
00:58:10.171 --> 00:58:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So you have culture and nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiring to produce.</v>

1016
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a puppet that could in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>disentangle itself from its strength,</v>

1017
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but the movie insists and it does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>on profound mythological grounds that </v>

1018
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the puppet itself has a causal role to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in it's own,</v>

1019
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call its own capacity to </v>

1020
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.870
<v Speaker 1>transcend the deterministic change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being,</v>

1021
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:37.230
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have the deterministic processes </v>

1022
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.250
<v Speaker 1>that have given rise to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also enslaved it and you know,</v>

1023
00:58:38.251 --> 00:58:38.670
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1024
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.610
<v Speaker 1>in all of our profound narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1025
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:47.030
<v Speaker 1>and this is part of the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ from the standard scientific </v>

1026
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.030
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always that third element.</v>

1027
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:50.580
<v Speaker 1>There's always the autonomous individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is in some sense,</v>

1028
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting himself up by his own bootstraps</v>

1029
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it's a problem that </v>

1030
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.521
<v Speaker 1>science is unable to account for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very big problem with </v>

1031
00:59:01.521 --> 00:59:06.351
<v Speaker 1>scientists who are unable to account for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that deny that it exists because they </v>

1032
00:59:06.351 --> 00:59:09.150
<v Speaker 1>can't explain it then becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dangerous,</v>

1033
00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:09.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1034
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Once you stop looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1035
00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:14.740
<v Speaker 2>you stopped crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1036
00:59:14.741 --> 00:59:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Then you're left with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an impoverished account.</v>

1037
00:59:17.571 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of Hubris right?</v>

1038
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Built into the skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1039
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.640
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1040
00:59:23.641 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I know that this is a problem that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just can't solve that,</v>

1041
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm not going to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try anymore.</v>

1042
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:35.140
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a performative contradiction as </v>

1043
00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:35.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is much worth pointing out because</v>

1044
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.040
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientists might well claim as far </v>

1045
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.330
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned from an epistomological</v>
<v Speaker 1>person perspective,</v>

1046
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the only two causal forces are nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture,</v>

1047
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but then I'll go about my actions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal world as an existential being,</v>

1048
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:56.910
<v Speaker 1>acting in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will swallow whole heartedly the </v>

1049
00:59:56.910 --> 01:00:00.451
<v Speaker 1>proposition that each individual is </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for his own actions because </v>

1050
01:00:00.451 --> 01:00:04.381
<v Speaker 1>that's how I constantly interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the world and I get very </v>

1051
01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:04.810
<v Speaker 1>irritated if they violate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>

1052
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how you live,</v>

1053
01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:13.641
<v Speaker 2>so to speak with your skepticism or with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your relativism in a way that doesn't </v>

1054
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:14.760
<v Speaker 2>mean snarl you in the countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradictions.</v>

1055
01:00:14.761 --> 01:00:16.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard contract itself.</v>

1056
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does seem to be that I think it's </v>

1057
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.851
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to point out that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to find a person who acts as if</v>

1058
01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>he or anyone else is biologically are </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally determined.</v>

1059
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>We just don't behave that way in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>

1060
01:00:33.271 --> 01:00:38.271
<v Speaker 1>We act as if we're responsible for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own actions and the consequences of </v>

1061
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:38.271
<v Speaker 1>those actions.</v>

1062
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>So then we have a tension between what </v>
<v Speaker 2>our intellectual theories,</v>

1063
01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>right are telling us and what are kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of empirical data,</v>

1064
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 2>right was telling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't yet have a way to put those </v>

1065
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.320
<v Speaker 2>two together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what you as an individual do in</v>

1066
01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:55.170
<v Speaker 2>response to that tension between theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and practice.</v>

1067
01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other can of things to </v>

1068
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1069
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:03.210
<v Speaker 2>To get the backup to our discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about power.</v>

1070
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that the way our </v>

1071
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.450
<v Speaker 2>discussion right up to that point then </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrates,</v>

1072
01:01:09.451 --> 01:01:11.940
<v Speaker 2>right free thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we started talking about proof,</v>

1073
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we started talking about goals </v>

1074
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>and normative ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in ideals.</v>

1075
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And then we talk about power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was already the big three </v>

1076
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.570
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ideals,</v>

1077
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:31.230
<v Speaker 2>right and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discussion about truth right?</v>

1078
01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Took us into a logical issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in philosophy,</v>

1079
01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.900
<v Speaker 2>our discussion about ideals that takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>us into ethics and ethics issues.</v>

1080
01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also in philosophy or discussion of </v>

1081
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:44.940
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1082
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Takes us in to issues about human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

1083
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 2>which traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a branch of philosophy now,</v>

1084
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>smarter sub disciplines were doing so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>already have to have a theory of </v>

1085
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>epistemology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory of human nature,</v>

1086
01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>a theory of efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we sometimes try to integrate those </v>

1087
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.650
<v Speaker 2>and postmodernism is going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration,</v>

1088
01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:09.690
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of certain views that develop in </v>

1089
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:13.140
<v Speaker 2>divisions in all three of those areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe one way to put it is this,</v>

1090
01:02:13.141 --> 01:02:18.141
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you contrast it to again taking white</v>

1091
01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:24.431
<v Speaker 2>moment as our touchstone a since we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>both fans of the enlightenment because </v>

1092
01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>they were fine with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with power,</v>

1093
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 2>like knowledge is power and we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>empower the individual,</v>

1094
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to eliminate slavery and </v>

1095
01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.791
<v Speaker 2>empower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to eliminate or fashion </v>

1096
01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 2>sexism and empower women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So power.</v>

1097
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually want to remove arbitrary and</v>

1098
01:02:45.981 --> 01:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary impediments to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

1099
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proper power.</v>

1100
01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>That's so there are legitimate uses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power that are stopping and disempower </v>

1101
01:02:56.141 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 2>and right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the double edge sword,</v>

1102
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as long as power is properly </v>

1103
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:06.501
<v Speaker 2>directed or properly located,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right then we are confident that by and </v>

1104
01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:11.271
<v Speaker 2>large people individually and socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll use their power to put together </v>

1105
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:16.311
<v Speaker 2>useful lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build a successful economies and </v>

1106
01:03:16.311 --> 01:03:20.271
<v Speaker 2>societies and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was actually a very optimistic </v>

1107
01:03:20.271 --> 01:03:21.470
<v Speaker 2>right overall assessment about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1108
01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about power,</v>

1109
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:27.870
<v Speaker 2>but power right is then structured as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>means to an end.</v>

1110
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And we want to empower people </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitively teach them how to read,</v>

1111
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>teach them how to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1112
01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 2>so that they themselves can understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and discover new truth.</v>

1113
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:45.410
<v Speaker 2>But so power leads to true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also then want people to be free </v>

1114
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1115
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:49.920
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1116
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:50.620
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1117
01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 2>to act on the basis of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their power.</v>

1118
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Because then we think that if people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>respected as individual agents are going</v>

1119
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 2>to be happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1120
01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:03.760
<v Speaker 2>and so they will achieve good goals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they will mute workout,</v>

1121
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.660
<v Speaker 2>share together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair will,</v>

1122
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements and deals,</v>

1123
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:13.020
<v Speaker 2>a kind of justice will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the society will get better and better </v>

1124
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.870
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So power is in the service of just </v>

1125
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>social relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And powers in the service of truth.</v>

1126
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great,</v>

1127
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a great justification for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment viewpoint.</v>

1128
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:34.071
<v Speaker 1>And it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to stop you from pursuing </v>

1129
01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:36.831
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems to me that to the </v>

1130
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:39.870
<v Speaker 1>degree that that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a valid description of the enlightenment</v>

1131
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:44.871
<v Speaker 1>aims and to the degree that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually manifested itself in reality in</v>

1132
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the current state of human affairs,</v>

1133
01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:52.191
<v Speaker 1>that it's perhaps unwise of us to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>our Marxist or are Nietzschean </v>

1134
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.720
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1135
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>take two careless to swing at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

1136
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Given that it's actually okay.</v>

1137
01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the enlightenment </v>

1138
01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 2>articulation power is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's in the service of proof,</v>

1139
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or power is good.</v>

1140
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.830
<v Speaker 2>If it's in the service of justice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were fine and we're optimistic </v>

1141
01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 2>enough about human beings cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 2>and morally,</v>

1142
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 2>that we think empowering them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them lots of freedoms is going to</v>

1143
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.440
<v Speaker 2>increase the net stocker approved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to increase the net stocker </v>

1144
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.190
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that entire enlightenment package is </v>

1145
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.461
<v Speaker 2>precisely what the counter enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks and attack very fundamentally.</v>

1146
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:41.700
<v Speaker 2>So that by the time we get to two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three generations later to the </v>

1147
01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.050
<v Speaker 2>generations of marks and eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been hollowed out.</v>

1148
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>So on the epistomological side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1149
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1150
01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.820
<v Speaker 2>that there is such a thing as true </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1151
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's not the case that power is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the search for truth because we don't </v>

1152
01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:00.901
<v Speaker 2>believe that human beings are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting any sort of objective proof </v>

1153
01:06:00.901 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're just left with power.</v>

1154
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:08.250
<v Speaker 2>And also on the normative side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't believe in dressed us right </v>

1155
01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:12.210
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe that any sort of </v>

1156
01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>normative principles or ethical ideals </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be objective.</v>

1157
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 2>We ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then once again,</v>

1158
01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're left with subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>designers,</v>

1159
01:06:19.371 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so forth.</v>

1160
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>But we're just left again with power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Howard,</v>

1161
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 2>service approved power in the service of</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice that goes away.</v>

1162
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.940
<v Speaker 2>All we are left with is power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1163
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Well we could mount a psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique of that set of objections </v>

1164
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>because I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1165
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 1>here's some reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

1166
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.780
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that you're doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple</v>

1167
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>and and</v>

1168
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>let's assume you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple and easy instead of complicated </v>

1169
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:56.111
<v Speaker 1>and difficult with your objections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here's the simple and easy </v>

1170
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:59.681
<v Speaker 1>explanation you want to dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of justice and truth because </v>

1171
01:07:00.471 --> 01:07:05.471
<v Speaker 1>that lightens your existential lobe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now there's nothing difficult </v>

1172
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:08.921
<v Speaker 1>and noble that you have to strive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to reduce everything to </v>

1173
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>power because that justifies your use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power in the pursuit of your immediate,</v>

1174
01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>in pursuit of those immediate goals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you no longer even have to justify it </v>

1175
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.881
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to make reference</v>
<v Speaker 1>to any higher standards of justice or </v>

1176
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:26.081
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say that's a deep </v>

1177
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and resentful nihilism that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself as a glorious </v>

1178
01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>intellectual critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm understanding as well that there</v>

1179
01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>is the history of genuine intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique that you'd be laying out,</v>

1180
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>which is not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those things have to be </v>

1181
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1182
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not reasonable either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those who claim that all there is is</v>

1183
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not themselves motivated </v>

1184
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 1>equally by that power.</v>

1185
01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.700
<v Speaker 2>So in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1186
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.430
<v Speaker 2>What you could always say in the tech </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is autobiographical,</v>

1187
01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.520
<v Speaker 2>in many cases were philosophers will put</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pronouncements in bird person </v>

1188
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.630
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't generalize form,</v>

1189
01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:10.631
<v Speaker 2>but if you always put it down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power or sort of person formulations </v>

1190
01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:13.280
<v Speaker 2>that can be profoundly self regulatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1191
01:08:13.281 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are Scamo,</v>

1192
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:22.660
<v Speaker 2>where then you have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic already assessment of the </v>

1193
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 2>human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a well built into that.</v>

1194
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Then as the idea that I think if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally I am scum,</v>

1195
01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 2>we're really doing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1196
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>is a first person confession and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>always done in a legitimate move to </v>

1197
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.960
<v Speaker 2>exempt yourself from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the general principle,</v>

1198
01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:41.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything just is to come back.</v>

1199
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>You are more likely topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your power relations and people imposing</v>

1200
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 2>their agendas on other people than what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying is,</v>

1201
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:52.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fundamental commitment is power and I</v>

1202
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>just want to impose my agenda on other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1203
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think you're right that it can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>both ways.</v>

1204
01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:00.530
<v Speaker 2>It can of course be that you have people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1205
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:05.240
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a predisposition to nihilistic,</v>

1206
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:09.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more power seating and they,</v>

1207
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 2>when they become adults and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual,</v>

1208
01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 2>they latch onto theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1209
01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that in indulgent that enabled them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalize their predispositions.</v>

1210
01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in many cases you are a lot of </v>

1211
01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:26.390
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism in some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations is disingenuous,</v>

1212
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:31.391
<v Speaker 2>right in that form that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily buy into the postmodern </v>

1213
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:36.140
<v Speaker 2>philosophical framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather in kind of pragmatic form,</v>

1214
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.160
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism as a set of tools is </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful for them to advance their own </v>

1215
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:47.891
<v Speaker 2>personal and social agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever those happen to be because </v>

1216
01:09:47.891 --> 01:09:47.891
<v Speaker 2>they find it.</v>

1217
01:09:47.891 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's switch a little bit.</v>

1218
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's switch over into that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1219
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And I found our discussion for what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth,</v>

1220
01:09:54.981 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I found her discussion extremely useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the philosophical and,</v>

1221
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but now I would like to make it a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more personal.</v>

1222
01:10:01.221 --> 01:10:02.600
<v Speaker 1>So now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind,</v>

1223
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you've written this book and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly punchy but say critique of </v>

1224
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.600
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and its alliance with neo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and,</v>

1225
01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and you've done a careful job of laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the historical development of that,</v>

1226
01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:21.230
<v Speaker 1>have both of those movements and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance.</v>

1227
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1228
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>what was your motivation for doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what do you,</v>

1229
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 1>what have you experienced one as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of writing the book and to,</v>

1230
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:36.980
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of a professor who's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the midst of a,</v>

1231
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>of an academic society that's basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>running on postmodern principles?</v>

1232
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good trio of questions there.</v>

1233
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.070
<v Speaker 2>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my motivation for writing the book was a</v>

1234
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.410
<v Speaker 2>motivations plural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A one is an intellectual exercise.</v>

1235
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.500
<v Speaker 2>A year was a movement that was complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many philosophical and cultural screens </v>

1236
01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:06.511
<v Speaker 2>were coming together and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy the intellectual history very </v>

1237
01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:09.200
<v Speaker 2>much so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a pleasure for me to,</v>

1238
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:14.650
<v Speaker 2>to read back into the histories and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese out over the lines of and how </v>

1239
01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>things were packaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be packaged.</v>

1240
01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the postmodern synthesis right </v>

1241
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>as it came together in the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

1242
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>third and 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1243
01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:28.060
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came into being as a,</v>

1244
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 2>as a purely intellectual historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise,</v>

1245
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.260
<v Speaker 2>found that fulfilling a partly also this</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a 19,</v>

1246
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:38.760
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late 19 nineties.</v>

1247
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>It's end of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1248
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:46.281
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not professionally but just out of </v>

1249
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 2>personal interest was read a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political philosophy,</v>

1250
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>read a lot about the Cold War and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual developments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>political developments that have gone on</v>

1252
01:11:56.051 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1253
01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So I had a very good say amateur working</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge before I started researching </v>

1254
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:06.291
<v Speaker 2>the book about the history of Marxism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and history of the Cold War geopolitics </v>

1255
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:13.670
<v Speaker 2>and sort of one of the big questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on everyone's mind person in </v>

1256
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the 19 nineties with the fall of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union.</v>

1257
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:17.880
<v Speaker 2>The end of the Cold War is what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen next,</v>

1258
01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the new geo political </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment going to be.</v>

1259
01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.640
<v Speaker 2>But then from my academic position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1260
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 2>the big question inside the intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is since far left politics had </v>

1261
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.440
<v Speaker 2>been so prominent and that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations,</v>

1262
01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:42.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intellectuals inside the academic world </v>

1263
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>at large will given the benefit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt too far,</v>

1264
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:48.291
<v Speaker 2>leftists experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even going out of the way to be fellow </v>

1265
01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:50.670
<v Speaker 2>travelers and so forth that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1266
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 2>by the time you get to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold war,</v>

1267
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:57.831
<v Speaker 2>basically everybody except for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>true believers is rethinking.</v>

1268
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does this mean for not </v>

1269
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.700
<v Speaker 2>necessarily left politics more broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly for our lab by politics.</v>

1270
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so even the far right of the </v>

1271
01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:15.831
<v Speaker 2>leftists are recognizing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to come up with some sort </v>

1272
01:13:15.831 --> 01:13:19.311
<v Speaker 2>of a new strategy in order to remain </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually respectable and some sort</v>

1273
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:25.371
<v Speaker 2>of a new strategy in order to become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally and politically feasible.</v>

1274
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:31.580
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't have a kind of a cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political interest in what the thinking </v>

1275
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:37.221
<v Speaker 2>was on the far left about what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do now that the Soviet Union </v>

1276
01:13:38.461 --> 01:13:43.461
<v Speaker 2>has collapsed and the whole world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting more toward market liberalism </v>

1277
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:48.771
<v Speaker 2>or to some sort of third way central is </v>
<v Speaker 2>loaded up on the beach.</v>

1278
01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:54.561
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a huge amount of empirical </v>

1279
01:13:54.561 --> 01:13:58.030
<v Speaker 2>data that you have to confront and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1280
01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:03.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is certainly going to be </v>

1281
01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:04.521
<v Speaker 2>part of the postmodern package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of denial of the </v>

1282
01:14:04.521 --> 01:14:07.190
<v Speaker 2>relevance of Empiricism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of denial of the,</v>

1283
01:14:07.191 --> 01:14:12.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relevance of logic and social </v>

1284
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:14.721
<v Speaker 2>scientific statistical methods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggregating that data and which normally</v>

1285
01:14:14.861 --> 01:14:19.861
<v Speaker 2>the conclusions on the basis of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can understand the temptation on </v>

1286
01:14:19.861 --> 01:14:24.181
<v Speaker 2>the part of a lot of people to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological devices that will enable </v>

1287
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 2>them to deny the gulag and various other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things</v>

1288
01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.040
<v Speaker 1>either are stacked viciously and get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts as even you would constrain them.</v>

1289
01:14:38.131 --> 01:14:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Are Stacking officiously in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction to your theory.</v>

1290
01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It's time to mount an all out assault on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes a fact.</v>

1291
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.870
<v Speaker 1>One strategy,</v>

1292
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.940
<v Speaker 2>and that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the sub strategies,</v>

1293
01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that postmodern postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>

1294
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.840
<v Speaker 2>so if you then have a loss suffers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>social scientists and the people who are</v>

1295
01:14:57.981 --> 01:15:02.960
<v Speaker 2>up to speed in their epistemology who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are telling you well know there are just</v>

1296
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:08.030
<v Speaker 2>know different narratives that are out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and there are no such things as </v>

1297
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:11.240
<v Speaker 2>objective facts and logic was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily pointing in one direction.</v>

1298
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.360
<v Speaker 2>There are poly logics or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1299
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 2>or multiple frameworks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

1300
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have one framework that says no,</v>

1301
01:15:17.841 --> 01:15:19.830
<v Speaker 2>there are objective facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1302
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the logic is all going against your,</v>

1303
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:27.830
<v Speaker 2>your version of political idealism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to be very tempting for you to say,</v>

1304
01:15:27.921 --> 01:15:32.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just dismiss that as just one </v>

1305
01:15:32.921 --> 01:15:33.350
<v Speaker 2>narrative way of constructing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical facts.</v>

1306
01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I can come up with a different narrative</v>
<v Speaker 2>that softens organized like all together</v>

1307
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 2>and certainly some of the bad faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist who go down that road like</v>

1308
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.790
<v Speaker 2>very much so.</v>

1309
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:48.200
<v Speaker 2>In part that was my motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing the book part.</v>

1310
01:15:48.201 --> 01:15:53.201
<v Speaker 2>I did feel that I was in a good position</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually to do so because my,</v>

1311
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.670
<v Speaker 2>my phd work had been in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in logic,</v>

1312
01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:03.671
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of science systemology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was up to speed on the entire </v>

1313
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 2>history of a log from the modern world </v>
<v Speaker 2>on blue things are the way things were </v>

1314
01:16:09.891 --> 01:16:14.891
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties and early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was reading the same people that </v>

1315
01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:20.141
<v Speaker 2>were already had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say I've learned an enormous </v>

1316
01:16:20.141 --> 01:16:22.781
<v Speaker 2>amount from reading Richard Rorty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's first rate even though I ended up </v>

1317
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:26.140
<v Speaker 2>disagreeing fundamentally everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1318
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:31.370
<v Speaker 2>who goes phd also was in philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also a phd in psychology.</v>

1319
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>There's another philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phd Realtor,</v>

1320
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:40.190
<v Speaker 2>another philosophy phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not necessarily put myself on the </v>

1321
01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:42.350
<v Speaker 2>same stature right intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1322
01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:47.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the so to speak or first grade </v>

1323
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:47.740
<v Speaker 2>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any piss demolished,</v>

1324
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.540
<v Speaker 2>so I know where they're coming from and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where all of that is going at the same </v>

1325
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:52.730
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1326
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1327
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:58.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my undergraduate and master's degree at </v>

1328
01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just down the road from you,</v>

1329
01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:00.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1330
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.760
<v Speaker 2>in history of philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a long standing passion for how </v>

1331
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.300
<v Speaker 2>arguments and movements develop over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1332
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1333
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:10.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had,</v>

1334
01:17:10.731 --> 01:17:15.731
<v Speaker 2>it was in a good position to see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism have evolved out of </v>

1335
01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>various other earlier movements that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed over time and I am enough of a</v>

1336
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:25.121
<v Speaker 2>political animal to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>political philosophy and I believe that </v>

1337
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.050
<v Speaker 2>abstract philosophical theory when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it,</v>

1338
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:33.070
<v Speaker 2>gets put into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make life and death practical </v>

1339
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the stakes are high.</v>

1340
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was motivated then to put it all </v>

1341
01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.281
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the history and the philosophy </v>

1342
01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.050
<v Speaker 2>and the politics all come together in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1343
01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:47.610
<v Speaker 2>so I wrote the book now a yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How it has affected me personally in an </v>

1344
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 2>academic life.</v>

1345
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>

1346
01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:56.421
<v Speaker 2>I think in one way I think I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunate that I had tenure by the time </v>

1347
01:17:56.421 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 2>the book was published and my university</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a vital,</v>

1348
01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.570
<v Speaker 2>larger tolerant case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have some,</v>

1349
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.080
<v Speaker 2>some issues here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by and large my colleagues on a </v>

1350
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.890
<v Speaker 2>reasonable decent people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1351
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:14.180
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to get tenure on the strength</v>

1352
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 2>of my teaching abilities and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my publication.</v>

1353
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't that I was going to lose my</v>

1354
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 2>job right over this fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First areas,</v>

1355
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:30.850
<v Speaker 2>there's blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did have difficulty getting the book </v>

1356
01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:33.161
<v Speaker 2>published right in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I finished writing the book by </v>

1357
01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had taken a sabbatical from 1999 to </v>

1358
01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 2>2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not able to get the book published</v>

1359
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:45.401
<v Speaker 2>until 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a reason for that was a number of </v>

1360
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 2>desk rejections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1361
01:18:49.551 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 2>the editor sends a form letter back for </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few of those,</v>

1362
01:18:53.301 --> 01:18:55.760
<v Speaker 2>but more seriously what happened three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

1363
01:18:55.761 --> 01:19:00.761
<v Speaker 2>possibly four times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember exactly now was that </v>

1364
01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:00.761
<v Speaker 2>would get past the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1365
01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:05.141
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the editor at the press and then it </v>

1366
01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:05.240
<v Speaker 2>really sent out to two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewers.</v>

1367
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:10.750
<v Speaker 2>And in each case what happened was I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get split and poor I slipped a </v>

1368
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.820
<v Speaker 2>review for at one would come back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1369
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:15.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a really good book.</v>

1370
01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 2>You've done his homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good argument,</v>

1371
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 2>is a fresh argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't necessarily agree with all of it,</v>

1372
01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>but this really ought to be out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>right as a book.</v>

1373
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.920
<v Speaker 2>And then the other review or the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>two reviews on the other side would be a</v>

1374
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:33.970
<v Speaker 2>equally savaging at this terrible book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he doesn't know his history of </v>

1375
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.810
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He butchered the sat or act or the other</v>

1376
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:39.070
<v Speaker 2>thing and I strongly recommend that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like publishes books.</v>

1377
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And then almost always in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

1378
01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:42.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1379
01:19:42.161 --> 01:19:47.161
<v Speaker 2>the editor just said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't until 2000 and I guess late</v>

1380
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:52.660
<v Speaker 2>2003 a or few thousand for a scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ged,</v>

1381
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 2>which was at a small press working out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Arizona,</v>

1382
01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the book on.</v>

1383
01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.160
<v Speaker 2>And I'm happy to say that to accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

1384
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:04.930
<v Speaker 2>It's an imprint consistently since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remarkable.</v>

1385
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Just remarkable how many book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone an academic book and then </v>

1386
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.520
<v Speaker 2>multiple translations and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue.</v>

1387
01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:13.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1388
01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.820
<v Speaker 2>so I'm happy about that now to say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholar and the responses have been from</v>

1389
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:27.460
<v Speaker 2>the moderate liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also kind of traditional the one who </v>

1390
01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.950
<v Speaker 2>used the word necessarily traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rational,</v>

1391
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 2>naturalistic liberal right thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1392
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.090
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and libertarians that </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviews have all been strong,</v>

1393
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.140
<v Speaker 2>strongly positive or not received any </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal reviews from any of the </v>

1394
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:47.990
<v Speaker 2>postmodern for or far left journals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure what that means,</v>

1395
01:20:50.071 --> 01:20:55.071
<v Speaker 2>but there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least some level of unwillingness to </v>

1396
01:20:55.071 --> 01:20:57.020
<v Speaker 2>engage with might be a sign of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1397
01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:00.180
<v Speaker 2>there is one sign of respect that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and that is that every,</v>

1398
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 2>let's say once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so probably a dozen times since the book</v>

1399
01:21:03.751 --> 01:21:08.751
<v Speaker 2>has been published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been asked by the editor of a </v>

1400
01:21:08.751 --> 01:21:12.950
<v Speaker 2>postmodern foreclose fellow traveler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a critical theory type of journal to be </v>

1401
01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.690
<v Speaker 2>a second reviewer right on one of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles.</v>

1402
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in their Rolodex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1403
01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.640
<v Speaker 2>We use the old fashioned label has that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they are actually looking for </v>

1404
01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.461
<v Speaker 2>someone who's likely to give an </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective but critical respect </v>

1405
01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:32.090
<v Speaker 2>perspective on some articles to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>submitted to the journal once in a while</v>

1406
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 2>my name floats up and they'll send it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to me.</v>

1407
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:37.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just do the standard thing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading it and getting my mindset,</v>

1408
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 2>my professional opinion on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think when they are aware of me,</v>

1409
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 2>but there hasn't really been any direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual engagement.</v>

1410
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Kind of sad.</v>

1411
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:50.750
<v Speaker 1>When you set yourself up to write the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

1412
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:55.400
<v Speaker 1>were you thinking of writing a critique </v>
<v Speaker 1>of postmodernism or,</v>

1413
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:59.570
<v Speaker 1>or were you thinking of conducting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of postmodernism?</v>

1414
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm working on the critique or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1415
01:22:03.231 --> 01:22:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the book ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1416
01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say abruptly because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did set out the purpose of.</v>

1417
01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't end with the door open,</v>

1418
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:14.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To say how then do we respond to a,</v>

1419
01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:19.620
<v Speaker 2>this is this dead end of counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment thought or in </v>

1420
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:20.790
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're at a point culture.</v>

1421
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.820
<v Speaker 2>We were that the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism has now it's infected the </v>

1422
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.140
<v Speaker 2>academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see problems there,</v>

1423
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's also left the academy and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people outside the academy are </v>

1424
01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:34.830
<v Speaker 2>seeing results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the big question is what do we do</v>

1425
01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1426
01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.270
<v Speaker 2>so I am actively working on the sequel </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1427
01:22:38.271 --> 01:22:40.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explaining postmodernism now.</v>

1428
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>And I did go back and forth in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

1429
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:49.070
<v Speaker 2>My first purpose was to write a straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis and intellectual history of </v>

1430
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:50.070
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism.</v>

1431
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I ended up leaving it </v>

1432
01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.990
<v Speaker 2>because in one sense this is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial,</v>

1433
01:22:57.991 --> 01:23:02.991
<v Speaker 2>but I really liked 200 page books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of long enough for you to </v>

1434
01:23:02.991 --> 01:23:07.731
<v Speaker 2>get into a subject deeply enough and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a good point in integrated argument</v>

1435
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:13.350
<v Speaker 2>and then stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I realized if I wrote the sequel </v>

1436
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:18.241
<v Speaker 2>then it would be a 400 page book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was more important to </v>

1437
01:23:18.241 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>get this self contained intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of postmodernism out there.</v>

1438
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:26.071
<v Speaker 2>So I brought things to a logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion right where I ended the book </v>

1439
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:28.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm working on</v>

1440
01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:34.440
<v Speaker 1>which the next one called just as a,</v>

1441
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the working title of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it changes every year,</v>

1442
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 2>every few months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1443
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1444
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:44.341
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fate of the enlightenment or </v>

1445
01:23:44.341 --> 01:23:45.490
<v Speaker 2>something to do with the neo </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

1446
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:49.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it won't be this,</v>

1447
01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 2>but post postmodernism or after </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism something.</v>

1448
01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been struggling with terminology </v>

1449
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1450
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Talking about with such things.</v>

1451
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very hard thing to do because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1452
01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen Phyllis philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1453
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Postmodernism is multidimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a metaphysical critique,</v>

1454
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:13.720
<v Speaker 2>it's informative critique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a political critique,</v>

1455
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 2>it's an epistemological right set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

1456
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.520
<v Speaker 2>And so the alternative then also has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be integrated philosophical.</v>

1457
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.530
<v Speaker 2>There has to be an entire prosoft </v>
<v Speaker 2>package.</v>

1458
01:24:22.531 --> 01:24:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1459
01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:27.190
<v Speaker 2>what label is going to capture all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1460
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:32.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the same time make a connection </v>

1461
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:33.650
<v Speaker 2>to postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

1462
01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:34.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1463
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically an optimistic positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1464
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>So I want something that,</v>

1465
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:42.620
<v Speaker 1>that has a as a way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:24:42.621 --> 01:24:43.490
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Make it a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1468
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1469
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1470
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an hour and a half interview is </v>

1471
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>approximately the equivalent of a 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>page book.</v>

1472
01:24:56.230 --> 01:25:01.230
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we end with that and what I </v>

1473
01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:04.931
<v Speaker 1>would like to propose is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>another discussion in a couple of months</v>

1474
01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.310
<v Speaker 1>about what you're thinking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to what you're writing.</v>

1475
01:25:10.311 --> 01:25:15.311
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've covered the intellectual </v>

1476
01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:18.551
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've covered the historical territory </v>

1477
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:18.551
<v Speaker 1>and done a reasonable reasonably good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

1478
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:23.111
<v Speaker 1>I think of both justifying posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism in this discussion and </v>

1479
01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:25.820
<v Speaker 1>also pointing out its pitfalls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers.</v>

1480
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 1>We haven't outlined a much for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative vision except making </v>

1481
01:25:33.351 --> 01:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>tangential reference to the potency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual capacity.</v>

1482
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would seem to be reasonable grounds</v>

1483
01:25:41.901 --> 01:25:43.550
<v Speaker 1>for the next discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1484
01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the next time we chat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right talking about the current culture </v>

1485
01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>war issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1486
01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:54.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I'm very interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>is younger people in particular who are </v>

1487
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:57.150
<v Speaker 2>in the front lines in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1488
01:25:57.151 --> 01:26:02.151
<v Speaker 2>and they're surrounded in a bewildered </v>
<v Speaker 2>and angry and in some cases intimidated </v>

1489
01:26:02.611 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>by all of</v>

1490
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 1>the microaggressions and so forth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the indoctrination of getting.</v>

1491
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:14.270
<v Speaker 1>But I'm actually kind of glad that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't talk about the political end of </v>

1492
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:17.921
<v Speaker 1>it today because it enabled us to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that was almost entirely </v>

1493
01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>philosophical in nature and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's the right,</v>

1494
01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the right level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the battle that's occurring in </v>

1495
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.661
<v Speaker 1>our culture is actually occurring at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical level and there's other </v>

1496
01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:28.661
<v Speaker 1>levels as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1497
01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:33.630
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even more important than the </v>

1498
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:33.630
<v Speaker 1>political level as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well said.</v>

1499
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100 percent nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1500
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Well it was a pleasure speaking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1501
01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:43.541
<v Speaker 1>Is very much worthwhile or do you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable capacity for tracking the </v>

1502
01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:48.101
<v Speaker 1>content of conversations and on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite amazing to see because </v>

1503
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:53.110
<v Speaker 1>we did branch out and a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions more or less similar </v>

1504
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:56.160
<v Speaker 1>caneously it was quite helpful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the chorus on track that you </v>

1505
01:26:56.661 --> 01:26:59.990
<v Speaker 1>could so rapidly organized the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1506
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like you're putting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph structure in the conversation,</v>

1507
01:27:02.811 --> 01:27:07.811
<v Speaker 1>ask occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was something that was really </v>

1508
01:27:07.811 --> 01:27:07.811
<v Speaker 1>interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1509
01:27:07.811 --> 01:27:11.891
<v Speaker 1>it was a pleasure meeting you and thanks</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much for talking with me and I'll </v>
