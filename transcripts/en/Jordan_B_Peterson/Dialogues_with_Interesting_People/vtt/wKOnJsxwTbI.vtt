1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it's looking good here today with Gregg </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurwitz,</v>

3
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 2>who's a novelist and a screenwriter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a comic book writer and a variety of </v>

4
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 2>other things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>his latest book,</v>

6
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the nowhere man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to talk to him </v>

7
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 2>about writing more generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the plan anyways.</v>

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

9
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you start by telling us a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about your new book and then </v>

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>about who you are.</v>

12
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my new book,</v>

13
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I started a new series with my last </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and usually I write standalone </v>

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 3>thrillers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my last book was based on,</v>

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I've sort of done a lot of really dumb </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in the name of research over the </v>

18
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've gone undercover to mind control </v>

19
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 3>bolts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone up and done airplanes,</v>

20
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I've snuck on a demolition ranges with </v>
<v Speaker 3>navy seals and blowing up cars.</v>

21
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that kept coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>up when I dealt with a lot of the SPEC </v>

22
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.221
<v Speaker 3>ops guys were how these off the books </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs were implemented over the </v>

23
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sort of history beneath the history </v>

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 3>that we're all aware of and I got really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in this and I thought about a</v>

25
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:28.411
<v Speaker 3>character who was taken out of foster </v>
<v Speaker 3>homes that the age of 12.</v>

26
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a program called the orphan </v>
<v Speaker 3>program and basically raised up to be </v>

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 3>assassins to be their full training.</v>

28
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 3>It's their full life and that's orphan </v>
<v Speaker 3>x.</v>

29
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the first book in the series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in the second book,</v>

30
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 3>the one that's just come out called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere man.</v>

31
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 3>This acid is taken by somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know who he is,</v>

32
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 3>but want something from him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken off and spirited off out to this </v>

33
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.121
<v Speaker 3>remote chateau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know where it is and the </v>

34
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.811
<v Speaker 3>people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no idea what his real identity is </v>

35
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.991
<v Speaker 3>or who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think that he's trapped in </v>

36
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.451
<v Speaker 3>there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact they're trapped in there </v>

37
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.391
<v Speaker 3>with him and they're soon going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that they have a major problem </v>

38
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.121
<v Speaker 3>on their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's the second and the folding </v>

39
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 3>out of this new character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is Evan Smoke.</v>

40
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 2>So this is the first time that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>written a series.</v>

41
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I know it's the second time you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>written a series,</v>

42
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

43
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard a series early in my career and </v>

44
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 3>then I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

45
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I went about nine books with Tiana loans</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I returned to wet.</v>

46
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 3>And part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes so long.</v>

47
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean the majority of my waking hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm spending inside of manuscripting </v>

48
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.681
<v Speaker 3>with a character like I spend more time </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my characters who were fictional </v>

49
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:42.341
<v Speaker 3>that I do with my wife and kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it took me years to find your </v>

50
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 3>characters or less complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually one of the themes of,</v>

51
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the books.</v>

52
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways in which,</v>

53
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:57.761
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the complications that arise from </v>

54
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.861
<v Speaker 3>intimacy because my character was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was raised with the veil of </v>

55
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 3>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

56
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the notions that I played with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

57
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 3>I came to when I was writing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Batman.</v>

58
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.221
<v Speaker 3>I wrote Batman Comics for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and there were some notions in </v>

59
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:11.221
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interest in me,</v>

60
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was the balance between </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfection and intimacy.</v>

61
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.260
<v Speaker 3>That was my main focus with Batman </v>
<v Speaker 3>because part of the reason why I liked </v>

62
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that man so much is you know he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a magic ring light green lantern.</v>

63
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:27.241
<v Speaker 3>He can't fly like superman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a human who represents the </v>

64
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle of what can be accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 3>through sheer discipline.</v>

65
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 3>But part of why that works is his </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents are dead.</v>

66
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 3>He's not married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has no kids.</v>

67
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 3>He lives up in Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Wayne Manor,</v>

68
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 3>and he's completely undisturbed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone and everything so we can hone </v>

69
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.271
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more that you let people into </v>

70
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:45.271
<v Speaker 3>your life and the more that you allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimacy in your life,</v>

71
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 3>the more complications come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of detract from this previous </v>

72
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 3>notion of perfection.</v>

73
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I've got a question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that seems to me to reflect in some </v>

74
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:03.031
<v Speaker 2>sense the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the different problems or maybe </v>

75
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 2>the different orientation of of men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

76
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible for men too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think many men can do this too,</v>

77
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>is to sacrifice everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including intimacy to become really good</v>

78
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 2>at one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas women,</v>

79
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course this is a broad </v>

80
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>generalization and one that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>undoubtedly get me in trouble,</v>

81
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 3>we would never get in trouble.</v>

82
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

83
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I know women are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more concerned with intimacy and</v>

84
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an interesting dichotomy that</v>

85
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you established between those two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>

86
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.111
<v Speaker 2>why you said that intimacy detracts from</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection because it's sort of,</v>

87
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.651
<v Speaker 2>it spreads you out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you come across that particular </v>

88
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:53.821
<v Speaker 2>paradox?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that one fascinates </v>

89
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:53.821
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

90
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

91
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm hyper</v>

92
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.990
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that I noticed is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's the thing,</v>

93
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:05.991
<v Speaker 4>when you find a character who you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to live with more than you do with your </v>

94
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:08.931
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to find something at the heart </v>

95
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:08.931
<v Speaker 4>of them that's uniquely compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>

96
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 4>I think I have.</v>

97
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 3>I have a strong perfectionist drive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've got when I was younger,</v>

98
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 3>it served me well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

99
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:20.551
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the traits that we have or </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative traits that might be survival </v>

100
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 3>instincts that got us through a key </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of our life,</v>

101
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're easy to discard when they're not</v>

102
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

103
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can have a bit of a temper,</v>

104
00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:34.181
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that are really hard or </v>

105
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:34.181
<v Speaker 3>adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

106
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 3>qualities that we have that have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>us very,</v>

107
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 3>very far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now we're starting to interfere with</v>

108
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:42.701
<v Speaker 3>our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that I noticed </v>

109
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 3>is that my drive for severe discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>and perfection,</v>

110
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is tough when you're married,</v>

111
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 3>when you have a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have two kids,</v>

112
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 3>when you have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're singularly focused,</v>

113
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:55.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's also not something that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer is to just give up completely,</v>

114
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

115
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's trying to find a of maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>the value and the drive and the </v>

116
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.711
<v Speaker 3>discipline that's necessary to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>novelist and a screenwriter and comp </v>

117
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 3>writer and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the exhibit discipline in other</v>

118
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:12.101
<v Speaker 3>areas of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while also a lab allowing for sort of </v>

119
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 3>the complications that come with </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimacy.</v>

120
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 3>And so with Evan Smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my main character,</v>

121
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:23.681
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole series coalesce around a </v>

122
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 3>certain exchange that he has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

123
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I did when I </v>

124
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 3>first was thinking about him being </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out,</v>

125
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.731
<v Speaker 3>he's this broke foster kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out of the projects in East </v>

126
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore at the age of 12 and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised only by handler.</v>

127
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 3>No one even knows who he is and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>codings or fanatics.</v>

128
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And I thought instead of making this the</v>
<v Speaker 3>usual Sabi backstory,</v>

129
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 3>what if that handler was a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally good man and became like a</v>

130
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 3>father figure and actually loved him.</v>

131
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And at one point Jack Johns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's his handler,</v>

132
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 3>tells him the heart when he's a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

133
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 3>the hard part is not going to be making </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a killer.</v>

134
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.830
<v Speaker 3>The hard part is gonna be keeping you </v>
<v Speaker 3>human and forever and the thing that </v>

135
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 3>stuck in my head was it would be so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier if he was just purely as an acid,</v>

136
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 3>if his moral compass was never broken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because of the way that he was </v>

137
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 3>raised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he at a certain point,</v>

138
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:15.371
<v Speaker 3>the ambiguity's of committee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these assassinations in different </v>

139
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:18.731
<v Speaker 3>territories where we're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be and he has limited information that </v>

140
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:22.120
<v Speaker 3>the moral ambiguity is become too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he leaves and become sort of a pro </v>

141
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 3>bono assassin for people in desperate </v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

142
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Like that's where we meet him in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>series and it's only because Jack had </v>

143
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.411
<v Speaker 3>gave him a human connection that opened </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the complexities that make this </v>

144
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 3>complicated for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

145
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 3>when I was writing the punisher is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marvel character.</v>

146
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.490
<v Speaker 3>That's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The punishers families,</v>

147
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 3>all dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just wants to kill everybody.</v>

148
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 3>He wants to punish everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With Evan,</v>

149
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:47.681
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing at the heart of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like he still has to function with </v>

150
00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>this humanity that was given to him from</v>
<v Speaker 3>his father figure.</v>

151
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

152
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that of the Batman movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Heath Ledger,</v>

153
00:07:55.511 --> 00:08:00.511
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie is that the joker accuses </v>

154
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Batman of being exactly the same as he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is fundamentally like there you could </v>

155
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>say opposite sides of the same coin or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even closer than that.</v>

156
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:13.050
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in what you're saying that </v>

157
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.750
<v Speaker 2>mitigates against the deadly danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even what you call it,</v>

158
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:21.751
<v Speaker 2>a psychopathic intensity of single </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindedness because one question you </v>

159
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 2>might ask yourself is that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

160
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 2>if intimacy interferes with perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why bother with it?</v>

161
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

162
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also like how do we widen out the </v>

163
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:34.470
<v Speaker 3>definition of perfection?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

164
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.531
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you take Bruce Wayne to his </v>

165
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:38.531
<v Speaker 3>logical end and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

166
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 3>killed a lot of bad guys and maintain </v>
<v Speaker 3>fit physical perfection,</v>

167
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dies alone in his manner is that </v>

168
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.001
<v Speaker 3>actually perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to broaden our definition </v>

169
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 3>of what you apply perfection to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

170
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I didn't</v>

171
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.980
<v Speaker 2>do as good a job of laying out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dichotomy in my earlier question.</v>

172
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I might've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things you mentioned was </v>

173
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.391
<v Speaker 2>that it was his presupposition that men </v>
<v Speaker 2>were after perfection and women were </v>

174
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:10.131
<v Speaker 2>after wholeness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a more inclusive than the issue </v>

175
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>with perfection is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's single minded,</v>

176
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that only focuses on,</v>

177
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.770
<v Speaker 2>let's say one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas wholeness seems to be something </v>

178
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 2>more like the balance between a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

179
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.890
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>positive and valuable things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't be perfect at a variety of</v>

181
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 2>useful and balanced are valuable at </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance things you have to settle for </v>

182
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe b plus at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a variety of them.</v>

183
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 2>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the totality ethan more valuable than</v>

184
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.831
<v Speaker 2>perfection along one axis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose it depends on the </v>

185
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:42.831
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

186
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.870
<v Speaker 2>but obviously that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're continually toying with and you </v>

187
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 2>said it because it reflects a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation in your own life and with your</v>

188
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 2>own character.</v>

189
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

190
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you've managed to integrate intimacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>into your life.</v>

191
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 2>And so what's been the advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

192
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the advantage is it's,</v>

193
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the things that give that </v>

194
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.160
<v Speaker 3>ultimately give I think pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning to life come from intimacy.</v>

195
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that thing,</v>

196
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's the old saw that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say when people die,</v>

197
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.130
<v Speaker 3>it's rare that they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

198
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:23.131
<v Speaker 3>I wish I worked more in regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the work is versus spending time </v>

199
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:26.941
<v Speaker 3>with your family and with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I've noticed increasingly </v>

200
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:30.421
<v Speaker 3>as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a shift in priorities and </v>

201
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it stills one that's,</v>

202
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me at times because I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get single minded.</v>

203
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can get hypo manic when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

204
00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:42.241
<v Speaker 3>I write generally 10 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've written as much as 23 hours </v>

205
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.000
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:48.001
<v Speaker 3>when I was on a TV show that was a risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>of shutting down and we needed a script </v>

207
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 3>and there's just not a choice for it.</v>

208
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 3>So I can get incredibly focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the more focused that that I get </v>

209
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 3>with writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you're doing with</v>

210
00:10:55.451 --> 00:11:00.451
<v Speaker 3>writing when you're in a venture that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult is you have a very high error </v>

211
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 3>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

212
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.610
<v Speaker 3>alarm system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

213
00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:08.611
<v Speaker 3>That's cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not gonna work that's been seen </v>

214
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:10.891
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to do something that's new </v>

215
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:10.891
<v Speaker 3>and if you're in a field that's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's turned up really high,</v>

216
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 3>well that can make living with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really difficult or interacting with </v>

217
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.030
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very effective for work to say,</v>

218
00:11:16.031 --> 00:11:21.031
<v Speaker 3>how do I make everything better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's everything that's wrong with </v>

219
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:23.971
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of an approach to a </v>

220
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.381
<v Speaker 3>manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work as well if you have </v>

221
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:28.321
<v Speaker 3>a two year old or a five year old at </v>
<v Speaker 3>home where you're trying to to to deal </v>

222
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:28.720
<v Speaker 3>with something else and you can also </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose perspective.</v>

223
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a single mindedness to the range</v>

224
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.510
<v Speaker 3>of perfection that you can lose things </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the periphery.</v>

225
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.500
<v Speaker 3>So like having some pe pluses and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>arenas I think are better.</v>

226
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one of the things what </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships are good for is literally </v>

227
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.260
<v Speaker 3>providing perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we always say that,</v>

228
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend gave me a good perspective,</v>

229
00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's like there's somebody literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside you looking at you aware of what</v>

230
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 3>your blind spots are aware of the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing wrong,</v>

231
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:58.801
<v Speaker 3>but we just can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the intimacy is </v>

232
00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 3>immensely useful is it's like you can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>on perfection and just tell often,</v>

233
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.701
<v Speaker 3>but wilderness and be gone if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have other people looking at you and </v>

234
00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 3>keeping you human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

235
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 3>And so it's.</v>

236
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

237
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that's actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that I've been making up here </v>

238
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.231
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the necessity of freedom of speech </v>

239
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.171
<v Speaker 2>is that it isn't so much that you get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say what you think and be right.</v>

240
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 2>It's that you get to say what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be exposed to the corrective views </v>

241
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.251
<v Speaker 2>of other people and they have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and right with regards to</v>

242
00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.710
<v Speaker 2>their own speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to say what they think,</v>

243
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:38.711
<v Speaker 2>but they have to be open to corrective </v>
<v Speaker 2>input from other people.</v>

244
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

245
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible.</v>

246
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Like if we want to evolve into a society</v>
<v Speaker 3>where if you misspeak,</v>

247
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.880
<v Speaker 3>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a Saturday night live writer </v>

248
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.770
<v Speaker 3>who made it a tweet that was denigrating</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barron trump,</v>

249
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she ultimately regretted it,</v>

250
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she apologized.</v>

251
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sign out,</v>

252
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 3>live kind of a suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are either suspended her or let her go,</v>

253
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 3>suspended her indefinitely and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this interesting question of </v>

254
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a comedian and your job </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be funny,</v>

255
00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:16.431
<v Speaker 3>being funny revolves on being a reverend</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on being surprised and you're the </v>

256
00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:20.601
<v Speaker 3>court jester in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go too far sometimes in </v>

257
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>order to do your job properly and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's three times out of 10.</v>

258
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.540
<v Speaker 3>So she said something that she believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she went too far and she apologized</v>

259
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:32.541
<v Speaker 3>for us and we've gotten into this place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people don't accept apologies </v>

260
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:32.541
<v Speaker 3>anymore</v>

261
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

262
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks to me like we've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where if you,</v>

263
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.050
<v Speaker 2>if you make an apology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people regard that as a final proof of </v>

264
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 2>your guilt.</v>

265
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which it.</v>

266
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it encourages a lack of insight</v>

267
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:51.090
<v Speaker 3>and apology from people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly rise in power.</v>

268
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.090
<v Speaker 3>But the thing for me that so interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's like when I write,</v>

269
00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 3>I give myself permission to write a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vomit draft of a book.</v>

270
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I talked to so many aspiring writers who</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

271
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I sit down and I just walk up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write a paragraph and then I don't </v>

272
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.031
<v Speaker 3>know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've conversation after conversation </v>

273
00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:10.131
<v Speaker 3>with people and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be afraid to make mistakes and </v>

274
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 3>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot fix a blank page.</v>

275
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Get something down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call it the vomit draft and then you </v>

276
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.271
<v Speaker 3>can fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we're losing that ability in </v>

277
00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:23.391
<v Speaker 3>speech like everyone has to speak like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Winston Churchill upon first pass </v>

278
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 3>everyone else a perfectly constructed </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences perfectly regarding thought.</v>

279
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.240
<v Speaker 3>We're going to lose our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact in ways that are meaningful to </v>

280
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.600
<v Speaker 3>stop and pause and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right that,</v>

281
00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 3>that did go too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me back off.</v>

282
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Students,</v>

283
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.420
<v Speaker 2>my graduate students and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduates as well to write a really</v>

284
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 2>bad first draft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also tell them,</v>

285
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you can't play around with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't pretend that you're going</v>

286
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:52.270
<v Speaker 2>to write a really bad first draft and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>

287
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.340
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>break the rules of that game and rights </v>

288
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 2>and tried to write something good </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways because that doesn't work.</v>

289
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:04.151
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't free you up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them that at the same time if </v>

290
00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:08.621
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to write a 2000 word </v>
<v Speaker 2>essay to write a really bad 3000 word </v>

291
00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:12.521
<v Speaker 2>essay or 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>word essay so that they can feel </v>

292
00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:14.130
<v Speaker 2>comfortable throwing away 50 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and</v>

293
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.430
<v Speaker 3>amazing how you get to good through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

294
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of times I sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

295
00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:23.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're not feeling it,</v>

296
00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:25.140
<v Speaker 3>and if I just start writing at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

297
00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:27.090
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like if you set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tell young,</v>

298
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 3>younger writers set time that you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sap percent.</v>

299
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.870
<v Speaker 3>You know that as above all else that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

300
00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if it's an hour twice a week,</v>

301
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 3>at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hit the hour mark and </v>

302
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.100
<v Speaker 3>realize that you're at an hour and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half years at an hour and 45 minutes.</v>

303
00:15:41.101 --> 00:15:46.101
<v Speaker 3>It leads to more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're willing to write into </v>

304
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and errors and not be overly </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with,</v>

305
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everything is an impeccable he </v>

306
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 3>detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will get to stuff that's better.</v>

307
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point you'll start doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>real writing.</v>

308
00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:59.310
<v Speaker 3>The language will start to actually be </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive as opposed to dad.</v>

309
00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:00.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to access it.</v>

310
00:16:00.931 --> 00:16:05.931
<v Speaker 3>It's like a warm up jogging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a warm up clamp on a track before you </v>

311
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.290
<v Speaker 3>sprint and we need to be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

312
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

313
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you have to push yourself out to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where you're actually making </v>

314
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.581
<v Speaker 2>errors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about comedians and it </v>

315
00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:19.030
<v Speaker 2>seems to me that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're exploring a set of new ideas,</v>

316
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:21.370
<v Speaker 2>instead of just writing down what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>already know,</v>

317
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Speaker 2>which would sort of be like imitating </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or parodying yourself,</v>

318
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you have to push yourself past what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>already know.</v>

319
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing that,</v>

320
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not doing that,</v>

321
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:38.821
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's creative and </v>

322
00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:38.821
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there is some kind of,</v>

323
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:45.130
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is some kind of optimal ratio </v>

324
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.061
<v Speaker 3>of error to creative thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that there was a good study </v>

325
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 3>done about relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

326
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.890
<v Speaker 2>and their longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one question might be,</v>

327
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>how many positive interactions compared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to negative interactions do you have to </v>

328
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.101
<v Speaker 2>have an order for a relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain itself stably across time and </v>

329
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

330
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.100
<v Speaker 2>the higher the positive to the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>

331
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't how it turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out that five positive to one </v>

332
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.530
<v Speaker 2>negative interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking was the lower bound.</v>

333
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.780
<v Speaker 2>If it got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the negative,</v>

334
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.840
<v Speaker 2>if the ratio God lower than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people got unhappy in the </v>

335
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.531
<v Speaker 2>relationship degenerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it got above 11 positive </v>

336
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:33.600
<v Speaker 2>interactions to one negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>

337
00:17:33.601 --> 00:17:38.601
<v Speaker 2>it also became unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is that </v>

338
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.790
<v Speaker 2>there is no corrective information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

339
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:51.041
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one for people to grasp </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they often don't get to </v>

340
00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:51.230
<v Speaker 2>contentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it content that exactly?</v>

341
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Or is it spaces or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's also there's something horrific </v>

342
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.030
<v Speaker 2>about only seeing the positive reflected</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to you.</v>

343
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

344
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 4>take things for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>

345
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I always say about blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when I'm writing any project,</v>

346
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 4>if there's not a certain point that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>scared that I can't pull it off.</v>

347
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.040
<v Speaker 5>I haven't chosen the right project.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

348
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

349
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.510
<v Speaker 5>18 novels in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've written 10 scripts,</v>

350
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 5>I've written 80.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

351
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.800
<v Speaker 5>and part of that is how to change things</v>
<v Speaker 5>up and this whole notion that we're </v>

352
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:24.860
<v Speaker 5>talking about with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this character,</v>

353
00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:27.440
<v Speaker 5>with them and smoke started with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

354
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:31.490
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about writing this ultra </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad ass assassin character.</v>

355
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.590
<v Speaker 5>It's a thriller or deals with other </v>
<v Speaker 5>themes,</v>

356
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:36.680
<v Speaker 5>some of which we can get into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But part of what I thought about was,</v>

357
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we never see.</v>

358
00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:43.181
<v Speaker 5>We never see James Bond go home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We never see Jason Bourne and a bad ass </v>

359
00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:48.101
<v Speaker 5>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's bleeding in his arm and he gets in </v>

360
00:18:48.101 --> 00:18:50.831
<v Speaker 5>an elevator with a single mom who is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>elderly woman who's a neighbor in the </v>

361
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.710
<v Speaker 5>nagging him to go to his homeowner's </v>
<v Speaker 5>association meeting because you haven't </v>

362
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.710
<v Speaker 5>done it yet.</v>

363
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.640
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I can create a character who </v>

364
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.561
<v Speaker 5>represent these archetypical ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but crossing in the world with me and </v>

365
00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:03.740
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's done that.</v>

366
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.930
<v Speaker 5>And the whole time I was writing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking,</v>

367
00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:09.890
<v Speaker 5>is this going to just fail miserably?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this not going to interest people and</v>

368
00:19:09.891 --> 00:19:11.840
<v Speaker 5>my birth because we're using,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

369
00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:16.010
<v Speaker 5>anyone who's writing genre,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're using a previous mole,</v>

370
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.040
<v Speaker 5>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean in a way that's </v>

371
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.040
<v Speaker 5>denigrating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

372
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.040
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what Shakespeare,</v>

373
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

374
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.751
<v Speaker 5>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the destructuring containment and </v>

375
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:26.930
<v Speaker 5>traditions of reform form can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>enormously useful.</v>

376
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.660
<v Speaker 5>But I'm always trying to tap it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>break it at the edges.</v>

377
00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I did that a lot when I was writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>Batman.</v>

378
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about the comics and bit.</v>

379
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.430
<v Speaker 2>You wrote Batman for hold on</v>

380
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.390
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two years.</v>

381
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.770
<v Speaker 5>I started writing six months of the pain</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

382
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.720
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I had this really funny thing.</v>

383
00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:46.940
<v Speaker 5>I was writing for marvel or Wolverine </v>
<v Speaker 5>and punish her or her,</v>

384
00:19:46.941 --> 00:19:51.941
<v Speaker 5>two of my favorite characters and dc </v>
<v Speaker 5>came along and told me I could do sort </v>

385
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.720
<v Speaker 5>of whatever I wanted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick a character.</v>

386
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.110
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I really want to do is write a </v>

387
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.291
<v Speaker 5>graphic novel of the pain Goin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he sort of looked at me with alarm </v>

388
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.240
<v Speaker 5>because of all the choices that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was totally bizarre.</v>

389
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.380
<v Speaker 5>But one of my big inspirations and </v>
<v Speaker 5>comics is the killing Joe by Alan more.</v>

390
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:12.380
<v Speaker 5>That's the the essential origin story of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the joker.</v>

391
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:14.450
<v Speaker 5>And I thought the pain one had always </v>
<v Speaker 5>been kind of a joke.</v>

392
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.370
<v Speaker 5>And furthermore I thought how </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting,</v>

393
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:21.371
<v Speaker 5>because if you're the penguin then </v>
<v Speaker 5>Batman is the enemy at that man is a </v>

394
00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:22.310
<v Speaker 5>bully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

395
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 5>And so I wanted to do this alternate </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and so he was like,</v>

396
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Polisher dc let me do it.</v>

397
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Speaker 5>But I still remember there was an online</v>
<v Speaker 5>poll that said that they listed 10 </v>

398
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.810
<v Speaker 5>upcoming comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind among it and asked how much readers</v>

399
00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:37.160
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're anticipating them.</v>

400
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:38.230
<v Speaker 5>And I got point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

401
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.480
<v Speaker 5>three percent of the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I still remember one of my favorite </v>

402
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 5>denigrating comments of all time is one </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy just wrote,</v>

403
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm so glad her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his mom voted for him,</v>

404
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.820
<v Speaker 3>which was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he came out to like the interest </v>

405
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 3>of no one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happened is,</v>

406
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 3>is that the critics really spoke to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then readers really sparked to it </v>

407
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 3>and people all of a sudden said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never looked at the pain when this</v>

408
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:07.261
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was this very interesting object </v>

409
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:07.261
<v Speaker 3>lesson that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had I gone for the obvious and said,</v>

410
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:09.780
<v Speaker 3>let me write Batman right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or let me write superman right away.</v>

411
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 3>I chose something that was super bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had to write.</v>

412
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.240
<v Speaker 3>And then I knew that I really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write and could do well and from the </v>

413
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 3>most unlikely position it led to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>having,</v>

414
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 3>it sort of led to a whole other phase in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my career,</v>

415
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I found myself,</v>

416
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden I'm working on Batman </v>

417
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 3>for two years with the best artists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

418
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:29.550
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

419
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.140
<v Speaker 2>he took a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a lowly approach and an approach</v>

420
00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:35.780
<v Speaker 2>to something that people actually phoned</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemptible</v>

421
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

422
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

423
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.500
<v Speaker 2>and through that you got what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what in the world wasn't about the </v>

424
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.510
<v Speaker 2>penguin and the story that you wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the why in the world.</v>

425
00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Did the Penguin grip you like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any idea,</v>

426
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.360
<v Speaker 2>and tell us again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell us what you made of it as well.</v>

427
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

428
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I had a strong affinity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

429
00:21:54.931 --> 00:21:59.931
<v Speaker 3>for the killing joke and I always </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought the pain one was so interesting </v>

430
00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:03.201
<v Speaker 3>because of all of Batman's rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the only one who's saying that </v>

431
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.640
<v Speaker 3>right of the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.730
<v Speaker 3>of all of the nemeses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that just really </v>

433
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.881
<v Speaker 3>struck me was this whole way to view </v>
<v Speaker 3>Batman through completely different </v>

434
00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:20.121
<v Speaker 3>prism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you can look at the joker </v>

435
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:20.121
<v Speaker 3>who's insane and then you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Batman,</v>

436
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.080
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that means semi insane too,</v>

437
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.870
<v Speaker 3>like there's craziness and it's such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting prism.</v>

438
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:28.250
<v Speaker 3>So with the pain one I wrote about his </v>
<v Speaker 3>upbringing and you know,</v>

439
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:32.010
<v Speaker 3>he's this unappealing overweight kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His brothers were,</v>

440
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletic and robust.</v>

441
00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 3>He was always bullied growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

442
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:40.791
<v Speaker 3>well guess what Batman is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means like this paragon of a </v>

443
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:40.791
<v Speaker 3>physical specimen.</v>

444
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:42.090
<v Speaker 3>So he's always appearing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

445
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.240
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can get people to empathize with </v>

446
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.900
<v Speaker 3>the penguin and view Batman is a villain</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not as a villain necessarily,</v>

447
00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:53.901
<v Speaker 3>but just to really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can really relate to the penguin </v>

448
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 3>and what his position is in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

449
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that would be cool.</v>

450
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>But also a lot of it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Alyssa lot what happens is like,</v>

451
00:23:01.471 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a conscious thought about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

452
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I was literally driving to the meeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the publisher dc and I just was </v>

453
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.230
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the story,</v>

454
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I know how to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how I want to sort of directed on</v>

455
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:16.160
<v Speaker 3>the page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I want to say with that.</v>

456
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.890
<v Speaker 3>And it's only in hindsight I can look </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and untangle it and realize that,</v>

457
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

458
00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:23.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what I was interested in were,</v>

459
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:24.960
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the aspect that it's,</v>

460
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.240
<v Speaker 3>that he's actually saying and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying way.</v>

461
00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:28.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's a way to look at that man </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a new.</v>

462
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

463
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:34.761
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an interesting idea lurking in </v>

464
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:34.761
<v Speaker 2>there as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

465
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:36.720
<v Speaker 2>if you think of Batman as an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an ideal,</v>

466
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.540
<v Speaker 2>now he's kind of a one dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal.</v>

467
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.320
<v Speaker 2>An ideal is also a judge because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you can't attain exactly </v>

468
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that if you look at it,</v>

469
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you acutely aware of your,</v>

470
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.720
<v Speaker 2>of your lack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on the one hand that ideal is </v>

471
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>something that is positive and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>striving for,</v>

472
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand it's necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's got this.</v>

473
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly a bullying element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something similar to that </v>

474
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 2>because you're insufficient in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

475
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>might say as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that the ideal is one </v>

476
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 2>dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're insufficient in its</v>

477
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:22.661
<v Speaker 2>presence is actually a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit unjust or unfair because </v>

478
00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 2>there may be other dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison along which you're,</v>

479
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you're doing fun.</v>

480
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a claim that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to the postmodernist idea.</v>

481
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 2>You know that if you erect a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of values,</v>

482
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.860
<v Speaker 2>then by necessity you exclude people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that hierarchy and that that is in </v>

483
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>some sense it's oppressive and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

484
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Of course they issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't address is that if there's no</v>

485
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:52.151
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nowhere to go and there's </v>

486
00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:54.280
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a point there that if </v>

487
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.461
<v Speaker 2>you're the exemplar of something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make everyone else feel insufficient in </v>

488
00:24:57.461 --> 00:25:01.511
<v Speaker 2>your presence and you could also imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be easy for that to take on a </v>

489
00:25:01.511 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>bullying aspect.</v>

490
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I still focused a lot on the villains </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their perspective,</v>

491
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 4>so I did it with David Finch on Pearl </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harbor Event and for the new 52 and then</v>

492
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:17.150
<v Speaker 4>I did one with the mad hatter with with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Eaton Vance,</v>

493
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 4>skype or some of these amazing artists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that I put</v>

494
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 3>in one of the comics is one of the thugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>who batman comes along and says like,</v>

495
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.610
<v Speaker 3>you don't remember when you do you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that meant says no,</v>

496
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 3>and you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you came flying through the window and </v>

497
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 3>you know the typical Batman scene and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick me with your,</v>

498
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

499
00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:39.090
<v Speaker 3>your boots leaned on my jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what that surgery was.</v>

500
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I'm living with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes down this very detail </v>

501
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 3>because so often it's Batman swings </v>
<v Speaker 3>through window and smashes a bad guy and</v>

502
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:51.780
<v Speaker 3>we all move on and I took these pauses </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes to kind of look at things from</v>

503
00:25:51.781 --> 00:25:55.470
<v Speaker 3>a different angle and it was horrific </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fractured his skull and his,</v>

504
00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his sinus was out and it was this </v>

505
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 3>horrific injury that took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

506
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 3>15 screws and I sort of detail of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing as he throws it back to </v>

507
00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Batman to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

508
00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:12.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of cannon fodder and your </v>

509
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:12.351
<v Speaker 3>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe what I was doing is wrong.</v>

510
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's the level of pain that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflicted on me nonetheless.</v>

511
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 3>And it was this interesting pause and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say the things that.</v>

512
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>There's always a tightrope act when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing a comic book character </v>

513
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.300
<v Speaker 3>because they're sort of in a public </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

514
00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:25.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't own them.</v>

515
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.590
<v Speaker 3>DC doesn't fully own them though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They owned them legally.</v>

516
00:26:28.591 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Speaker 3>But like the stuff that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't do,</v>

517
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.840
<v Speaker 3>you can't have Batman and kill a bus </v>
<v Speaker 3>load of nuns.</v>

518
00:26:33.841 --> 00:26:38.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But part of what they hire me is it's </v>

519
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:39.480
<v Speaker 3>like I need to bring something new to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this character,</v>

520
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 3>but also I need to honor the traditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have come before.</v>

521
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.440
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I've been entrusted with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing where I have to play with it </v>

522
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 3>and I have to navigate that tight rope </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

523
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:55.401
<v Speaker 3>very meticulously to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it worth them bringing me on to </v>

524
00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:59.611
<v Speaker 3>give readers something new and to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself feel like I've put my own stamp </v>

525
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 3>on the character but not stray too far.</v>

526
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's a real exercise in being this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

527
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding the flame of this tradition.</v>

528
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.080
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways I did that a lot too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

529
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 3>that did was I would make fun of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition itself.</v>

530
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I got slightly mete with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance.</v>

531
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.730
<v Speaker 3>So it gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One example is I did a scene where Jim </v>

532
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the police commissioner is talking,</v>

533
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's late at night.</v>

534
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Batman appears in his office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're having a conversation,</v>

535
00:27:24.621 --> 00:27:29.621
<v Speaker 3>it's darkly lit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jim starts to muse on something and </v>

536
00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:29.621
<v Speaker 3>he walks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

537
00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 3>So the frame is just with him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking out the window and he talks for </v>

538
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 3>two panels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he says,</v>

539
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.730
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the part where I turned around </v>

540
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.730
<v Speaker 3>and you're no longer there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

541
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 3>And there's a blank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Batman says,</v>

542
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they turned around and regard </v>

543
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 3>each other very awkwardly for a panel </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they go,</v>

544
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 3>all right then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they will walk away awkwardly.</v>

545
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's knowing that we all live in a world</v>

546
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 3>of Batman comics and maybe Batman </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself even does also.</v>

547
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 3>And some of those little nuances are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a way to kind of massage,</v>

548
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 3>massage it into something in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a culture that's increasingly pop </v>

549
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 3>cultural where.</v>

550
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was thinking about this perfection </v>

551
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.810
<v Speaker 2>issue again and the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>monstrousness.</v>

552
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 2>So I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a billion wicked </v>

553
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.321
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very interesting book of the </v>

554
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Google engineers were looking at google </v>
<v Speaker 2>searches and trying to do psychology as </v>

555
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 2>a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because they're engineers,</v>

556
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll think anything they want to </v>

557
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 2>think and they don't care much about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct it is.</v>

558
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.200
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they noted was </v>

559
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.201
<v Speaker 2>that they were looking at pornography </v>
<v Speaker 2>use and it's no surprise to anyone,</v>

560
00:28:38.021 --> 00:28:42.850
<v Speaker 2>of course the men use images for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pornography fundamentally,</v>

561
00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:45.400
<v Speaker 2>and everyone knows what the images are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

562
00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:45.910
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

563
00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.130
<v Speaker 2>it's usually young women who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>symmetrical and so forth and,</v>

564
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and youthful from associate biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because that's associated </v>

565
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.400
<v Speaker 2>with a fruitfulness and fecundity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

566
00:28:57.401 --> 00:28:57.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

567
00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

568
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.250
<v Speaker 3>that's actually my favorite website is </v>
<v Speaker 3>young women who were symmetrical not </v>

569
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.810
<v Speaker 3>call the advertisement has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different,</v>

570
00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:07.670
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless point is taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

571
00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:08.410
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

572
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>They also looked at female pornography </v>
<v Speaker 2>use and that surprisingly enough,</v>

573
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:19.221
<v Speaker 2>and it was almost all literary it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written and it was stories and they </v>

574
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 2>pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the basic story,</v>

575
00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:27.651
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely useful because in some ways </v>

576
00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:30.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been looking for the </v>

577
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:30.681
<v Speaker 2>fundamental female myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

578
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.960
<v Speaker 2>because it's not exactly the same as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hero archetype,</v>

579
00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:37.000
<v Speaker 2>which is perhaps the fundamental male </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth.</v>

580
00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:42.001
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female myth was essentially beauty </v>

581
00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy was basically obviously,</v>

582
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>and she would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would entice him into a relationship</v>

583
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.660
<v Speaker 2>that would tame him in some sense and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would become humanized but under her </v>

584
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.600
<v Speaker 2>tutelage and devote himself to her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they named the five most common beasts </v>

585
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:08.970
<v Speaker 2>in this kind of literature be soft </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate Augie or maybe even hardcore </v>

586
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.630
<v Speaker 2>pornographic literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that even a Harlequin,</v>

587
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.640
<v Speaker 2>the big purveyor of romance novels has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty hardcore side imprint.</v>

588
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The five most popular beasts were </v>

589
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 2>surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire,</v>

590
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 2>pirate vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're wolf,</v>

591
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.110
<v Speaker 2>really quite comical as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

593
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 2>But it made me think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you were talking about perfection,</v>

594
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that there is a kind of monstrousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperfection as well.</v>

595
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.120
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

597
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research evidence seems to suggest </v>

598
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.661
<v Speaker 2>that women made across and up dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies where men mate across and </v>

599
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 2>down socio economic dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

600
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:59.821
<v Speaker 2>And so the women are in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to guys who are unit </v>

601
00:30:59.821 --> 00:31:03.831
<v Speaker 2>dimensionally monstrous enough to climb </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the top of a given dominance </v>

602
00:31:03.831 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

603
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.420
<v Speaker 2>and so that begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that in that drive for </v>

604
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.401
<v Speaker 2>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there isn't something intrinsically </v>

605
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:16.981
<v Speaker 2>monstrous and that has something to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the willingness to sacrifice </v>

606
00:31:16.981 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 2>everything else to that single minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit.</v>

607
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.810
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder if those things are even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can even take them apart because </v>

608
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Batman who's obviously a creature of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

609
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say he's probably the superhero </v>

610
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 2>that has the most self evident </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of pathology associated with</v>

611
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:40.951
<v Speaker 2>his character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that because he's this </v>

612
00:31:40.951 --> 00:31:43.111
<v Speaker 2>dark guy and he definitely operates </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the parameters of the law </v>

613
00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:47.491
<v Speaker 2>quite clearly and is motivated to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>small and by vengeance I would say like </v>

614
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.970
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the borderline between vengeance and </v>

615
00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.871
<v Speaker 2>justice is of course very murky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you talked about the,</v>

616
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the requirement or the utility of </v>

617
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 2>intimacy in buffering against that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>

618
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.911
<v Speaker 2>But that makes you wonder too if it also</v>
<v Speaker 2>provides a necessary buffer against </v>

619
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:11.911
<v Speaker 2>monster business.</v>

620
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Well that's to the hard part than </v>
<v Speaker 4>turning into a killer and the hard part </v>

621
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 4>of keeping you human</v>

622
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.040
<v Speaker 5>and that that's the law that he deals </v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

623
00:32:25.041 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 5>But I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

624
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.580
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with orphan x,</v>

625
00:32:28.581 --> 00:32:30.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a book that connected </v>
<v Speaker 5>with readers.</v>

626
00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:33.290
<v Speaker 5>It's been translated and published in 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>languages.</v>

627
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 5>The vast majority of emails that I get </v>
<v Speaker 5>or about his relationship trying to </v>

628
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 5>navigate way through the normal world.</v>

629
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.830
<v Speaker 3>That's the stuff that people love with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

630
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 3>So there's the mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the spy stuff.</v>

631
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd say there's two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is that he is a trained </v>

632
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 3>assassin who now is become a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bono was asset.</v>

633
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 3>His moral compass was never broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of his upbringing with Jack.</v>

634
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:02.290
<v Speaker 3>He now helps only the truly desperate </v>
<v Speaker 3>orals to turn evil capitalist.</v>

635
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he has.</v>

636
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 3>He has money stash and bank accounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere for when he was operating off</v>

637
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:11.070
<v Speaker 3>the books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>

638
00:33:11.071 --> 00:33:16.071
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a good capitalist string still </v>

639
00:33:16.071 --> 00:33:18.491
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing is these </v>

640
00:33:18.491 --> 00:33:18.491
<v Speaker 3>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

641
00:33:18.491 --> 00:33:22.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a single mother who's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>widowed with a young boy who lives </v>

642
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>downstairs from him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he is,</v>

643
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.590
<v Speaker 3>who he is in amherst have but has no </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

644
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't speak the language of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimacy.</v>

645
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.120
<v Speaker 3>So there's this like distant flirtatious</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with her.</v>

646
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.160
<v Speaker 3>The boys very enamored of Evan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't quite know what to do with </v>

647
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.490
<v Speaker 3>her to complicate matters further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a district attorney,</v>

648
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 3>so she actually knew anything about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's legitimate and she'd have to </v>

649
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.341
<v Speaker 3>prosecute him and those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those moments of him trying to figure </v>

650
00:33:45.341 --> 00:33:45.560
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

651
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm carrying out this mission that </v>
<v Speaker 3>requires comprehensive discipline and </v>

652
00:33:50.871 --> 00:33:55.871
<v Speaker 3>focus and yet here's this draw to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman and her kid and they'll kind of </v>

653
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.180
<v Speaker 3>warmth of a house that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an immense draw for him and I </v>

654
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.511
<v Speaker 3>think at the heart of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this conflict where like I </v>

655
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:04.511
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I view it.</v>

656
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Then he's kind of got his face up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>glass and he's looking at it.</v>

657
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 3>All of these people leading ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives that he himself could never leave.</v>

658
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Like he can never live those lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so what he can do is to protect </v>

659
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.241
<v Speaker 3>people when those ordinary lives are </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupted and when they're put upon by </v>

660
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 3>horrible men.</v>

661
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are horrible.</v>

662
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Unfixable solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cops can't help you.</v>

663
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can help you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerless.</v>

664
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 3>You've been bullied nearly into oblivion</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a huge risk to yourself.</v>

665
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.400
<v Speaker 3>They can call him and he can fix it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can constantly reestablished and </v>

666
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.941
<v Speaker 3>protect the lives of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't ever have that and so that </v>

667
00:34:39.941 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 3>for me is what's really interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes a twist in the knower man,</v>

668
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:47.651
<v Speaker 3>as we discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which deals more with kind of different </v>

669
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:49.680
<v Speaker 3>thematics since he's the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>captured about aging versus you know,</v>

670
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.160
<v Speaker 3>about trying to be everything versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be one thing.</v>

671
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You played that out differently in the </v>

672
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 3>nowhere man was different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

673
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a slightly different theme,</v>

674
00:34:58.611 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

675
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a peter pan theme there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

676
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

677
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:05.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

678
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

679
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the nowhere,</v>

680
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for the second book,</v>

681
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 3>it's always tricky to follow up a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

682
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

683
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 3>that connects with the readership in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way,</v>

684
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 3>but I really wanted to turn reader </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectations on their head.</v>

685
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.940
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

686
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:24.941
<v Speaker 3>what if instead of of avid going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing another mission that we're used </v>

687
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:30.191
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets the anonymous phone call and </v>

688
00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:31.861
<v Speaker 3>goes and help someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if he finds himself in exactly the </v>

689
00:35:31.861 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 3>kind of predicament that other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually call him before,</v>

690
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.740
<v Speaker 3>so the no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda opens with him and finishing out </v>

691
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 3>the end of an operation somehow manages </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get kidnapped,</v>

692
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:44.091
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes to in this distant chateau </v>

693
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:47.601
<v Speaker 3>where he's being overseen by a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Renee Peter casserole and we're </v>

694
00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 3>not quite sure why he's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who he is.</v>

695
00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are going to get really bad.</v>

696
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:57.141
<v Speaker 3>There's dozens of armed guards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ever now is the one who he would </v>

697
00:35:57.141 --> 00:36:01.161
<v Speaker 3>normally call and has to free himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's about his own liberation to get </v>

698
00:36:01.161 --> 00:36:05.421
<v Speaker 3>back to finishing the mission that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to do and to protect other people </v>

699
00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:05.421
<v Speaker 3>were at the chateau.</v>

700
00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 3>But what was interesting to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation that we seem to always have</v>

701
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.090
<v Speaker 3>in in thrillers and mysteries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

702
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.900
<v Speaker 3>You're just like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

703
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Renee has a similar thing to have and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>says like me,</v>

704
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:21.680
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows he's a vigilante,</v>

705
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 3>doesn't quite know what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he thinks he's might be a drug </v>

706
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 3>dealer or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an arms dealer.</v>

707
00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's ambiguous,</v>

708
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:32.871
<v Speaker 3>he's really just after a particular bank</v>
<v Speaker 3>account that evidence attached to it </v>

709
00:36:32.871 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 3>hasn't yet learned to realize and Evelyn</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

710
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be everything.</v>

711
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

712
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 3>and it occurred to me when I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

713
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 3>So Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Renee,</v>

714
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Renee.</v>

715
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:48.021
<v Speaker 3>Peter Cassar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roy casserole is a play on the French </v>

716
00:36:48.021 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 3>word for Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's sort of read a Peter Pan.</v>

717
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:49.680
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

718
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 3>he's obsessed with luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with being all things with,</v>

719
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 3>with not making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with turning back the clock on aging.</v>

720
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 3>He takes a regimen of pills he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with,</v>

721
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.600
<v Speaker 3>with the aging process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it occurred to me again after I </v>

722
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.841
<v Speaker 3>wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't go in charting these </v>

723
00:37:08.841 --> 00:37:10.581
<v Speaker 3>things out like an engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go in writing a story that I want to </v>

724
00:37:10.581 --> 00:37:14.451
<v Speaker 3>write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it occurred to me that Evan </v>

725
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:14.451
<v Speaker 3>statement to say were as different as </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be.</v>

726
00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 3>You want to be everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be one thing.</v>

727
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:20.691
<v Speaker 3>Well that being one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well is our only antidote really to </v>

728
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 3>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the exact opposite of what renee</v>

729
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 3>is trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's</v>

730
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the antidote to remaining that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's the antidote to to becoming an</v>

731
00:37:31.611 --> 00:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>old child to which is of course it </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends story,</v>

732
00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:40.421
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this idea that you have to give </v>

733
00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:42.170
<v Speaker 2>up everything to become one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

734
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't give it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you become no thing eventually </v>

735
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 2>because aging drives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's also why your character </v>

736
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 2>casserole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

737
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Has to find off aging because aging is </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing him to become well at,</v>

738
00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 2>if not to become one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least to lose his capacity to become </v>

739
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:01.730
<v Speaker 2>anything or everything.</v>

740
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the only thing that,</v>

741
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:10.210
<v Speaker 3>that that's your board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the other argument to </v>

742
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:10.210
<v Speaker 3>perfection versus intimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some person,</v>

743
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.920
<v Speaker 3>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the toll of aging takes perfection away </v>

744
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.150
<v Speaker 3>from us in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a sharp shooter,</v>

745
00:38:17.151 --> 00:38:22.151
<v Speaker 3>if you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're young Paul Newman and look </v>

746
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:25.401
<v Speaker 3>like young Paul Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is probably the best working human </v>

747
00:38:25.401 --> 00:38:26.300
<v Speaker 3>humanum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either gender in history at some point,</v>

748
00:38:26.301 --> 00:38:28.160
<v Speaker 3>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a perfect app,</v>

749
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.400
<v Speaker 3>you're a great surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfection will be taken from you.</v>

750
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.310
<v Speaker 3>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the antidote to that?</v>

751
00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 3>They ended up to that doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something else.</v>

752
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Well at making choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you a good husband?</v>

753
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Are you a good father?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a good.</v>

754
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that community around you and your </v>

755
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>friendships around you so that when an </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent comes and starts to kick out those</v>

756
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.921
<v Speaker 3>stilts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have enough under you that you're </v>

757
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:52.921
<v Speaker 3>just topple over.</v>

758
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:52.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

759
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's interesting because the.</v>

760
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.110
<v Speaker 2>You talked about the necessity for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>

761
00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:02.850
<v Speaker 2>for perfection as an antidote say to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Pan Problem,</v>

762
00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:07.851
<v Speaker 2>but what the case you're making now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of that even perfection as an </v>

763
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:13.770
<v Speaker 2>antidote to the Peter Pan Syndrome has </v>
<v Speaker 2>its problems,</v>

764
00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:18.771
<v Speaker 2>but maybe those aren't echoed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimacy and you know,</v>

765
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:23.870
<v Speaker 2>because you talked about getting older </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that your family and </v>

766
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.291
<v Speaker 2>friends become more important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely something that I've </v>

767
00:39:27.291 --> 00:39:27.291
<v Speaker 2>noticed.</v>

768
00:39:27.291 --> 00:39:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

769
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess on your death bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

770
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

771
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.270
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's going to matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>is who's around there with you?</v>

772
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

773
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.480
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you get older and you get robbed </v>

774
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.241
<v Speaker 2>if things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's the intimate </v>

775
00:39:47.241 --> 00:39:50.211
<v Speaker 2>relationships that you have to provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>solace with regards to that.</v>

776
00:39:50.431 --> 00:39:55.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that distresses me </v>

777
00:39:55.431 --> 00:39:56.940
<v Speaker 2>about the way that our world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the modern Western world is unfolding is</v>

778
00:39:56.941 --> 00:40:01.941
<v Speaker 2>that we act as if we're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be any older than 35 young talked about.</v>

779
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Carl Jung talked about that he thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a flaw in our founding myth </v>

780
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.140
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is predicated on Christianity.</v>

781
00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Of course Christ died when he was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>32.</v>

782
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory and so there's not </v>

783
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.420
<v Speaker 2>necessarily any model there for moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the latter house of life and there </v>

784
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:26.001
<v Speaker 2>is this obsession in western culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>with youthfulness and with the </v>

785
00:40:26.001 --> 00:40:29.520
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of youth and people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People Act,</v>

786
00:40:29.521 --> 00:40:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I would say is if they're never going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get old,</v>

787
00:40:31.771 --> 00:40:36.771
<v Speaker 2>and so they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the dangers there is that you </v>

788
00:40:36.771 --> 00:40:38.820
<v Speaker 2>don't establish the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships that are going to buttress</v>

789
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you in your old age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ended up finding a sample in your </v>

790
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.150
<v Speaker 2>forties or whatever and it starts to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty ugly.</v>

791
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:45.930
<v Speaker 2>It loans</v>

792
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 4>in La because La is the land of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perpetual adolescence,</v>

793
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone comes out here off their </v>

794
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.741
<v Speaker 3>proverbial bus from Des Moines or </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern Alberta and they want to make </v>

795
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:05.401
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the best looking person from </v>

796
00:41:05.401 --> 00:41:06.370
<v Speaker 3>their hometown and who started their </v>
<v Speaker 3>hometown play and you know,</v>

797
00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 3>it's squeezing the universe through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>funnel for people.</v>

798
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:12.130
<v Speaker 3>We're actually going to be a movie star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going to make it as a singer,</v>

799
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's sorta this intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcement thing that happens is it's</v>

800
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:21.031
<v Speaker 3>like they'll go two or three years </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on jobs because they need to </v>

801
00:41:21.031 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>keep their schedule open for auditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll get cast as an extra in</v>

802
00:41:23.591 --> 00:41:26.860
<v Speaker 3>one thing and then they go three or four</v>
<v Speaker 3>more years because,</v>

803
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:31.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because at any point you could hit the </v>

804
00:41:31.861 --> 00:41:31.861
<v Speaker 3>lottery and everyone has the story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

805
00:41:31.861 --> 00:41:32.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was a,</v>

806
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know our,</v>

807
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 3>our culture is also built around never </v>
<v Speaker 3>give up,</v>

808
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

809
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow your dreams.</v>

810
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

811
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a pervasive notion that you </v>

812
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 3>never settle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

813
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not denigrating those things.</v>

814
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that that's part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture is built,</v>

815
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 3>but you see a ton of people here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their forties,</v>

816
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:58.571
<v Speaker 3>fifties who never sort of moved onto a </v>
<v Speaker 3>job or a scaled.</v>

817
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:04.541
<v Speaker 3>It's gratifying there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their whole life has been spent waiting </v>

818
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 3>for another break and it's heartbreaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

819
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:07.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had where they had some success for</v>

820
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 3>a period of never recaptured it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't reinvent themselves.</v>

821
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.400
<v Speaker 3>I noticed something really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went to Australia for book tour </v>

822
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:15.400
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going back there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

823
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 3>and a couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was amazing,</v>

824
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.811
<v Speaker 3>which is I did a lot of events with </v>
<v Speaker 3>really famous Australians who didn't </v>

825
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:27.881
<v Speaker 3>cross over to the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you have your ACDC that came </v>

826
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:27.881
<v Speaker 3>over here and just blew out bird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Nicole mean fill in the blank.</v>

828
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 3>But there was people who were like big </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie stars who didn't make it here.</v>

829
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:38.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an enormous rock band there that </v>

830
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.810
<v Speaker 3>just didn't make it to the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the one thing that I was amazed with</v>

831
00:42:41.811 --> 00:42:46.811
<v Speaker 3>is for some reason I came into contact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them either for festivals or you </v>

832
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.831
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we we had reading together is they all </v>

833
00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:53.141
<v Speaker 3>had meaningful second slash third acts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy who was a big huge movie </v>

834
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Speaker 3>star there was now a big crime fiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviewer,</v>

835
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.660
<v Speaker 3>so I met him because you just don't make</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of money and fame here and have</v>

836
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 3>the kind of blown out at exposure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you linger in and capture catch.</v>

837
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:14.831
<v Speaker 3>After the guy who was a songwriter for </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest rock bands in all of </v>

838
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 3>us wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote this amazing memoir,</v>

839
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 3>was like incredible and was working on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

840
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.100
<v Speaker 3>And it's sorta like if you don't achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sort of astronomical level of </v>

841
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 3>exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fame and money,</v>

842
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.400
<v Speaker 3>you still have to make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And making a living is a really good </v>

843
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 3>motivation to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to continue to search for and find </v>

844
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

845
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

846
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

847
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the problems with having </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth I think with regards to children </v>

848
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're wealthy you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>children can be deprived of necessity.</v>

849
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they and also usually by the time </v>

850
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 3>one his attained wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've sort of baked in the discipline </v>

851
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 3>of your end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the love for your field that led to us.</v>

852
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess we can exclude people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that do a job that they hate forever,</v>

853
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but usually people who really make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of money sort of love what they're doing</v>

854
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:09.821
<v Speaker 3>at some level I find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the time you get to a point,</v>

855
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:14.861
<v Speaker 3>do you know what her after work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you love the work so much and you start </v>

856
00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:17.681
<v Speaker 3>to realize that the money once people </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped chasing you for bills is what </v>

857
00:44:17.681 --> 00:44:22.570
<v Speaker 3>brings you the happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you couldn't take all the </v>

858
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 3>shortcuts when you were younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like trust fund kids can.</v>

859
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

860
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.850
<v Speaker 2>the empirical evidence on that is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>

861
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Just give me one sec here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a relationship between material</v>

862
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking or let's say wealth and</v>

863
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:50.361
<v Speaker 2>happiness up to the point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in the lower middle class I </v>

864
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:56.181
<v Speaker 2>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically the point where </v>

865
00:44:56.181 --> 00:44:56.181
<v Speaker 2>bill collectors stopped chasing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

866
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.700
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely pain in privation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't a tremendous amount of </v>

867
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 2>advantage by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

868
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:08.180
<v Speaker 2>by the evidence in moving far up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic ladder beyond that,</v>

869
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:12.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's because money solves a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain set of,</v>

870
00:45:12.861 --> 00:45:17.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ones that doesn't solve it </v>

871
00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:19.861
<v Speaker 2>doesn't solve it all right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't solve love that it doesn't </v>

872
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:23.731
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ensuring that your children are doing </v>

873
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:23.731
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't solve health.</v>

874
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any final sense that the problem with</v>

875
00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:31.381
<v Speaker 2>the oral health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also thinking with regards to </v>

876
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:35.551
<v Speaker 2>perfection and intimacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another kind of opposition </v>

877
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:39.931
<v Speaker 2>between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that if you're after </v>

878
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:42.190
<v Speaker 2>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have intimacy because you have</v>

879
00:45:42.191 --> 00:45:47.191
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned that we have this idea </v>

880
00:45:47.191 --> 00:45:49.891
<v Speaker 2>that you shouldn't settle and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>often say that in relationship to their </v>

881
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:54.661
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they forget that the person that </v>

882
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you're having a relationship with has </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled for you.</v>

883
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

884
00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:01.870
<v Speaker 2>that means that they've settled for </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperfection in every sense of the word.</v>

885
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.370
<v Speaker 6>And you,</v>

886
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.710
<v Speaker 2>if you're after perfection in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

887
00:46:08.711 --> 00:46:11.620
<v Speaker 2>then first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have impossible standards.</v>

888
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Second year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to live with.</v>

889
00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you meet someone that triggers that </v>

890
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.050
<v Speaker 2>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to feel so inferior in</v>

891
00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:22.630
<v Speaker 2>relationship to them that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a fool of yourself.</v>

892
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the classical animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomness possession from the union </v>

893
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.011
<v Speaker 2>you find someone who meets your ideal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection and then you're so tongue </v>

895
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:35.281
<v Speaker 2>tied in their presence that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>help but act like a complete deer in the</v>

896
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:38.020
<v Speaker 2>headlights or something equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological.</v>

897
00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.680
<v Speaker 2>So to get into the scene you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give up that you have to give up that </v>

898
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.370
<v Speaker 2>demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for immediate perfection May.</v>

899
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could work towards it within </v>
<v Speaker 2>the confines of the relationship.</v>

900
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>But that's a whole different thing.</v>

901
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.870
<v Speaker 4>Well driller perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for me,</v>

902
00:46:53.871 --> 00:46:57.770
<v Speaker 4>what was so interesting in building that</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Evan is</v>

903
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's trained as a lone wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

904
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.470
<v Speaker 3>There's an orphan program that kicked </v>
<v Speaker 3>out orphans,</v>

905
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:05.350
<v Speaker 3>but none of them know who each other is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They operate alone,</v>

906
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.940
<v Speaker 3>but he's chosen to live in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this residential tower in the world </v>

907
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 3>corridor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of hiding among people.</v>

908
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 3>But so he's constantly among people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he sticks to his normal routine,</v>

909
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 3>which is just training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got like a hidden vault that's like</v>

910
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:23.481
<v Speaker 3>as operations comm center that's hidden </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back of his super modern </v>

911
00:47:23.481 --> 00:47:28.050
<v Speaker 3>penthouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these sort of fantasy </v>

912
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.561
<v Speaker 3>elements to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think I undercut enough to not </v>

913
00:47:30.561 --> 00:47:31.040
<v Speaker 3>turn it into like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 3>weapons foreign or spy car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

915
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

916
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 3>there's an awareness that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

917
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I roamed it,</v>

918
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:42.601
<v Speaker 3>Debbie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even as I revel in some of these </v>

919
00:47:42.601 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 3>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he just sticks to his routine,</v>

920
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>there is no one there to tell him or </v>
<v Speaker 3>point out his imperfections.</v>

921
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he's on a mission,</v>

922
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.020
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's operating Solo.</v>

923
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 3>He's kicking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has the righteousness and the moral,</v>

924
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:58.410
<v Speaker 3>the legitimate moral superiority of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing what is the right thing in the </v>

925
00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 3>protection of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all fine.</v>

926
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.360
<v Speaker 3>There's no one to literally gaze on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hammer.</v>

927
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Even look at him and notice where his </v>
<v Speaker 3>imperfections are.</v>

928
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:11.551
<v Speaker 3>Notice where his tongue tied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Notice what skills that there are that </v>

929
00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 3>he's lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If his life stays in that narrow lane,</v>

930
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't want his life to just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that lane,</v>

931
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:19.651
<v Speaker 3>but every time he widens it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these complications where </v>

932
00:48:19.651 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with an unruly eight year</v>

933
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 3>old who's asking you inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions?</v>

934
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 3>These are things that his training </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't for.</v>

935
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:30.480
<v Speaker 3>And there's a real interest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the other things I wanted to </v>

936
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.600
<v Speaker 3>add as you talked about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the female or erotica or the or the that</v>

937
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:39.030
<v Speaker 3>women tend to read and the types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters which I love that the surgeon </v>

938
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.030
<v Speaker 3>is included.</v>

939
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:40.430
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

940
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of them can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can start combining them.</v>

941
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 3>So you get like a werewolf surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can really start upping the ante.</v>

942
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.210
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting in terms of what </v>

943
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.091
<v Speaker 3>constitutes a successful balance to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not also the full teaming of the </v>

944
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:59.521
<v Speaker 3>monstrous of perfectionism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether like in this instance we're </v>

945
00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:01.840
<v Speaker 3>talking about that being from the male </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of it.</v>

946
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:07.470
<v Speaker 3>It's also like I had a question that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did an interview yesterday and </v>

947
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 3>somebody asked me who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows me and my wife pretty well,</v>

948
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 3>and so does your wife get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does she get upset when you're like,</v>

949
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:18.091
<v Speaker 3>okay honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm off to like the Mexican jungles to </v>

950
00:49:18.091 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 3>go down class for a Whitewater rafts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the researcher.</v>

951
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

952
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:25.290
<v Speaker 3>like I just was on a range in vegas </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting a lot of insane weapon where </v>

953
00:49:25.301 --> 00:49:26.490
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

954
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:26.980
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm,</v>

955
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.040
<v Speaker 3>when I'm doing these sort of more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous elements that are for </v>

956
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.040
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>

957
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.170
<v Speaker 3>And it was interesting because I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been asked that that specifically,</v>

958
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.200
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I would as a writer when I met my </v>

959
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.800
<v Speaker 3>wife and she liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new that and one of the primary themes</v>

960
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 3>is if that's something that you liked in</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

961
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the last thing.</v>

962
00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:50.341
<v Speaker 3>She wants to erode it me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also have a relationship where </v>

963
00:49:50.341 --> 00:49:53.851
<v Speaker 3>like obviously there's things like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are things about me that are </v>

964
00:49:53.851 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 3>annoying to my perfectionism or need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be reined in,</v>

965
00:49:55.270 --> 00:50:00.270
<v Speaker 3>that's a good discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also doesn't mean that you want </v>

966
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:03.091
<v Speaker 3>to hollow out the aspect of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the perfectionist drive or the </v>

967
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 3>aspects that involve sort of dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>with danger,</v>

968
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:13.231
<v Speaker 3>having one foot and monstrosity from </v>
<v Speaker 3>your spouse or partner in either </v>

969
00:50:13.231 --> 00:50:13.231
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

970
00:50:13.231 --> 00:50:18.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I just genuinely like each </v>

971
00:50:18.121 --> 00:50:18.121
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to erode in each other.</v>

972
00:50:18.121 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Those things that caused the initial </v>
<v Speaker 3>attraction.</v>

973
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

974
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that's something you see a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>in marriages.</v>

975
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's particularly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America where you get the sort of </v>

976
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.251
<v Speaker 3>domineering controlling wife and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>husband is like the little boy getting </v>

977
00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:37.151
<v Speaker 3>away with things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get things done and there's </v>

978
00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:40.511
<v Speaker 3>this imbalance that happens really </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly as they push each other into </v>

979
00:50:40.511 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 3>these roles and forget the very things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that more attractive to begin with.</v>

980
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you see that,</v>

981
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 2>you see that operating in the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

982
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Although I would say in a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can see husbands who punish </v>

983
00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 2>or failed to reward their wives for </v>
<v Speaker 2>being attractive.</v>

984
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Even though,</v>

985
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domineering husband.</v>

986
00:50:55.791 --> 00:51:00.791
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said something once that stuck with </v>

987
00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.681
<v Speaker 3>me when I think someone was bragging </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how they never cleaned the house </v>

988
00:51:02.681 --> 00:51:04.080
<v Speaker 3>or something or some such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>

989
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you turn your wife into a maid,</v>

990
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.580
<v Speaker 3>then you'll be married to a maid.</v>

991
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

992
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it was toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

993
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the sort of guy who cleans the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toilets.</v>

994
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:12.560
<v Speaker 2>I think I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

995
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you're the sort of guy who makes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife cleaned the toilets,</v>

996
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

997
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing is that it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult within a relationship to </v>

998
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.720
<v Speaker 2>continually reward your partner for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traits that make them attractive because</v>

999
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 2>that also makes them attractive to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and so if you're concerned in any</v>

1000
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 2>way about your fading attractiveness or </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're jealous or resentful,</v>

1001
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:40.630
<v Speaker 2>then you may come to punish your partner</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what makes them attractive and of </v>

1002
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:45.491
<v Speaker 2>course that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's daft because you'll also have </v>

1003
00:51:45.491 --> 00:51:47.420
<v Speaker 2>contempt for them and for you if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get away with that,</v>

1004
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 2>but it happens a lot.</v>

1005
00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1006
00:51:51.161 --> 00:51:52.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes down to the.</v>

1007
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.690
<v Speaker 3>We've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had this conversation before that </v>

1008
00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:57.690
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are any,</v>

1009
00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.040
<v Speaker 3>there are no decisions that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally moral.</v>

1010
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.560
<v Speaker 3>There's no good decisions when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at something of like,</v>

1011
00:52:02.561 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 90 percent moral,</v>

1012
00:52:05.861 --> 00:52:08.950
<v Speaker 3>but 10 percent shady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can reap huge financial reward.</v>

1013
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think you'll get away with it.</v>

1014
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.010
<v Speaker 3>And likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:52:12.011 --> 00:52:13.930
<v Speaker 3>within a marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1016
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:18.931
<v Speaker 3>if you have a spouse who you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>denigrating or you're concerned about </v>

1017
00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:22.951
<v Speaker 3>their attractiveness because of your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>insecurity and you haven't put that to </v>

1018
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:24.190
<v Speaker 3>rest and you're unwilling to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1019
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.000
<v Speaker 3>that will cost you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1020
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I think about it a lot as pertains to </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing because I think a lot that the </v>

1021
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.941
<v Speaker 3>qualities for me at least that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make me a better writer or the same ones</v>

1022
00:52:37.301 --> 00:52:39.490
<v Speaker 3>that make me a better man and a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

1023
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's not something that people talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot about,</v>

1024
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:43.920
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1025
00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:45.700
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm in a conversation,</v>

1026
00:52:45.701 --> 00:52:50.701
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I acknowledge what my shortcomings </v>

1027
00:52:50.701 --> 00:52:51.040
<v Speaker 3>are and what my flaws are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I acknowledge and an argument what's</v>

1028
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:56.041
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I pay attention to people enough to </v>

1029
00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:58.741
<v Speaker 3>recognize small moments of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerabilities and to try to honor or </v>

1030
00:52:58.751 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 3>respect those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all the things in writing that</v>

1031
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.260
<v Speaker 3>it make people connect to character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all the things in writing that</v>

1032
00:53:05.261 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you need to round out a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember when I was like,</v>

1033
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I started really young and had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>luck early.</v>

1034
00:53:10.541 --> 00:53:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I started my first book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 19.</v>

1035
00:53:12.281 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I sold it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 22,</v>

1036
00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:17.080
<v Speaker 3>23 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's stuff in there that's awful,</v>

1037
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.900
<v Speaker 3>like no one should ever be accountable </v>
<v Speaker 3>for anything that they thought when they</v>

1038
00:53:19.901 --> 00:53:20.560
<v Speaker 3>were 19.</v>

1039
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a line in there where it's like </v>

1040
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>he was the best of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1041
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.380
<v Speaker 3>about like an agent and it's like those </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the people we don't like.</v>

1042
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 3>You just feel like as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of.</v>

1043
00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:35.230
<v Speaker 3>I put the characters are the times where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say something out of a,</v>

1044
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 3>a more base instinct and then you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like shit about it.</v>

1045
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Like that's something that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>relate to a character.</v>

1046
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Like I did this thing and I said </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1047
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I reacted in anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a petty jealousy,</v>

1048
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.400
<v Speaker 3>but that I'm aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I acted badly and I feel I feel badly </v>

1049
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:52.800
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could've acted better.</v>

1050
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.130
<v Speaker 3>But do you need to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1051
00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1052
00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.830
<v Speaker 3>pretty you need to iris pretty wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening to,</v>

1053
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 3>to take that input in if you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented artists</v>

1054
00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 2>because you're trying to capture all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things which means you have to </v>

1055
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 2>look at them in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just another people.</v>

1056
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's something you see in good </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

1057
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 2>And I was watching Louis C K recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he definitely goes too far quite </v>

1058
00:54:17.651 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things about Louis C,</v>

1059
00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:25.671
<v Speaker 2>k that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you also see this as Sarah </v>

1060
00:54:25.671 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're either of them know </v>

1061
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 2>something will come into their hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say it and they know perfectly </v>

1062
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.560
<v Speaker 2>well that they've gone too far but </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to not say it.</v>

1063
00:54:35.561 --> 00:54:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And then they have the good graces to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like self disgusted.</v>

1064
00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I would say that they actually said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.160
<v Speaker 2>and Louis said it's a mix of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust and enterprise.</v>

1066
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1067
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:54.190
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I need Louis Ck has the good graces </v>

1068
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.121
<v Speaker 2>to be embarrassed at least 20 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time for me and for good reason to </v>

1069
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:00.980
<v Speaker 2>like the cinema in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

1071
00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that it's a big part of it is</v>

1072
00:55:04.691 --> 00:55:07.420
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to shut down self </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>

1073
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 2>everything shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1074
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:14.450
<v Speaker 3>And we're talking about with aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about with marriage and </v>

1075
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.821
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also talking about if you </v>

1076
00:55:16.821 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually want to engage in an </v>

1077
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.421
<v Speaker 3>endeavor that is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether that's writing or teaching or </v>

1078
00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:24.891
<v Speaker 3>being a psychologist or being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fill in the blank for anything </v>

1079
00:55:24.891 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 3>that you want to engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that's new and unique.</v>

1080
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 3>You better reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better think on yourself.</v>

1081
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 3>You better not armor yourself solely an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>

1082
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better be able to maintain it.</v>

1083
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 3>It sort of openness to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even as you're learning,</v>

1084
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.690
<v Speaker 3>you better not get too arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go down that checklist,</v>

1085
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I find a lot of them really apply to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing and ways that,</v>

1086
00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:51.860
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are more direct than I ever would </v>

1087
00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.091
<v Speaker 3>have thought would be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start kind of thinking about </v>

1088
00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:56.361
<v Speaker 3>this till I was in my thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also rather on the time that I </v>

1089
00:55:56.361 --> 00:55:58.050
<v Speaker 3>started becoming a better human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1090
00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1091
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:04.191
<v Speaker 3>to really think about like getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught short at times or engaging in </v>

1092
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:06.930
<v Speaker 3>something where I'm so adamant that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>right about it.</v>

1093
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 3>And then reflecting on it afterwards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that I'm wrong.</v>

1094
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:12.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's like there's so much fodder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the gold is in writing.</v>

1095
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:18.410
<v Speaker 3>That's where all those pieces are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really paying attention to people and </v>

1096
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 3>not overlooking their own quiet everyday</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedies and recognizing their everyday</v>

1097
00:56:24.101 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 3>triumphs because that's what rounds out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of character.</v>

1098
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:31.981
<v Speaker 3>If you can capture that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you feel like you're </v>

1099
00:56:31.981 --> 00:56:31.981
<v Speaker 3>reading something that's alive and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1100
00:56:31.981 --> 00:56:34.150
<v Speaker 3>you're reading something that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like is fill in the blanks.</v>

1101
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially with with a forum like,</v>

1102
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 3>like a thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crime Fiction,</v>

1103
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 3>which I'm far from denigrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an incredible forum.</v>

1104
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that's interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that you,</v>

1105
00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a form that you've stuck with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways throughout your writing </v>

1106
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.330
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's been about 20,</v>

1107
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.550
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have 23 books now.</v>

1108
00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.610
<v Speaker 3>I have a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 or 18 out maybe.</v>

1109
00:57:01.611 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 3>And three more than the pyre lot.</v>

1110
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've been basically putting out </v>

1111
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:08.880
<v Speaker 2>something like a book a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.400
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two places we could go with </v>

1113
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.991
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that I'd like to talk with you a </v>

1114
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 2>little bit about how you've actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to have a successful career as a</v>

1115
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 2>writer because that's a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to pull off.</v>

1116
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:25.110
<v Speaker 2>And the other issue is why you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've inserted yourself in this very </v>

1117
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:31.171
<v Speaker 2>limited form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Reform and I'm curious about why </v>

1118
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:36.871
<v Speaker 2>that one and also what it is about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genre and the fact that it's a very,</v>

1119
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 2>very commercial and very attractive in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1120
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say easy way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a very accessible way.</v>

1121
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very accessible to people.</v>

1122
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 2>And so what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the attraction,</v>

1123
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's arguably more </v>

1124
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>literary.</v>

1125
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first thing is,</v>

1126
00:57:56.021 --> 00:58:01.021
<v Speaker 3>is it's like it's not selected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can only write stuff that I feel </v>

1127
00:58:01.251 --> 00:58:06.251
<v Speaker 3>in my gut that I need to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fortunately for me from a financial </v>

1128
00:58:06.501 --> 00:58:10.640
<v Speaker 3>perspective that tends to be stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's highly commercial.</v>

1129
00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.290
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I think about,</v>

1130
00:58:12.291 --> 00:58:12.810
<v Speaker 3>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1131
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:14.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gold standard is always hitchcock.</v>

1132
00:58:14.931 --> 00:58:19.931
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh see commercial or was he a critical </v>

1133
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:21.440
<v Speaker 3>six ass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting is,</v>

1134
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked,</v>

1135
00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.050
<v Speaker 3>we talked about all this stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>only see in hindsight,</v>

1136
00:58:24.051 --> 00:58:29.051
<v Speaker 3>like you follow only the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>of interest and then in hindsight they </v>

1137
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:29.051
<v Speaker 3>all make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1138
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:33.911
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in college I studied English and </v>

1139
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:35.741
<v Speaker 3>psychology as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there and I got really </v>

1140
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:37.880
<v Speaker 3>fascinated with shakespearian tragedy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular and it's like,</v>

1141
00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm studying young Ian,</v>

1142
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:41.180
<v Speaker 3>analysis of Shakespearian tragedy.</v>

1143
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.410
<v Speaker 3>All that is about narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it is narrative.</v>

1144
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:47.420
<v Speaker 3>I only chose it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested.</v>

1145
00:58:47.421 --> 00:58:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very into Freud,</v>

1146
00:58:48.951 --> 00:58:49.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those case studies.</v>

1147
00:58:49.821 --> 00:58:51.530
<v Speaker 3>We'd like short stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1148
00:58:51.531 --> 00:58:53.030
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take Shakespeare.</v>

1149
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why would shakespeare choose this </v>

1150
00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>form?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is limited,</v>

1151
00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:00.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's got five back.</v>

1152
00:59:00.111 --> 00:59:03.050
<v Speaker 3>He basically wrote a highly convention </v>
<v Speaker 3>bound,</v>

1153
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 3>highly structured narrative driven form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes tipping into propaganda that </v>

1154
00:59:09.321 --> 00:59:12.950
<v Speaker 3>deals with last intriguing murderer </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to sell out the most,</v>

1155
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the most seats in the globe theater</v>

1156
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 3>to put asses in chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had no interest in enduring literary </v>

1157
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1158
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are interested in during</v>

1159
00:59:22.491 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 3>literary value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't enduring,</v>

1160
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 3>we don't tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enduro is another discussion,</v>

1161
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:30.820
<v Speaker 3>but when you cut that glue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1162
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cut the globe theater and half and </v>

1163
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a perfect cross section of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth and society.</v>

1164
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 3>So I'll have a joke from audit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>metamorphosis and then he'll make a dick</v>

1165
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 3>joke for the groundlings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to appeal everywhere.</v>

1166
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 3>And within the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1167
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1168
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.480
<v Speaker 3>within the constraints of the form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a liberation.</v>

1169
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:55.481
<v Speaker 3>So he takes the Jew of Malta in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the merchant of Venice in very few </v>

1170
00:59:55.481 --> 00:59:56.690
<v Speaker 3>original plots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1171
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this reworking of trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something that's great within a </v>

1172
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.431
<v Speaker 3>form that's recognizable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's recognizable because </v>

1173
01:00:06.431 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 3>it's pleasingly archetypal and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget,</v>

1174
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1175
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 3>this can movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Stranger was,</v>

1176
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:14.570
<v Speaker 3>was inspired by James and Keynes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Postman always rings twice,</v>

1177
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 3>like these forms are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1178
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:16.840
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1179
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.380
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1180
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 3>these chandler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1181
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's an enormous amount and it's </v>

1182
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.231
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been said quite often that that </v>

1183
01:00:32.231 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 3>door is modern tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead of falling from the throne,</v>

1184
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 3>you're falling from the curb into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gutter,</v>

1185
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1186
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:40.210
<v Speaker 3>You're just starting lower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also been said the crime fiction </v>

1187
01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 3>has replaced the social novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at,</v>

1188
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1189
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 3>you look at like Mr wherever from Dennis</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lehane,</v>

1190
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's such an interesting story,</v>

1191
01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1192
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a book called town allies takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>place in San Francisco that is built </v>

1193
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.391
<v Speaker 3>around a thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all about class in society and </v>

1194
01:00:58.391 --> 01:00:59.390
<v Speaker 3>ethics in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in a weird way for me,</v>

1195
01:00:59.391 --> 01:01:02.630
<v Speaker 3>when I'm playing with these notions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimacy versus perfection,</v>

1196
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 3>when I'm playing with this notion of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1197
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.960
<v Speaker 3>aging versus focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1198
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.860
<v Speaker 3>the themes around humanity about being </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1199
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>if I can wrap them in what I hope is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormously entertaining page turning </v>

1200
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 3>story that's propulsive that people want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to read.</v>

1201
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of thing that I most </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy and engage in that for me,</v>

1202
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:28.010
<v Speaker 3>sort of the ultimate win.</v>

1203
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get to write about </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that I want to write about in</v>

1204
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:35.531
<v Speaker 3>as exciting and compelling fashion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can manage within the restraints of my</v>

1205
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't do that as having a ceiling.</v>

1206
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone's going to come </v>

1207
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:43.920
<v Speaker 3>along and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1208
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mcbath pretty lacking on the,</v>

1209
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 3>on the quality scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1210
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's always an aim for it.</v>

1211
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>And also I just love thrillers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:57.161
<v Speaker 3>instead of writing a thriller with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat on the bones where I'm really </v>

1213
01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.040
<v Speaker 3>stretching and there there's a number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do it in the forum.</v>

1214
01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.240
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only one,</v>

1215
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a great,</v>

1216
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a great focus and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1217
01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 3>if you don't focus on something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you wind up?</v>

1218
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 3>And also look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this goes back to narrative to </v>

1219
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.731
<v Speaker 3>archetypal narrative too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I believe that there are </v>

1220
01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:18.161
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally fundamental story </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures and that our is selected for </v>

1221
01:02:18.161 --> 01:02:19.320
<v Speaker 3>as opposable thumbs and islands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1222
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 3>and I think</v>

1223
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 5>you'll find a tribe that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1224
01:02:22.561 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ted no exposure.</v>

1225
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:26.280
<v Speaker 5>And we'll have eyelids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>opposable thumbs,</v>

1226
01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:29.130
<v Speaker 5>and a hero archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the archetype.</v>

1227
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Gilgamesh is a thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1228
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Beowulf is a kick ass thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what those things are.</v>

1229
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 5>And that's the form that just appeals to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1230
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moses,</v>

1231
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 5>the exodus is the thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1232
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:41.700
<v Speaker 5>The Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1233
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:46.701
<v Speaker 5>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I collect faulkner paperbacks from the </v>

1234
01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:48.981
<v Speaker 5>fifties and they're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they have these Harlequin type </v>

1235
01:02:48.981 --> 01:02:49.480
<v Speaker 5>covers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1236
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 5>like another from America's leading </v>
<v Speaker 5>purveyor of murder and lust.</v>

1237
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 5>William Faulkner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1238
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:59.691
<v Speaker 5>they were packaged as such,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you read sanctuary with the </v>

1239
01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 5>courtroom case and the corn cob.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>certain genre conventions as originally </v>

1244
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 5>went to Hollywood and adapted Chandler </v>
<v Speaker 5>novels.</v>

1245
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1246
01:03:10.511 --> 01:03:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1247

<v Speaker 5>I mean he already slug away.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

1255
01:03:31.781 --> 01:03:36.781
<v Speaker 5>I am a structure slot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think structure is essential structure</v>

1256
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.200
<v Speaker 5>slumped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch me structure slut and fun and </v>

1257
01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.480
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that'll be my website instead of young </v>

1258
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.940
<v Speaker 5>women who are symmetrically perfect and </v>
<v Speaker 5>represent a particular gummy and ideal.</v>

1259
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1260
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I like to know where I am </v>
<v Speaker 5>within a story.</v>

1261
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to,</v>

1262
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to know where the terms are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1263
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 5>I like to play with them lies with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Batman.</v>

1264
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 5>We talked about once you have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conventions,</v>

1265
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:09.621
<v Speaker 5>you can start to play with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can start to find more elbow room </v>

1266
01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:09.621
<v Speaker 5>within them.</v>

1267
01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a nice thing too is that </v>

1268
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.010
<v Speaker 2>people often think about creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom as the freedom for many </v>

1269
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 2>structural impositions whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1270
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.760
<v Speaker 2>that's the Peter Pan thing or what did </v>
<v Speaker 2>you call your character?</v>

1271
01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1272
01:04:22.661 --> 01:04:24.530
<v Speaker 2>casserole casserole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1273
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 2>without obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And without limits,</v>

1274
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:31.080
<v Speaker 2>you have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't just have chaos.</v>

1275
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I have like,</v>

1276
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having written all these novels and the </v>

1277
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:37.680
<v Speaker 5>nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1278
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.650
<v Speaker 5>there's one novel did something really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

1279
01:04:38.651 --> 01:04:43.651
<v Speaker 5>there's one chapter that something </v>
<v Speaker 5>really bad happens to Evan and each </v>

1280
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:47.641
<v Speaker 5>chapter in the orphan accent in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Norman has a title that's taken from </v>

1281
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:51.901
<v Speaker 5>something in the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually a sort of humorous way that it </v>

1282
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:56.671
<v Speaker 5>can be double rent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a phrase from the chapter as a </v>

1283
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:58.881
<v Speaker 5>chapter heading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the chapters after this </v>

1284
01:04:58.881 --> 01:05:01.561
<v Speaker 5>horrific thing happen to evan is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>cold and the whole chapter is just the </v>

1285
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:02.950
<v Speaker 5>word cold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole chapter.</v>

1286
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.020
<v Speaker 5>So one more chapter and then you move </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1287
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:08.140
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not conventional writing.</v>

1288
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1289
01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:12.970
<v Speaker 5>there's ways that you can start to play </v>
<v Speaker 5>once you're within it,</v>

1290
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.880
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to write in a whole,</v>

1291
01:05:15.881 --> 01:05:20.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>book in Haiku and like the mass </v>

1292
01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:24.211
<v Speaker 5>experimentation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a book called a crime writer </v>

1293
01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:27.510
<v Speaker 5>where I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a crime writer who lands on </v>

1294
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.250
<v Speaker 5>something that's in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>seemingly one of his own story.</v>

1295
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 5>He's a disaster situation and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>realizes that in order to understand </v>

1296
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 5>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has to write it down.</v>

1297
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:38.190
<v Speaker 5>So then I introduced a typewriter font.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the first sentence of the book </v>

1298
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.790
<v Speaker 5>that we read or the first paragraph of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the book.</v>

1299
01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:44.791
<v Speaker 5>And then at a certain point his editor </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes in and has hand written edits in </v>

1300
01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:48.631
<v Speaker 5>the margins of the typewriter so that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>see the development process of the </v>

1301
01:05:48.631 --> 01:05:52.831
<v Speaker 5>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which mirrors the process of his own </v>

1302
01:05:52.831 --> 01:05:55.891
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is the story of what happened to </v>

1303
01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:55.891
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has been all of that.</v>

1304
01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:58.831
<v Speaker 5>We're reading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's all these ways that you can </v>

1305
01:05:58.831 --> 01:05:58.831
<v Speaker 5>play within the form to make an </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1306
01:05:58.831 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to know where I am in a story.</v>

1307
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 5>That's what always appeals to me.</v>

1308
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

1309
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.150
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1310
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I'd like you to talk a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your career from a practical sense</v>

1311
01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:14.190
<v Speaker 2>too because you've been able to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for a long time.</v>

1312
01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:20.220
<v Speaker 2>So I think people would be interested to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what your typical,</v>

1313
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:25.140
<v Speaker 2>how you learn to write and what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>typical day looks like.</v>

1314
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we're passing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the last 20 years because one of </v>

1315
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.921
<v Speaker 2>the strange things about being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent artist is that you don't </v>

1316
01:06:36.871 --> 01:06:41.871
<v Speaker 2>have those external constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely driving you the same way that </v>

1317
01:06:41.871 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to go to work everyday.</v>

1318
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:47.090
<v Speaker 2>If you have to be up at nine for someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else and it's very easy for people to </v>

1319
01:06:47.431 --> 01:06:52.431
<v Speaker 2>drift in a situation like that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always put off what you have to </v>

1320
01:06:52.431 --> 01:06:56.361
<v Speaker 2>do until tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could also always substitute the </v>

1321
01:06:56.361 --> 01:06:56.361
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium,</v>

1322
01:06:56.361 --> 01:07:00.921
<v Speaker 2>or longer term ambition for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>short term that needs to be done right </v>

1323
01:07:00.921 --> 01:07:05.121
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's start out by how you learn to </v>

1324
01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:05.121
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

1325
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I never did a writing course or read a </v>
<v Speaker 3>book on writing.</v>

1326
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you learn to write a novel,</v>

1327
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>2000 novels and then you try and write </v>

1328
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 5>one and screw it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1329
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Same with screenplays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1330
01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 5>watch a million movies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Love the thing itself.</v>

1331
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.260
<v Speaker 5>My first book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a disastrous first draft.</v>

1332
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the end of each chapter was better than </v>

1333
01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:34.081
<v Speaker 5>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally from what I've learned while </v>

1334
01:07:34.081 --> 01:07:34.081
<v Speaker 5>writing the chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

1335
01:07:34.081 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Speaker 5>don't be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had two things that have benefited </v>

1336
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Speaker 5>me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is I'm not afraid to fail,</v>

1337
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm not afraid to embarrass myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1338
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:45.980
<v Speaker 5>and I also don't have any delay between </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanting to try something and trying it.</v>

1339
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't hold back and wait and </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about it.</v>

1340
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 5>And I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to write a novel.</v>

1341
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:53.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm 19.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I know more than I do.</v>

1342
01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to jump in and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote it.</v>

1343
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:57.940
<v Speaker 5>I had a really shitty first draft,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vomit draft.</v>

1344
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 5>I sat down and took it apart like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>engine block and then I looked at it all</v>

1345
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:04.420
<v Speaker 5>and reconstructed as,</v>

1346
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.520
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean exactly?</v>

1347
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of just kind of chapter by </v>
<v Speaker 5>chapter and like this plot isn't working</v>

1348
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:17.401
<v Speaker 5>and this is two longest stretch without </v>
<v Speaker 5>action and this character developed </v>

1349
01:08:17.401 --> 01:08:17.401
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1350
01:08:17.401 --> 01:08:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I took the chapters out and it felt like</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did it.</v>

1351
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 5>My first draft was half the length of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the final model.</v>

1352
01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:28.170
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't till my third novel that I </v>

1353
01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 5>wrote a rough draft that could </v>
<v Speaker 5>constitute an awful on its own.</v>

1354
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 5>It's functioned.</v>

1355
01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of what you were doing was </v>

1356
01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:37.600
<v Speaker 2>separating the production end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process from the editing end.</v>

1357
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1358
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:41.460
<v Speaker 2>that's what a bad first draft doses you </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow it.</v>

1359
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:42.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1360
01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:44.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then as I get further along,</v>

1361
01:08:44.801 --> 01:08:49.110
<v Speaker 5>it's like I like my first draft now is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what my 10th draft used to be.</v>

1362
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It keeps it,</v>

1363
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.730
<v Speaker 5>it keeps sort of evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then know all,</v>

1364
01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:58.740
<v Speaker 5>try something new like orphan x.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did more rewriting on than any of my </v>

1365
01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.131
<v Speaker 5>previous six books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It still wasn't anywhere close to my </v>

1366
01:09:02.131 --> 01:09:02.131
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1367
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:07.110
<v Speaker 5>three dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I really was doing something new,</v>

1368
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.120
<v Speaker 5>I was building an entire character and </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire mythology and launching this big </v>

1369
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:17.490
<v Speaker 5>new franchise into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so in some ways I overrode it and </v>

1370
01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.120
<v Speaker 5>pull stuff back that I save for future </v>
<v Speaker 5>books.</v>

1371
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'd say that's one part of it.</v>

1372
01:09:21.011 --> 01:09:25.320
<v Speaker 5>The other is I think it might've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>advised you gave me when I was shadowing</v>

1373
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.340
<v Speaker 5>or 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you said when it comes to writing </v>

1374
01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:30.580
<v Speaker 5>and if you didn't say we can just </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretend that you did.</v>

1375
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:35.580
<v Speaker 5>We'll give you credit for gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking credit that then you leave </v>

1376
01:09:38.141 --> 01:09:39.340
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's not wise,</v>

1377
01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 5>then they'll be like Wiley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coyote out over the cliff.</v>

1378
01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Just watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all know.</v>

1379
01:09:43.331 --> 01:09:48.160
<v Speaker 5>But you said there's always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>a dozen things that are more pressing to</v>

1380
01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:49.090
<v Speaker 5>do then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1381
01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.360
<v Speaker 5>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't decide to make that </v>

1382
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 5>time sort of holy and protected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody else will do that for you.</v>

1383
01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.800
<v Speaker 5>And that's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was already kind of into my first </v>

1384
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.430
<v Speaker 5>book and doing it and I thought that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly right.</v>

1385
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Like it's always more pressing to clean </v>
<v Speaker 5>the house or pick up your dry cleaning </v>

1386
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:12.391
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick up one of your kids if you don't </v>

1387
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:12.391
<v Speaker 5>just carve it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I'm a surgeon,</v>

1388
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:17.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm in an office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those monster surgeons where I'm </v>

1389
01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:17.890
<v Speaker 5>in an office and no one can reach me.</v>

1390
01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:22.890
<v Speaker 5>And my day is sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean at any time right now I could be </v>

1391
01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:24.520
<v Speaker 5>disturbed all the time by anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My phone can ring.</v>

1392
01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.650
<v Speaker 5>So unless I say this is my writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>schedule,</v>

1393
01:10:26.651 --> 01:10:28.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm unplugged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1394
01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:33.181
<v Speaker 5>kids leave me alone unless someone is on</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire or the house is on fire and it is </v>

1395
01:10:33.181 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need the same amount of space that I </v>

1396
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.350
<v Speaker 5>would have Brian Accountant or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologist or you know,</v>

1397
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.080
<v Speaker 5>a doctor or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1398
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.000
<v Speaker 5>And so I had to make that time kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>holy are sacrosanct.</v>

1399
01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:51.660
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say the other thing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that mattered a lot is I realized early </v>

1400
01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:54.130
<v Speaker 5>on that the one thing I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's two other pieces that I'll say.</v>

1401
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.700
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that I could control </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely was discipline.</v>

1402
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.680
<v Speaker 5>That's the only controllable thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such an impossible field and so you</v>

1403
01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:03.880
<v Speaker 5>have to wait for luck.</v>

1404
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.440
<v Speaker 5>And I had a lot of luck early,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I don't say with false humility or</v>

1405
01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:13.441
<v Speaker 5>fishing for compliments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my first book was good and I think </v>

1406
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 5>it was sellable and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>first books that good in sellable.</v>

1407
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 5>You never know when that luck's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>come.</v>

1408
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:21.140
<v Speaker 5>And I thought in sort of work ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I flap my wings as hard as I could </v>

1409
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 5>that I'm just bumping along the ceiling </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

1410
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 5>The one moment that that hatch opens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the lucky break comes,</v>

1411
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 5>I was going to be right there to fly </v>
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>

1412
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.420
<v Speaker 5>And so from day one I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going full speed all the way no </v>

1413
01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 5>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I still do.</v>

1414
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:40.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still feel like the one thing I can </v>

1415
01:11:40.911 --> 01:11:40.911
<v Speaker 5>control is I've never been late on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>deadline,</v>

1416
01:11:40.911 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I write all day every day I built it</v>

1417
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 5>up like a muscle.</v>

1418
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.990
<v Speaker 5>So how much time do you spend writing in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a date now?</v>

1419
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 5>At minimum I write from six to 4:30</v>
<v Speaker 5>or five on laundry days.</v>

1420
01:11:53.011 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 5>If I'm on deadline or if I'm near the </v>
<v Speaker 5>end of a book and I can smell it,</v>

1421
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 5>it will be 13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

1422
01:11:57.991 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes 16 hours.</v>

1423
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:02.850
<v Speaker 5>And I've had spells of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

1424
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 5>I once wrote a script for a TV show and </v>
<v Speaker 5>1:23</v>

1425
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:11.211
<v Speaker 5>hours sitting because there was a risk </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a micro economy in Vancouver would </v>

1426
01:12:11.211 --> 01:12:12.500
<v Speaker 5>shut down if I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's a shutdown,</v>

1427
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 5>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's problematic.</v>

1428
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:20.030
<v Speaker 5>So I can go when I go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at a minimum I'm writing all day </v>

1429
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.030
<v Speaker 5>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1430
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:24.710
<v Speaker 5>with a break to work out in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing I'd say is really </v>

1431
01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:24.710
<v Speaker 5>interesting is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1432
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:30.350
<v Speaker 5>it's funny seeing which values get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people look at my resume and I went </v>

1433
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:34.971
<v Speaker 5>to all these fancy schools and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>always ask me like they asked me about </v>

1434
01:12:34.971 --> 01:12:38.841
<v Speaker 5>Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the throughout my educational </v>

1435
01:12:38.841 --> 01:12:38.841
<v Speaker 5>background.</v>

1436
01:12:38.841 --> 01:12:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You studied English and here you went </v>

1437
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:43.281
<v Speaker 5>and did a masters in England.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in some ways one of the biggest </v>

1438
01:12:43.281 --> 01:12:47.121
<v Speaker 5>values for me was being was came from </v>
<v Speaker 5>being an athlete because I was a pole </v>

1439
01:12:47.121 --> 01:12:47.750
<v Speaker 5>vaulter in college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1440
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.760
<v Speaker 5>I played soccer growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I played soccer in England and writing </v>

1441
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 5>is like training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like working out.</v>

1442
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:59.540
<v Speaker 5>It's building a muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as with pole vaulting when I was </v>

1443
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.961
<v Speaker 5>training day 27,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the heptathlon will championships </v>

1444
01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:07.071
<v Speaker 5>were on day 275,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have 100 things more important to do </v>

1445
01:13:07.071 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 5>than train on day 27 and know that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to go that far.</v>

1446
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.440
<v Speaker 5>That's like a 27 or writing a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1447
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:17.450
<v Speaker 5>And so there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people undervalue the value </v>

1448
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 5>sports now for health and for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1449
01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:23.271
<v Speaker 5>being active and being well rounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't tend to talk about the </v>

1450
01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:24.690
<v Speaker 5>values that they instill and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like discipline,</v>

1451
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.730
<v Speaker 5>longterm planning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1452
01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:31.731
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was in high school I sucked at </v>

1453
01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:31.731
<v Speaker 5>pole vaulting.</v>

1454
01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean my whole first year I was too </v>
<v Speaker 5>small to bend the pole.</v>

1455
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:38.330
<v Speaker 5>Sophomore year it was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're talking to is a three year </v>

1456
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.170
<v Speaker 5>process to build up to start jumping at </v>
<v Speaker 5>a high level and eventually,</v>

1457
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a national level and then in college.</v>

1458
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:47.540
<v Speaker 5>But it takes a lot of discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's the discipline aspect of </v>

1459
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.560
<v Speaker 5>writing I think is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1460
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people starting out,</v>

1461
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:56.210
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick a certain amount of time that you </v>

1462
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 5>do no matter what and force yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get stuff on the page.</v>

1463
01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 5>And if you say all I could find is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>hour day or two hours a day,</v>

1464
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'm sorry,</v>

1465
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:04.200
<v Speaker 5>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twice a week.</v>

1466
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.620
<v Speaker 5>That will soon turn into two hours and </v>
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes or two hours and two and a </v>

1467
01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 5>half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will expand itself as your discipline</v>

1468
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 5>goes on.</v>

1469
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like running and the other thing I </v>
<v Speaker 5>say is that,</v>

1470
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.160
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean a lot of people who want to be </v>

1471
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:20.160
<v Speaker 5>writers and I meet very few who actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to write.</v>

1472
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.420
<v Speaker 5>I love writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually loved the writing process.</v>

1473
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 5>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do this.</v>

1474
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:32.730
<v Speaker 5>There's a million other things you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>do and make more money and it's easier </v>

1475
01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 5>and you can be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you say you love it,</v>

1476
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.240
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that doesn't mean it's easy by </v>

1477
01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 5>any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it mean exactly?</v>

1478
01:14:41.771 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean by that?</v>

1479
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1480
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 5>it's the one place I really clearly lose</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1481
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when things are going well,</v>

1482
01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 5>an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two hours will pass.</v>

1483
01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 5>That happens to me when I'm on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soccer field.</v>

1484
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 5>Two is like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel fully inhabited in something else</v>

1485
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:04.360
<v Speaker 5>aside from me in a manner that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive and I feel like I don't.</v>

1486
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:09.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one for getting precious about </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing with beckoning menus and </v>

1487
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:11.260
<v Speaker 5>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like there's an ask,</v>

1488
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:16.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a part of pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have these really loud keyboards that </v>

1489
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.561
<v Speaker 5>I hammer on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've a whole broken slu or keyboards </v>

1490
01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 5>that I've gone through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like a carpenter,</v>

1491
01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:24.781
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm pounding and hammering </v>
<v Speaker 5>and cutting and pasting and I liked the </v>

1492
01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:28.441
<v Speaker 5>keyboard to be really loud so then it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a muscular action and I just feel </v>

1493
01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 5>utterly engaged and fascinated in what </v>
<v Speaker 5>in this world that like I'm in control,</v>

1494
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:38.100
<v Speaker 5>but there's endless opportunities and my</v>
<v Speaker 5>job is to be open to opportunity while </v>

1495
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:42.331
<v Speaker 5>also making sure that I'm kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>steering the ship and there's an </v>

1496
01:15:42.331 --> 01:15:45.511
<v Speaker 5>enormous amount of responsibility and at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same time I'm living in a world of </v>

1497
01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 5>my own making and holy alone.</v>

1498
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:52.660
<v Speaker 5>So first let's hear your keyboard.</v>

1499
01:15:56.910 --> 01:16:01.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just like the 19 thirties newsroom </v>

1500
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:02.720
<v Speaker 5>or if my friends joke with me about as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

1501
01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.500
<v Speaker 5>When they're on the phone and if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>rude enough to be writing or finishing a</v>

1502
01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:12.501
<v Speaker 5>sentence there would say you sound like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the asshole travel agent where they </v>

1503
01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:12.870
<v Speaker 5>can't move your flight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

1504
01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.430
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so Dallas has shut down.</v>

1505
01:16:14.431 --> 01:16:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Can I go through Chicago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1506
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:18.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm terribly sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can Be an issue.</v>

1507
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.160
<v Speaker 5>Can we get me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1508
01:16:20.161 --> 01:16:22.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your flight's been delayed six hours.</v>

1509
01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:27.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's still loud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Old fashioned angry travel agent </v>

1510
01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:27.260
<v Speaker 5>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1511
01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very funny.</v>

1512
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your toe.</v>

1513
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you talked about discipline and you </v>

1514
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.050
<v Speaker 5>talked about responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're writing,</v>

1515
01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:39.390
<v Speaker 5>like what do you mean by that exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1516
01:16:39.391 --> 01:16:43.440
<v Speaker 5>your ego is constantly subservient to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the plot,</v>

1517
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:48.470
<v Speaker 5>so to write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you come up with a basic set of </v>

1518
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.660
<v Speaker 5>tenants that start your story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1519
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.500
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1520
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.360
<v Speaker 5>it's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1521
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.970
<v Speaker 5>it's like surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's so many factors.</v>

1522
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.620
<v Speaker 5>So when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1523
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.720
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's sort of like the idiot criticism</v>

1524
01:16:57.721 --> 01:17:01.380
<v Speaker 5>of certain movies like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>passenger,</v>

1525
01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:06.381
<v Speaker 5>57,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you remember where Wesley Snipes is the </v>

1526
01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:08.571
<v Speaker 5>super bad ass Spec ops guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>airplane that gets hijacked and some </v>

1527
01:17:08.571 --> 01:17:11.691
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what are the odds that you'd be on </v>

1528
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:11.691
<v Speaker 5>plane that got hijacked?</v>

1529
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:11.691
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1530
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 3>it's 100 percent because no one wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write a story about the other 99,000,</v>

1531
01:17:15.771 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 3>999 times that a plane got hijacked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>passenger 57 wasn't on it.</v>

1532
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why we're writing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1533
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.650
<v Speaker 3>So you have a unique set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances that can involve,</v>

1534
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 3>that can involve coincidence at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outset.</v>

1535
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.590
<v Speaker 3>That's first act stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1536
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.030
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1537
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:37.031
<v Speaker 3>this is a story about the one time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>an orphan who was taken out of her </v>

1538
01:17:37.031 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 3>program at the age of 12 and trained to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be an assassin,</v>

1539
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left the program because his moral </v>

1540
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:44.560
<v Speaker 3>compass was broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's his story.</v>

1541
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like whatever you think the odds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

1542
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:51.940
<v Speaker 3>that's the narrative contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm doing and I can't </v>

1543
01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 3>introduce them in the third act of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>realism based mystery.</v>

1544
01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:56.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a drawing room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

1545
01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.790
<v Speaker 3>that takes place in Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we set the course of that.</v>

1546
01:17:58.820 --> 01:17:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1547
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 2>So that's the contract with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative contract and the contract with</v>

1548
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 2>the reader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to break.</v>

1549
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1550
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 2>give me leeway while I set this up.</v>

1551
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the coincidence,</v>

1552
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:16.350
<v Speaker 3>the coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or here's the unlikely set of </v>

1553
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:19.521
<v Speaker 3>circumstances that are why I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to sit down at my type </v>

1554
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:23.100
<v Speaker 3>typewriter sounding keyboard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>devoting your life to this.</v>

1555
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're all in on that.</v>

1556
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Then you round out your characters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want us to give them freedom.</v>

1557
01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 3>But you're also steering like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe all this stuff that </v>

1558
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1559
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.901
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just start to channel everything and </v>

1560
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:38.901
<v Speaker 3>it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're controlling it.</v>

1561
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:39.360
<v Speaker 3>But when I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1562
01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:43.230
<v Speaker 3>I have characters who are wittier than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am in real time.</v>

1563
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Not Meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that's great with</v>

1564
01:18:45.181 --> 01:18:50.181
<v Speaker 3>writing books is that a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back with the perfect comeback to,</v>

1565
01:18:51.091 --> 01:18:51.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1566
01:18:51.661 --> 01:18:54.240
<v Speaker 3>like I have a year to come up with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>polished the dialogue.</v>

1567
01:18:54.241 --> 01:18:59.241
<v Speaker 3>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whenever you've been in a party and </v>

1568
01:18:59.241 --> 01:18:59.241
<v Speaker 3>someone slights here when you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>home going,</v>

1569
01:18:59.241 --> 01:18:59.940
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have said that.</v>

1570
01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.170
<v Speaker 3>We get to say that when we're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've had that happen in real time.</v>

1571
01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:07.410
<v Speaker 3>So there's something that starts to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>on with characters as you engage in them</v>

1572
01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 3>that they're doing stuff that I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm typing just behind it </v>

1573
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's just moving and that's a great</v>

1574
01:19:14.701 --> 01:19:17.880
<v Speaker 3>feeling and there's this really weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you want to get to,</v>

1575
01:19:17.881 --> 01:19:22.881
<v Speaker 3>which is by the end of a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion should feel at once </v>

1576
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:26.991
<v Speaker 3>inevitable and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to have things happen and </v>

1577
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:32.750
<v Speaker 3>we've all had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if some people had it with </v>

1578
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:34.380
<v Speaker 3>the success some people had it with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've all had that feeling in a movie or</v>

1579
01:19:34.381 --> 01:19:39.381
<v Speaker 3>reading a book where you're right on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lip of discovery and then the thing </v>

1580
01:19:39.381 --> 01:19:39.630
<v Speaker 3>happens and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1581
01:19:39.631 --> 01:19:43.390
<v Speaker 3>that makes so much sense and completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught me off guard at the same time.</v>

1582
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:45.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1583
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.100
<v Speaker 3>And so you need to sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a responsibility to always make</v>

1584
01:19:50.101 --> 01:19:54.450
<v Speaker 3>your needs subservient to the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the story is paramount.</v>

1585
01:19:55.170 --> 01:20:00.170
<v Speaker 3>And so as much as you're the creator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give free will to the story.</v>

1586
01:20:00.241 --> 01:20:04.050
<v Speaker 3>You have to give stuff up that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wouldn't otherwise.</v>

1587
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I might have spent weeks research on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something</v>

1588
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 5>if it doesn't fit the story per our </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly,</v>

1589
01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 5>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1590
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:12.990
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call it killing your babies,</v>

1591
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to get rid of it,</v>

1592
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:16.170
<v Speaker 5>you got to throw it out and you have to.</v>

1593
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.370
<v Speaker 2>It's really useful for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1594
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.590
<v Speaker 2>beginning writers to know that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched on previously,</v>

1595
01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.620
<v Speaker 2>which is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be willing to throw things </v>

1596
01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:26.750
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of things.</v>

1597
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I do to kind of take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sting out of that to some degree is I </v>

1598
01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:35.540
<v Speaker 2>always have a document open on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer called Kols and I'll pull out a</v>

1599
01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:38.540
<v Speaker 2>paragraph that doesn't fit and throw it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and you know,</v>

1600
01:20:38.541 --> 01:20:41.360
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility that I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a place for it later.</v>

1601
01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 2>But often I do something with it later </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1602
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So the writing is necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1603
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1604
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.960
<v Speaker 5>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to make everything work </v>

1605
01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.690
<v Speaker 5>and you're trying to be surprising at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same time.</v>

1606
01:20:56.691 --> 01:20:59.270
<v Speaker 5>But also you have to be open to </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity.</v>

1607
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:04.271
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had my third book in particular learn </v>

1608
01:21:04.271 --> 01:21:06.880
<v Speaker 5>this because I got all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>end and the ending that I thought was </v>

1609
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.301
<v Speaker 5>the exact opposite of the ending of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story that I had created and I realized </v>

1610
01:21:10.301 --> 01:21:14.741
<v Speaker 5>I had a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can either honor the story that I've </v>

1611
01:21:14.741 --> 01:21:17.021
<v Speaker 5>created and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and make this thing that's better and </v>

1612
01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:18.620
<v Speaker 5>surprising and unplanned for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I can write propaganda,</v>

1613
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.480
<v Speaker 5>I can see purpose story to my own means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like that's like,</v>

1614
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:23.810
<v Speaker 5>that's an brand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1615
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's never going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>shocking reveal where they're,</v>

1616
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:28.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in an an brand,</v>

1617
01:21:28.281 --> 01:21:30.320
<v Speaker 5>you know what it is and she's filling it</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1618
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:35.950
<v Speaker 5>You know what all of her thoughts are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the writing for is in a process of </v>

1619
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:39.281
<v Speaker 5>discovery necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a process of furthering the set of </v>

1620
01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:39.281
<v Speaker 5>philosophical points</v>

1621
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 2>she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's second rate,</v>

1622
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I think is that all her heroes and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>her villains,</v>

1623
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.600
<v Speaker 2>like all her heroes are the same hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all her villains are the same </v>

1624
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.411
<v Speaker 2>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the villains are completely </v>

1625
01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:56.631
<v Speaker 2>villainous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the heroes are completely </v>

1626
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:56.631
<v Speaker 2>heroic.</v>

1627
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:56.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>snaps.</v>

1628
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:56.631
<v Speaker 5>Propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1629
01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:57.010
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1630
01:21:57.011 --> 01:21:59.740
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the opposite of Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1631
01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:04.741
<v Speaker 2>where he makes his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his villains are more heroic than his </v>

1632
01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:06.870
<v Speaker 2>heroes by a substantial margin he makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>superman to,</v>

1633
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.460
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to argue against fundamentally.</v>

1634
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1635
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one is about being open and the other </v>

1636
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.150
<v Speaker 5>thing I would say with writers is I see </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot here who were,</v>

1637
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is true for,</v>

1638
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank for artistic feel and </v>

1639
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:24.160
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1640
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 5>I went to beverly hills high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I studied screenwriting Undergrad,</v>

1641
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I got a masters in screenwriting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>here I go and I'm ready to go and I want</v>

1642
01:22:30.991 --> 01:22:31.680
<v Speaker 5>to write.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

1643
01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:36.681
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell are you going to write </v>

1644
01:22:36.681 --> 01:22:36.681
<v Speaker 5>about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1645
01:22:36.681 --> 01:22:38.781
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think having a broad range of life </v>

1646
01:22:38.781 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 5>experiences important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1647
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 5>there's some of the writers who I admire</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most.</v>

1648
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Like James Ellroy was like borderline </v>
<v Speaker 5>homeless,</v>

1649
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:48.770
<v Speaker 5>not homeless for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just knocking about and figuring stuff </v>

1650
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.280
<v Speaker 5>out and on jobs and like living out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

1651
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.940
<v Speaker 5>And so if you want to write this or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

1652
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:57.950
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or create some sort of constructed </v>

1653
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:58.320
<v Speaker 5>amalgam of previous things that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been constructed,</v>

1654
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 5>go all the way through all the course </v>
<v Speaker 5>work and do all that.</v>

1655
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 5>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1656
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 5>it's huge benefit to just pursue </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that interests</v>

1657
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.060
<v Speaker 3>you because looking back it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I chose young,</v>

1658
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking in hindsight it's like,</v>

1659
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 3>well no shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1660
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:15.910
<v Speaker 3>He didn't write about anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>storytelling,</v>

1661
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:20.530
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't choose him in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember even in college,</v>

1662
01:23:20.531 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 3>so I was an English and psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I,</v>

1663
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.440
<v Speaker 3>I sort of wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1664
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I took a course in opera and I took a </v>
<v Speaker 3>course in classical music.</v>

1665
01:23:27.881 --> 01:23:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I have zero aptitude for music,</v>

1666
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.410
<v Speaker 3>but I really was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1667
01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.380
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in art and all these different arenas to</v>

1668
01:23:35.381 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 3>just have at least have a basis of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to write about.</v>

1669
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think the same is true for life </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1670
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:46.081
<v Speaker 3>Like do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff do stuff that's </v>

1671
01:23:46.081 --> 01:23:46.081
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1672
01:23:46.081 --> 01:23:46.500
<v Speaker 2>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1673
01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.990
<v Speaker 2>so we should fill in a backstory here </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people too,</v>

1674
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.730
<v Speaker 2>because I imagine there are somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>curious,</v>

1675
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've known you for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We met when you were a student at </v>

1676
01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.301
<v Speaker 2>Harvard when I was teaching there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually the only one of the </v>

1677
01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:03.681
<v Speaker 2>undergraduates that I knew there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kept up a relationship with over </v>

1678
01:24:03.681 --> 01:24:04.830
<v Speaker 2>this protracted period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1679
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:07.380
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a variety of reasons,</v>

1680
01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:12.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like I didn't meet all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of remarkable undergraduates </v>

1681
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.690
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1682
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:13.970
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1683
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any particular memories of </v>

1684
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:19.360
<v Speaker 2>that period of time when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting?</v>

1685
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I can certainly tell one story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll see what you come up with </v>

1686
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

1687
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember you were,</v>

1688
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I remember you were formal in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respected that because I still </v>

1689
01:24:32.341 --> 01:24:37.341
<v Speaker 3>remember we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were friends or seeing each other </v>

1690
01:24:37.341 --> 01:24:37.341
<v Speaker 3>outside of school for like four years </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I finally was like,</v>

1691
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:40.170
<v Speaker 3>is it okay if I call you Jordan instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Dr Peter said,</v>

1692
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.520
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1693
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:44.300
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the formals,</v>

1694
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:45.660
<v Speaker 3>maybe the wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1695
01:24:45.661 --> 01:24:46.230
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1696
01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.780
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a certain authority that I think</v>

1697
01:24:48.781 --> 01:24:53.781
<v Speaker 3>was key to the teaching process and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't Brooke Fools,</v>

1698
01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm an all like if someone came in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>an argument from either end of the </v>

1699
01:25:00.391 --> 01:25:01.960
<v Speaker 3>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1700
01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 3>from an ideological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had no interest in us.</v>

1701
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.940
<v Speaker 3>And so that was really palatable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think what happened with,</v>

1702
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:13.970
<v Speaker 3>with young was that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sort of fell in love with all of </v>

1703
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:14.700
<v Speaker 3>that for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just,</v>

1704
01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1705
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:20.050
<v Speaker 3>it's weird how much our interests </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned along those fronts because I had</v>

1706
01:25:20.161 --> 01:25:25.161
<v Speaker 3>been very interested obviously in </v>
<v Speaker 3>storytelling and thrillers and all this </v>

1707
01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:28.221
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dealing with young and dealing with </v>

1708
01:25:28.221 --> 01:25:28.221
<v Speaker 3>the shadow.</v>

1709
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.320
<v Speaker 2>We encountered some early political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness there together.</v>

1710
01:25:31.321 --> 01:25:36.321
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were in the English </v>

1711
01:25:36.321 --> 01:25:38.391
<v Speaker 2>department and you were studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and you wanted to study </v>

1712
01:25:38.391 --> 01:25:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare from a union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I remember correctly,</v>

1713
01:25:41.071 --> 01:25:44.430
<v Speaker 2>at that time Shakespeare wasn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular in the English department and,</v>

1714
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.350
<v Speaker 2>and you was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1715
01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi.</v>

1716
01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1717
01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.700
<v Speaker 2>The very opposite of popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was also very interesting.</v>

1718
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when I was hitting a lot of that </v>

1719
01:25:59.850 --> 01:25:59.850
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it wasn't,</v>

1720
01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:01.650
<v Speaker 3>it didn't feel like it was the pitch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was now,</v>

1721
01:26:01.651 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 3>but it was at a sort of nineties were.</v>

1722
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 5>And it also felt kind of more </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting where like,</v>

1723
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 5>it felt more conversational,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a weird way.</v>

1724
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 5>Like where people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I had my favorite feminist,</v>

1725
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:14.240
<v Speaker 5>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really liked Naomi Wolf.</v>

1726
01:26:14.241 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what she says really makes sense to me.</v>

1727
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Like there was conversations about stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way that felt different and </v>

1728
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:25.690
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's sort of this rigidity now with </v>

1729
01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 5>people snapping to both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>equation.</v>

1730
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:28.920
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the things that I,</v>

1731
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:34.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in our courses that I liked a lot was </v>

1732
01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.241
<v Speaker 5>that if somebody raised something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was clearly just some ideologically </v>

1733
01:26:37.241 --> 01:26:42.101
<v Speaker 5>based,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what I'm supposed to be saying </v>

1734
01:26:42.101 --> 01:26:42.101
<v Speaker 5>and reiterating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't have any tolerance for us.</v>

1735
01:26:42.101 --> 01:26:44.120
<v Speaker 5>And I always respected that because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

1736
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:47.030
<v Speaker 5>and it also wasn't from a perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 5>being shut down to it.</v>

1737
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love eating conversation that you want</v>

1738
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:54.041
<v Speaker 5>to have on the merits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to engage in a </v>

1739
01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:55.640
<v Speaker 5>conversation with a false bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>scaffolding that you're inhabiting.</v>

1740
01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.510
<v Speaker 5>It was sort of the vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was interesting.</v>

1741
01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I written there.</v>

1742
01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I remember was,</v>

1743
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:09.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you remember this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in one of my personality </v>

1744
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:13.171
<v Speaker 2>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had asked the questions for a scale </v>

1745
01:27:13.171 --> 01:27:16.591
<v Speaker 2>called the sensation seeking scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was what of the early versions of </v>

1746
01:27:16.591 --> 01:27:20.911
<v Speaker 2>a big five variant and to sensation </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeking scale asks people in park about </v>

1747
01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:26.170
<v Speaker 2>minor juvenile rule breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think shoplifting might've been one of</v>

1748
01:27:26.171 --> 01:27:31.171
<v Speaker 2>the many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I asked everyone questions and I </v>

1749
01:27:31.171 --> 01:27:34.321
<v Speaker 2>had them score it and then I asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to put up their hands at each </v>

1750
01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:39.900
<v Speaker 2>level of increase in scores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you in the bottom 10th </v>

1751
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.100
<v Speaker 2>percentile percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10th percentile or whatever.</v>

1752
01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the only person who put up his </v>

1753
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.460
<v Speaker 2>hand in the highest of the categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I also remember correctly,</v>

1754
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I laughed about that quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if I also remembered correctly,</v>

1755
01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you got a date out of that.</v>

1756
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:03.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody asked me who is either like the</v>

1757
01:28:03.221 --> 01:28:08.221
<v Speaker 5>top percentile in sensation seeking or </v>
<v Speaker 5>where will surgeon it was going to be </v>

1758
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.000
<v Speaker 5>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I pretty much hit it,</v>

1759
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.100
<v Speaker 5>but we should also keep in mind that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this was at Harvard.</v>

1760
01:28:13.101 --> 01:28:17.310
<v Speaker 5>And so like the skills for like crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensation seeking daredevils,</v>

1761
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1762
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.930
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised about when I,</v>

1763
01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.980
<v Speaker 2>when I administered that scale to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole class was just how low the overall</v>

1764
01:28:25.981 --> 01:28:30.981
<v Speaker 2>scores were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that conscientiousness is a </v>

1765
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:32.190
<v Speaker 2>really good predictor of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of academic performance.</v>

1766
01:28:32.191 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:28:34.981 --> 01:28:39.150
<v Speaker 2>the kids there tended towards hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious miss more than towards say</v>

1768
01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.570
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entrepreneurial sort of thing.</v>

1769
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:47.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you want the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're talking about this from the </v>

1770
01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:48.650
<v Speaker 5>big five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like obviously conscientiousness,</v>

1771
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:51.430
<v Speaker 5>better predictor in some ways than Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1772
01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:56.580
<v Speaker 5>On the street scale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like if you can have the talent</v>

1773
01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Speaker 5>and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where you see people killing it </v>

1774
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Speaker 5>in like three or four</v>

1775
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.870
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like that's just a win.</v>

1776
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1777
01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rare to have that entrepreneurial </v>

1778
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.460
<v Speaker 2>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative ability and also to ally that </v>

1779
01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.310
<v Speaker 2>with say industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of conscientiousness.</v>

1780
01:29:14.311 --> 01:29:19.311
<v Speaker 2>And it's rough too because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness part of conscientiousness </v>

1781
01:29:19.311 --> 01:29:21.430
<v Speaker 2>scenes to constrain creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a real big mean.</v>

1782
01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1783
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:28.131
<v Speaker 2>is that on the political continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that that runs from,</v>

1784
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Speaker 2>from left liberal to conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1785
01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:36.411
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives are high in </v>

1786
01:29:36.411 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and low and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity,</v>

1787
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but mostly what they're high end these </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>

1788
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Whereas liberals are high in openness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and low in orderliness.</v>

1789
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the things that comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's really interesting is that </v>

1790
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking a lot about lately is</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to figure out why </v>

1791
01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and openness aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated,</v>

1792
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:59.721
<v Speaker 2>so there's no real reason for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lay together to predict political </v>

1793
01:29:59.721 --> 01:29:59.721
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

1794
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:05.150
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that struck me </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard and I think trump's </v>

1795
01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.571
<v Speaker 2>discussion of the wall between the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mexico really got this active in my </v>

1796
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:12.591
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that as well as all this stuff I've </v>

1797
01:30:12.591 --> 01:30:14.010
<v Speaker 2>been involved in recently with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you can say and what you can say</v>

1798
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of political correctness,</v>

1799
01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:22.051
<v Speaker 2>is that I think the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>political question boils down to whether</v>

1800
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:26.340
<v Speaker 2>borders should be opened or closed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>high orderly,</v>

1801
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 2>low creative people like everything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in boxes and they don't get much of a</v>

1802
01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:35.541
<v Speaker 2>kick out of the potential creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>interplay that can come from loosening </v>

1803
01:30:35.541 --> 01:30:40.521
<v Speaker 2>the borders between things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're also willing to subject </v>

1804
01:30:40.521 --> 01:30:44.901
<v Speaker 2>themselves to the discipline of order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the things that gives </v>

1805
01:30:44.901 --> 01:30:48.681
<v Speaker 2>them an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other side of the spectrum </v>

1806
01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:48.681
<v Speaker 2>with them</v>

1807
01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:48.681
<v Speaker 4>willing.</v>

1808
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

1809
01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:53.370
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't think that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1810
01:30:53.371 --> 01:30:54.810
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a wall.</v>

1811
01:30:54.811 --> 01:30:58.800
<v Speaker 2>I better turn around to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we could put a ladder over it.</v>

1812
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:59.910
<v Speaker 2>How would that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or.</v>

1813
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1814
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.600
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>

1815
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 4>The underground.</v>

1816
01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1817
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.800
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1818
01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:12.090
<v Speaker 2>and so the liberal types they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to uh,</v>

1819
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.600
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of the possibilities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are set forth by breaking the borders </v>

1820
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.670
<v Speaker 2>between things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also unwilling to accept the</v>

1821
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>discipline that working within an </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderly structure will,</v>

1822
01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.640
<v Speaker 2>will provide anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the border issue is pervasive at</v>

1823
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:34.161
<v Speaker 2>every level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the conservative types like the </v>

1824
01:31:34.161 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 2>borders around everything to remain </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight,</v>

1825
01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.080
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

1826
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>nationality that the state itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the more</v>

1827
01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:46.760
<v Speaker 4>conventionally right now with trump and </v>
<v Speaker 4>advocate,</v>

1828
01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.490
<v Speaker 4>but conventionally conservatives are </v>
<v Speaker 4>returned even though Clinton cooperative</v>

1829
01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.190
<v Speaker 4>with like when it comes to money,</v>

1830
01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:58.900
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like only rules around </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximizing money because free trade,</v>

1831
01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1832
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:05.070
<v Speaker 2>know that it's a funny one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you never get a pure </v>

1833
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:07.711
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean conservatives can be </v>

1834
01:32:07.711 --> 01:32:07.711
<v Speaker 2>protectionists too at times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1835
01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:12.780
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the political expression </v>

1836
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.321
<v Speaker 2>depends to some degree on what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in the environment at that </v>

1837
01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:16.321
<v Speaker 2>particular point.</v>

1838
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 5>But Surf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>surfing all these walls is like.</v>

1839
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the trick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1840
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 5>It's so much easier to armor yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>and one pure ideology.</v>

1841
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:26.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I think about a lot is</v>

1842
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 5>with the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've just gotten back from a two week</v>

1843
01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:34.370
<v Speaker 5>for a two week leg of the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a different city every day and </v>

1844
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:35.420
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's reviews and it's readers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's all the stuff.</v>

1845
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:40.430
<v Speaker 5>And I've been thinking a lot about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much work it takes to,</v>

1846
01:32:40.781 --> 01:32:44.950
<v Speaker 5>not to stay open creatively but stay </v>
<v Speaker 5>focused enough.</v>

1847
01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty high in orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's something that,</v>

1848
01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1849
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can interfere.</v>

1850
01:32:49.751 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 5>But it's weird because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1851
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:52.930
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like to be a writer,</v>

1852
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:57.931
<v Speaker 5>you sort of need the sensitivity of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>butterfly with the hide of a rhinoceros.</v>

1853
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:03.960
<v Speaker 5>Like you need to be so sensitive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>attuned to things and also so willing to</v>

1854
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 5>accept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1855
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:11.251
<v Speaker 5>rejection or negative reviews are all </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of weird feedback and everything </v>

1856
01:33:11.251 --> 01:33:14.941
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm saying this from someone who's </v>

1857
01:33:14.941 --> 01:33:14.941
<v Speaker 5>been fortunate enough to be largely </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

1858
01:33:14.941 --> 01:33:15.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

1859
01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:20.730
<v Speaker 5>there's a battering that you take when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you try and advance something outside </v>

1860
01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:25.081
<v Speaker 5>the normal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're starting to sound like </v>

1861
01:33:25.081 --> 01:33:25.081
<v Speaker 5>Madonna.</v>

1862
01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually watched that speech she made </v>

1863
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.340
<v Speaker 2>the other day and I think she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed actually.</v>

1864
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 2>What was the speech?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I say that sounded like Madonna</v>

1865
01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.500
<v Speaker 2>oven of the year award or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1866
01:33:37.501 --> 01:33:42.501
<v Speaker 2>I happened to watch a version of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she was intercut with Milo </v>

1867
01:33:42.501 --> 01:33:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was actually quite comical.</v>

1868
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:49.340
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she spent a lot of time complaining </v>

1869
01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.860
<v Speaker 2>about how hard it was to be Madonna and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a woman.</v>

1870
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was watching it very carefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she,</v>

1871
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.660
<v Speaker 2>she didn't say one positive thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>her life and I thought and she seemed to</v>

1872
01:33:57.661 --> 01:34:01.350
<v Speaker 2>be close to tears most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought there's something wrong.</v>

1873
01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:06.630
<v Speaker 2>She looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looked at me like she was actually </v>

1874
01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:06.630
<v Speaker 2>depressed because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1875
01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's had a pretty successful go of it.</v>

1876
01:34:07.831 --> 01:34:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And to only focus on the negative is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1877
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:12.030
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of rough,</v>

1878
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:12.960
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1879
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 5>but neither of those things are bad that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1880
01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:21.700
<v Speaker 5>that I'm pointing to meaning like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to be as sensitive as possible so </v>

1881
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.441
<v Speaker 5>that you're attuned to constant kept </v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole butterfly Rhinoceros Eminence</v>

1882
01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 5>image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1883
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:34.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can see what I mean is there's a,</v>

1884
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:39.310
<v Speaker 5>there's a trick to trying to be floating</v>
<v Speaker 5>to maintain all your openness and also </v>

1885
01:34:40.461 --> 01:34:45.461
<v Speaker 5>be tough as hell like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of one of the ways to do it </v>

1886
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:46.700
<v Speaker 5>because you need to blaze forward with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1887
01:34:46.730 --> 01:34:50.670
<v Speaker 5>with it like butterfly Rhinoceros </v>
<v Speaker 5>blazing forward.</v>

1888
01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:51.340
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1889
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.470
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:56.930
<v Speaker 5>As,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the common refrain is socrates said,</v>

1891
01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.800
<v Speaker 5>a butterfly sting like a rhinoceros,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you're breaking away from those</v>

1892
01:35:08.811 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 5>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those structures,</v>

1893
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:12.260
<v Speaker 5>when you're in a space that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>entrepreneurial,</v>

1894
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:13.700
<v Speaker 5>that's the chow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1895
01:35:13.701 --> 01:35:18.701
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's part of the challenge that we're </v>

1896
01:35:18.701 --> 01:35:18.701
<v Speaker 5>seeing people not resisting with group </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1897
01:35:18.701 --> 01:35:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Like there's such a need to apparel and </v>
<v Speaker 5>armor yourself in inset ideologies,</v>

1898
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:28.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1899
01:35:28.111 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 5>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have things be a certain way,</v>

1900
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.180
<v Speaker 5>to just go all the way off on </v>
<v Speaker 5>orderliness.</v>

1901
01:35:32.181 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 5>But to try and maintain high discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I orderliness and high opendesk the.</v>

1902
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a constant tension that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>moving.</v>

1903
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1904
01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1905
01:35:40.241 --> 01:35:45.241
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's partly why high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level creative performances so rare is </v>

1906
01:35:45.241 --> 01:35:49.651
<v Speaker 2>because it's very difficult to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things together because they </v>

1907
01:35:49.651 --> 01:35:49.750
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mutually constraining.</v>

1908
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's interesting.</v>

1909
01:35:51.781 --> 01:35:56.781
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've worked with a lot of celebrities </v>

1910
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:58.380
<v Speaker 5>who are at a fairly high level in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest level,</v>

1911
01:35:58.381 --> 01:36:03.381
<v Speaker 5>let's just say whether it's acting or </v>
<v Speaker 5>singing or household name people who,</v>

1912
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.920
<v Speaker 5>some of whom carry with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The press reputation of being smart and </v>

1913
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.361
<v Speaker 5>some who do not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that always amazes me is </v>

1914
01:36:14.361 --> 01:36:17.601
<v Speaker 5>like anyone at a certain level of fame,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how has the level of unbelievable.</v>

1915
01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:25.341
<v Speaker 5>I'm sharpness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's no one who accidentally </v>

1916
01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:29.631
<v Speaker 5>stumbled their way all the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 5>having a top 10 hit or a number one </v>

1917
01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:30.510
<v Speaker 5>movie or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>

1918
01:36:30.511 --> 01:36:35.511
<v Speaker 5>very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so even people that we look at and </v>

1919
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:35.511
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's some stupid celebrity.</v>

1920
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:37.410
<v Speaker 5>That's a dumb actor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an idiot singer.</v>

1921
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.420
<v Speaker 5>People are running empires,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1922
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 5>And they somehow have to do that while </v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping their antenna up and focused </v>

1923
01:36:44.851 --> 01:36:49.851
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and letting enough end to keep creating </v>

1924
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:50.460
<v Speaker 5>in a way that's meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1925
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:51.270
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1926
01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:56.330
<v Speaker 5>I've yet to meet someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people who are a pain </v>

1927
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:58.821
<v Speaker 5>in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've yet to meet people at that </v>

1928
01:36:58.821 --> 01:36:58.821
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not impressed.</v>

1929
01:36:58.821 --> 01:37:02.500
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've learned in recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>years is to go watch famous people when </v>

1930
01:37:02.811 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 2>they come to Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter whether or not I like the.</v>

1931
01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and saw Dolly Parton with my wife</v>

1932
01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:13.340
<v Speaker 2>about six months ago outside at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphitheater.</v>

1933
01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:18.341
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm a great fan of Dolly </v>

1934
01:37:18.341 --> 01:37:18.341
<v Speaker 2>Parton's music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1935
01:37:18.341 --> 01:37:19.460
<v Speaker 2>she's quite the phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1936
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 2>but she was absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely amazing,</v>

1937
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>witty,</v>

1938
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.820
<v Speaker 2>self denigrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a incredibly musically talented,</v>

1939
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 2>a really engaging with the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She really seemed to like to be there.</v>

1940
01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It was a real treat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1941
01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:38.150
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's a rare person who,</v>

1942
01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.180
<v Speaker 2>especially who manages to sustain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>across any amount of time who doesn't </v>

1943
01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.810
<v Speaker 2>have something truly remarkable about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1944
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.960
<v Speaker 5>I'd also like to point out my </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnanimity of not taking the open </v>

1945
01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.750
<v Speaker 5>revenge shot through your Madonna </v>
<v Speaker 5>comment about you go into a Dolly Parton</v>

1946
01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:54.940
<v Speaker 5>concert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want,</v>

1947
01:37:55.470 --> 01:38:00.470
<v Speaker 5>I just want that knowledge and let the </v>
<v Speaker 5>record show that I'm showing enormous </v>

1948
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 5>restricted at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you have the entire discussing.</v>

1949
01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very happy about that too,</v>

1950
01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Have a movie coming out in June.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to talk a little bit about </v>

1952
01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the book of Henry.</v>

1953
01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it stars Naomi Watts.</v>

1954
01:38:18.891 --> 01:38:21.500
<v Speaker 5>We are Jacob Tremblay in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the boy from room.</v>

1955
01:38:21.501 --> 01:38:23.180
<v Speaker 5>Sarah Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who we mentioned earlier.</v>

1956
01:38:23.181 --> 01:38:25.430
<v Speaker 5>Dean Norris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrific cast.</v>

1957
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm Maddie Ziegler who is amazing gate </v>
<v Speaker 5>and leaving hers,</v>

1958
01:38:29.331 --> 01:38:34.331
<v Speaker 5>the boy from St Vincent and midnight </v>
<v Speaker 5>special and it's about I'm constraint </v>

1959
01:38:35.241 --> 01:38:37.280
<v Speaker 5>because we have a very kind of under </v>
<v Speaker 5>wraps.</v>

1960
01:38:37.281 --> 01:38:40.280
<v Speaker 5>We want it to be a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very unusual,</v>

1961
01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:41.990
<v Speaker 5>very special kind of film.</v>

1962
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:46.250
<v Speaker 5>I wrote the rough draft of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first draft 18 years ago.</v>

1963
01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:51.340
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this script has literally grown up with </v>

1964
01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:51.340
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1965
01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1966
01:38:51.970 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 5>it's about a single mom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naomi Watts plays the character who is </v>

1967
01:38:56.970 --> 01:39:01.091
<v Speaker 5>raising two boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of whom is a prodigy and something </v>

1968
01:39:01.091 --> 01:39:04.031
<v Speaker 5>very bad is happening next door to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and working with her son who was a </v>

1969
01:39:04.551 --> 01:39:09.551
<v Speaker 5>prodigy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she has to figure out she's a lot like </v>

1970
01:39:09.551 --> 01:39:11.831
<v Speaker 5>the child in the relationship and the 12</v>
<v Speaker 5>year old is more like the adults and </v>

1971
01:39:11.831 --> 01:39:13.550
<v Speaker 5>they have to sort of navigate through </v>
<v Speaker 5>their way to a solution.</v>

1972
01:39:13.551 --> 01:39:17.540
<v Speaker 5>It has a very strong thriller elements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has some humor.</v>

1973
01:39:17.541 --> 01:39:22.541
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I said I was thinking </v>

1974
01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:26.321
<v Speaker 5>about is that I hope there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions in it that will catch people </v>

1975
01:39:26.321 --> 01:39:26.321
<v Speaker 5>off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1976
01:39:26.321 --> 01:39:31.120
<v Speaker 5>and how it got made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why it took so long to get made is it </v>

1977
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:31.120
<v Speaker 5>was so unusual.</v>

1978
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.150
<v Speaker 5>How it got made was I found a director,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm off a movie called safety,</v>

1979
01:39:34.551 --> 01:39:39.551
<v Speaker 5>not guaranteed that it's a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>little small independent movie called </v>

1980
01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Colin trevorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we were moving forward toward </v>

1981
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:45.040
<v Speaker 5>production.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he said,</v>

1982
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:45.770
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just had a meeting with Spielberg.</v>

1983
01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.800
<v Speaker 5>There's no conceivable way he would give</v>
<v Speaker 5>me Jurassic world off my tiny little </v>

1984
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.040
<v Speaker 5>movie that costs probably less than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>catering budget for Jurassic world,</v>

1985
01:39:55.250 --> 01:40:00.250
<v Speaker 5>but I just want to give you a heads up </v>
<v Speaker 5>on two weeks later he called and was </v>

1986
01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:00.250
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1987
01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:02.750
<v Speaker 5>I got dress mortal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I lost him and he said to me,</v>

1988
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:04.770
<v Speaker 5>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that will reveal,</v>

1989
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make all this money,</v>

1990
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:08.790
<v Speaker 5>we can just come back and get this </v>
<v Speaker 5>screen less.</v>

1991
01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so he went off and made it,</v>

1992
01:40:10.930 --> 01:40:13.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I think one point $7,000,000,000</v>

1993
01:40:13.581 --> 01:40:16.250
<v Speaker 5>for universal and true to his word.</v>

1994
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:20.180
<v Speaker 5>And I have enormous regard for calling </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a variety of reasons,</v>

1995
01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:21.950
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this being one of them,</v>

1996
01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he came back and called me and said,</v>

1997
01:40:24.171 --> 01:40:29.171
<v Speaker 5>well now I'm doing one of the next star </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars movies and I have a window and </v>

1998
01:40:29.171 --> 01:40:32.330
<v Speaker 5>let's shoot this thing and go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we had the small window.</v>

1999
01:40:32.331 --> 01:40:37.331
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the rewrite in like four or five </v>

2000
01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:37.331
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the production or garage.</v>

2001
01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:37.910
<v Speaker 5>And we just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he casts it like that.</v>

2002
01:40:37.911 --> 01:40:42.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that point he was someone who </v>

2003
01:40:42.911 --> 01:40:42.980
<v Speaker 5>everyone wanted to work with and off we </v>
<v Speaker 5>went and it was amazing.</v>

2004
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.640
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2005
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:46.310
<v Speaker 5>18 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an overnight success.</v>

2006
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:48.700
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2007
01:40:50.170 --> 01:40:51.170
<v Speaker 5>that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

2008
01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 5>We should probably call it quits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's been about 90 minutes,</v>

2009
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be about the right amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time,</v>

2010
01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 2>so thanks very much for talking with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2011
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 2>well we'll talk soon and we'll see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes as a youtube video and as a </v>

2012
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:06.700
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you'll be the first one up on</v>

2013
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:11.750
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hopefully do a number of </v>

2014
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:14.610
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed a Canadian composer </v>

2015
01:41:14.801 --> 01:41:19.801
<v Speaker 2>yesterday for 90 minutes as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that one's going to take a </v>

2016
01:41:19.801 --> 01:41:20.170
<v Speaker 2>little time to get the audio editing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2017
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So you might be the first one out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so obviously I'll let you know as soon </v>

2018
01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:29.431
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
