1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I've really been trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underlying psychology of </v>

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.721
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism and its relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxism and then the spread of that </v>

4
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:30.841
<v Speaker 2>into the universities and the effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture and what I would like to </v>

5
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 2>start with is a description of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of that because our,</v>

6
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>like I've presented to the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are listening to me,</v>

7
00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:41.101
<v Speaker 2>my understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed Steven Hicks recently and </v>

8
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 2>he wrote an interesting book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining postmodernism,</v>

9
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 2>which I liked quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been criticized for being too right</v>

10
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:50.521
<v Speaker 2>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't think he's right wing </v>

11
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.351
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe you could characterize </v>

12
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>them as middle of the road conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he's more like a classic</v>

13
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:59.041
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm really curious about your views </v>

14
00:00:59.041 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 2>about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>what postmodernism is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I know you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've identified it with the,</v>

17
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>with the general tricksters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duroda and Latina and Sukkot and </v>

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>football in particular you've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

19
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:15.241
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to know what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about postmodernism and also why you </v>

20
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 2>think it's been so attractive to people.</v>

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my explanation is that there is no </v>

22
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.041
<v Speaker 3>authentic 19 sixties point of view in </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the elite universities.</v>

23
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But rather,</v>

24
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 3>the most liberated minds of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation were 1960.</v>

25
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It did not go onto graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I witnessed with my own eyes.</v>

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I saw genuine marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:41.301
<v Speaker 3>At my college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the State University of New </v>

28
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:41.301
<v Speaker 3>York at Binghamton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upstate New York,</v>

29
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:46.221
<v Speaker 3>a Harper College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had a huge cohort of very radical </v>

30
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 3>downstate New York Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

32
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 3>the Harper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we used to be called Berkeley East.</v>

33
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 3>So I saw genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>passionate marxists with my own eyes.</v>

34
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 3>They were not word choppers at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were not snide postmodernists,</v>

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't in your face aggressive.</v>

36
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 3>They use the language of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a populist energy.</v>

37
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dressed working class.</v>

38
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 3>There were non materialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

39
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 3>these are people who lived by their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>convictions.</v>

40
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 3>They were against the graduate school.</v>

41
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 3>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

42
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went onto graduate school and it became </v>

43
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.351
<v Speaker 3>known that I was going to go to Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was confronted by a leader of the </v>

44
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.951
<v Speaker 3>radicals on campus or in broad daylight </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of everyone who denounced me </v>

45
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 3>for Grad school is not where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

46
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do that.</v>

47
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 3>If you have to go to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should go to buffalo now.</v>

48
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:43.431
<v Speaker 3>And I had applied to these students to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suny buffalo because the great leftist </v>

49
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 3>critic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leslie fiedler was there.</v>

50
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 3>What a huge impact on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

51
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 3>He created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created identity politics,</v>

52
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 3>but without its present distortions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

53
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 3>and Norman Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second one,</v>

54
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:57.301
<v Speaker 3>little critic was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will be very happy to have gone onto </v>

55
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:57.301
<v Speaker 3>buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I needed the library again.</v>

56
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 3>So I continued on to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

57
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080
<v Speaker 3>the word no in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the graduate schools from 1968 to 72 </v>

58
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 3>when I was there were only one radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>todd Gitlin.</v>

59
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went on to have a career success.</v>

60
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actual radicals of the 19 sixties,</v>

61
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either when off dropped out of college </v>

62
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 3>and went off to create commune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I or they were taking acid and </v>

63
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 3>destroyed their brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have also written about that,</v>

64
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 3>the destruction of the of the minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

65
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll for the most talented members of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation through Lsd,</v>

66
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:34.321
<v Speaker 3>it was going on all around me towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened is the actual legacy of </v>

67
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.911
<v Speaker 3>the sixties got truncated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that these poststructuralist </v>

68
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.281
<v Speaker 3>and postmodernist are heirs of the 1960 </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] revolution is an absolute </v>

69
00:03:43.281 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 3>crock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

70
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>What they represent as Fuko shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows Fuko said,</v>

71
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest influence on on his thinking</v>

72
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 3>was Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

73
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Which was a post World War Two play </v>
<v Speaker 3>written in Paris.</v>

74
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:03.301
<v Speaker 3>That was about the disillusionment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism experienced after Hitler went </v>

75
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 3>through occupied France and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe was in ruins and had nothing to </v>

76
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

77
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Waiting for Godot has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the authentic legacy of the 19 sixties,</v>

78
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 3>which was about genuine </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiculturalism,</v>

79
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.690
<v Speaker 3>a movement toward India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hinduism.</v>

80
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I a transformation of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>through psychedelics,</v>

81
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 3>which I take but which identify with </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally through the music,</v>

82
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

83
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It was a turn toward the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a tuRn towards sensory </v>

84
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

85
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this word shopping thing and this </v>

86
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 3>cynical removal from an actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that french import.</v>

87
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Came in.</v>

88
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the graduate school,</v>

89
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 3>it did not affect any genuine 19 sixties</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

90
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 3>The real 19 sixties revolution was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>

91
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 3>It was about a way of seeing the cosmos </v>
<v Speaker 3>in mythological terms and the union </v>

92
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 3>contribution went on into the new age </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement of the 19 seventies.</v>

93
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Aside from the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who took over the universities were </v>

94
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 3>these careerists hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw them with my own eyes.</v>

95
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I saw what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was at yale when derrida was</v>

96
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 3>being shipped over to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to address the,</v>

97
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the student is around students and the </v>

99
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.431
<v Speaker 3>faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said to a fellow student after </v>

100
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 3>hearing one of these guys speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't dairy die.</v>

101
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't another one of the theorists.</v>

102
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are like high priests murmuring to </v>

103
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

104
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 3>this was an elitist form from the start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

105
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 3>It was not progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not revolutionary.</v>

106
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 3>It was reactionary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a desperate attempt to hold on to</v>

107
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:45.811
<v Speaker 3>what had happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 19 sixties sensory revolution was </v>

108
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:46.490
<v Speaker 3>this postmodernist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

109
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 3>This trashing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

110
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Of of the text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this,</v>

111
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 3>this encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

112
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:57.811
<v Speaker 3>Have a superior and destructive attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>toward the work of art that we're going </v>

113
00:05:57.811 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

114
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Primly with red pen in hand.</v>

115
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Finding all the evidence of sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check racism,</v>

116
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.680
<v Speaker 3>check homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check.</v>

117
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 3>That is not the empathic emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Sensory based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.660
<v Speaker 3>A revolution of the 19 sixties I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am sick and tired of these people </v>

120
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 3>claiming any kind of mental from the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

121
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 3>They're frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are.</v>

122
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.890
<v Speaker 3>What happened in the 19 seventies was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse of the job market in academia.</v>

123
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden those jobs were scarce </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this thing was there.</v>

124
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:32.100
<v Speaker 3>The new and improved and shiny thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a fearless.</v>

125
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.300
<v Speaker 3>People seized on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was institutionalized and it's an </v>

126
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 3>enormous betrayal of the 1960 </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

127
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You touched on this idea of the </v>

128
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 2>destruction of the work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

129
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.881
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about reading nature was his discussion </v>

130
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:49.800
<v Speaker 2>of resolved them all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of resentment and,</v>

131
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of the motive power that drives </v>

132
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it,</v>

133
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

134
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>transformation seems to me to be driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>by resentment about virtually anything </v>

135
00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:06.090
<v Speaker 2>that has any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

136
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any merIt of competence or aesthetic </v>

137
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:11.340
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that's,</v>

138
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that that's partly rooted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the academics.</v>

139
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:19.791
<v Speaker 2>Disdain for the business world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is driven by their </v>

140
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:23.211
<v Speaker 2>relative economic inequality because </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people who are as intelligent as </v>

141
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:27.501
<v Speaker 2>academics are from a pure iq point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view make more money in the private </v>

142
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:28.590
<v Speaker 2>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that drives some of it.</v>

143
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but there also seems to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a destruction on aim for </v>

144
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 2>destruction of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the aesthetic quality of the,</v>

145
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 2>of the literary or artistic work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's reduction to nothing but some kind </v>

146
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.500
<v Speaker 2>of power game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then surrounding that,</v>

147
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:46.980
<v Speaker 2>the reduction of everything to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that approximates a power gate,</v>

148
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can't help but identifying with </v>

149
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>jealousy and resentment as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fundamental motivator.</v>

150
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem reasonable to you?</v>

151
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Professors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

152
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Who allege at art is nothing but an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological movement by one elite,</v>

153
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 3>a against the against another group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

154
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 3>These people are philistines the </v>
<v Speaker 3>philistines.</v>

155
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 3>They're middlebrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopelessly middlebrow,</v>

156
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 3>or they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no sense of beauty.</v>

157
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 3>They have no sense of the aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

158
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:22.541
<v Speaker 3>marxism doesn't need a search.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This moccasin tries to reconfigure the </v>

159
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:27.641
<v Speaker 3>universe in terms of materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says it does not recognize any kind </v>

160
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 3>of spiritual dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm an atheist,</v>

161
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 3>but I see the great world religions as </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous works of art as the,</v>

162
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:40.841
<v Speaker 3>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the best way to understand the </v>

163
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.061
<v Speaker 3>universe and man's place in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find them enOrmously moving that </v>

164
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:43.870
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like enormous pole,</v>

165
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 3>and I and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have called for the true revolution.</v>

166
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would have been okay to make the core </v>

167
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.170
<v Speaker 3>currIculum of world education the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

168
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.390
<v Speaker 3>The great religions of the world feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the only way to achieve an </v>

169
00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 3>understanding and it's also a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

170
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 3>to present the aesthetic.</v>

171
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel that,</v>

172
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.300
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the real sixties' vision was about </v>

173
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:07.300
<v Speaker 3>xcel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taishan,</v>

174
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.130
<v Speaker 3>elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmic consciousness.</v>

175
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things were rejected.</v>

176
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By these,</v>

177
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 3>by these midgets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

178
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Intellectual midgets who seized onto </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecan,</v>

179
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 3>derrida and fuko.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

180
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 3>It's an and my career has been in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>art school.</v>

181
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 3>So I made my entire career beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything college.</v>

182
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

183
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I represent a challenge to this from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of art.</v>

184
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>It is an absolute nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

185
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 3>As post structuralism maintains that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality is mediated by language,</v>

186
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 3>by words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that we can know,</v>

187
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.140
<v Speaker 3>including gender is absolutely madness </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm,</v>

188
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm teaching students whose majors are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ceramics.</v>

189
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our dance.</v>

190
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are jazz musicians who understand </v>

191
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 3>reality in terms of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sensory activation.</v>

192
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.670
<v Speaker 3>So now what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

193
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 3>what happened was something was going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the art world as well.</v>

194
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I identify with andy warhol and pop art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

195
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 3>That was what was going on during my </v>
<v Speaker 3>years in college.</v>

196
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Everything about andy warhol was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

197
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 3>admiration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

198
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 3>What happened immediately after that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the arts?</v>

199
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

200
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Was this collapse into a snide sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism?</v>

201
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:21.411
<v Speaker 3>also?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happened in the art world and it </v>

202
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 3>was an utter misunderstanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

203
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:27.681
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me by that movement in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>art world that is a oppositional art,</v>

204
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 3>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is dead.</v>

205
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been this what?</v>

206
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:36.411
<v Speaker 3>Postmodernism is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it pathetic attempt to continue </v>

207
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 3>the old hero as some of the avant garde?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The avant garde was genuinely heroic </v>

208
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 3>from the early 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

209
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about,</v>

210
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the core bay,</v>

211
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 3>the realist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about monet and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>impression is people who are genuinely </v>

213
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 3>suffered for their radical ideas and new</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovations and so on.</v>

214
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I going right down to dirt to picasso </v>
<v Speaker 3>and down to a to jackson pollack who </v>

215
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who truly suffered for his art.</v>

216
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 3>It was only after his death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

217
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:03.750
<v Speaker 3>That suddenly the market was created for</v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract art.</v>

218
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Pop art killed the avant garde.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the avant garde continues.</v>

219
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolute delusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>contemporary art world now,</v>

220
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>which feels that it must attack attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

221
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

222
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

223
00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:17.420
<v Speaker 3>the simplistic belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the toy poodle.</v>

224
00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's somehow the arctic.</v>

225
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

226
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

227
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 3>From the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

228
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:27.201
<v Speaker 3>Andy warhol went through and embraced of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the popular media in britain instead of </v>

229
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 3>having the opposition to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the serious artists have had.</v>

230
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That was the end of oppositional art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

231
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 3>so we had been going on now for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

232
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 3>The postmodernism in academe is hand in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand with the stupidity and infantilism </v>

233
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 3>that masquerades as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as as important art and galleries </v>

234
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

235
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 3>This incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>

236
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mechanism oF contemporary art to </v>

237
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.750
<v Speaker 3>pushing things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are so hopelessly derivative that </v>

238
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 3>with this idea that once again that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>art world,</v>

239
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:59.761
<v Speaker 3>some houses a period of view of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the authentic leftism is populist.</v>

240
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is based in working class style,</v>

241
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.560
<v Speaker 3>working class language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working class direct emotion and an </v>

242
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 3>openness and brushing some speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

243
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Not this fanCy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contorted jargon of this pseudo leftists</v>

<v Speaker 3>harvard and princeton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

250
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 3>They know how to manipulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy,</v>

251
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 3>which has totally invaded in usurped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

252
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 3>The year they have an academe </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

253
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are company pl players.</v>

254
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.350
<v Speaker 3>They could have done well in any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any field and then they,</v>

255
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>they love to sit in endless committees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love bureaucratic regulation and so</v>

256
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not one,</v>

257
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 3>not one leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

258
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 3>And american academe raised his or her </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice against obscene growth.</v>

259
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Growth of tuition costs which have </v>
<v Speaker 3>bankrupted a whole generation of young </v>

260
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

261
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 3>not one voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

262
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 3>To challenge that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That invasion by the bureaucrats.</v>

263
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Actual fascist bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

264
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it were for added,</v>

265
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 3>they're like the cancerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

266
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of them because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>faculty have completely lost any power </v>

267
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:12.390
<v Speaker 3>in american academia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

268
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 3>It's us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a scandal.</v>

269
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:19.111
<v Speaker 3>What has happened and they deserve the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president's servitude that they're in </v>

270
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:19.111
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

271
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Because they never protested when I my </v>
<v Speaker 3>first job at bennington college,</v>

272
00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:26.911
<v Speaker 3>1976,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there when there was an uprising </v>

273
00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:29.761
<v Speaker 3>by the faculty against encroachment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the board of trustees and the </v>

274
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:29.761
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

275
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 3>And it was a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

276
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was reported on the New York times </v>

277
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we.</v>

278
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 3>And we pushed that precedent out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

279
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's not been a single uprising </v>

280
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 3>of mankind against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>against encroachment,</v>

281
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 3>by the trustees and by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administrations and all these decades.</v>

282
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pass them slaves.</v>

283
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They deserve their slavery.</v>

284
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

285
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>university professors for a long time is</v>

286
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>that they get exactly what they deserve </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they never stand up and say no.</v>

287
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.930
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite as bad in Canada,</v>

288
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that the students have been</v>

289
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.590
<v Speaker 2>essentially handed a bill of indentured </v>
<v Speaker 2>servitude here for their student loans </v>

290
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.380
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

291
00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:15.381
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the bureaucracy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically conspired to determine how to </v>

292
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:18.210
<v Speaker 2>pick the pockets of the students' future</v>
<v Speaker 2>earnings.</v>

293
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:23.211
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do that by offering them an </v>

294
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:23.310
<v Speaker 2>extended adolescence with no quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

295
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.010
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a real bargain with the devil.</v>

296
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told the abandonment of any kind </v>

297
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 3>of education actually in history and </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

298
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't going along with it.</v>

299
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:36.530
<v Speaker 3>That is the transformation into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cafeteria kind of a menu.</v>

300
00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:41.531
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can pick this course or that course </v>

301
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:43.301
<v Speaker 3>or this course without any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guidance from the university about a </v>

302
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:46.271
<v Speaker 3>central core curriculum that teaches you</v>
<v Speaker 3>history and chronology and introduces </v>

303
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you to the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because our professors are prima donnas.</v>

304
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 3>They can only teach and their little </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

305
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.780
<v Speaker 3>So we have this total fragmentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

306
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

307
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 3>the great art history survey courses are</v>
<v Speaker 3>being abandoned stedelijk because why?</v>

308
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Because graduate students that are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to see the great narratives or </v>

309
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 3>the network because we are taught now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that narratives are fault.</v>

310
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another issue that I'd like to</v>

311
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 2>bring up because one of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot say grote is the alliance between</v>

312
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:17.741
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernists and the neo marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't understand the causal </v>

313
00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>relationship there because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me if you disagree with this.</v>

314
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm a psychologist,</v>

315
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:28.661
<v Speaker 2>not a sociologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm dabbling in things that are </v>

316
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 2>outside of my field of expertise and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some danger in that,</v>

317
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the central postmodernist claim seems to</v>

318
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:37.481
<v Speaker 2>me that because there's a near incident </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of ways to interpret a complex </v>

319
00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:41.681
<v Speaker 2>set of phenomena which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually happens to be the case </v>

320
00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that you can't make a case that any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those modes of interpretation are </v>

321
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.271
<v Speaker 2>canonical and so if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>canonical and if that canonical element </v>

322
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>isn't based in some kind of reality than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it serves some other master.</v>

323
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 2>And so The master that it hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 2>serves for the postmodernists is nothing</v>

324
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 2>but power because that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that they believe it.</v>

325
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in authority.</v>

326
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem to believe in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective world because everything is </v>

327
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.691
<v Speaker 2>language mediated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an extraordinarily cynical </v>

328
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>perspective that that because there's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of interpretations,</v>

329
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:18.611
<v Speaker 2>none of them are canonical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can attribute it to everything to </v>

330
00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:18.611
<v Speaker 2>power and dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

331
00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seemed like a reasonable summary of</v>

332
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 2>the radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a radical relativism now,</v>

333
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 2>but the strange thing is despite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

334
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:31.991
<v Speaker 2>and so what goes along with that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demolition of grand narratives and so </v>

335
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Speaker 2>that would be associated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

336
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 2>with the rejection of thinkers like </v>
<v Speaker 2>young and Eric Norman,</v>

337
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:40.451
<v Speaker 2>because of course their foundational </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers in relationship to the idea </v>

338
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 2>that there are embodied grand narratives</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never touched.</v>

339
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 2>But then despite the fact that the grand</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative is rejected,</v>

340
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a neo marxism that's tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tightly allied with postmodernism.</v>

341
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 2>That also seems to shade into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange identity.</v>

342
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Politics and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two things.</v>

343
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the causal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship there.</v>

344
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Like the skeptical part of me thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that postmodernism was a,</v>

345
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.250
<v Speaker 2>was an intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intellectual camouflage for the </v>

346
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.001
<v Speaker 2>continuation of the kind of pathological</v>
<v Speaker 2>marxism that produced the soviet union </v>

347
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>and that has no independent existence as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intellectual field whatsoever.</v>

348
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.580
<v Speaker 2>But I still can't understand how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists to make the no grand </v>

349
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.471
<v Speaker 2>narrative claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then immerse themselves in this </v>

350
00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>grand narrative without anyone pointing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the evident contradictions.</v>

351
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about that?</v>

352
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only speak about literary and </v>

353
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.080
<v Speaker 3>professors really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they seem to me almost universally </v>

354
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.280
<v Speaker 3>in theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s to being very naive or they,</v>

355
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:43.480
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seemed to know nothing about actual</v>

356
00:17:43.481 --> 00:17:45.930
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political science or economics.</v>

357
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 3>It's simply an attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have an attitude in marxism become </v>

358
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 3>simply a badge by which they telegraph </v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

359
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their solidarity with the working class </v>

360
00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>that they have nothing to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

361
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean they literally nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>contempt.</v>

362
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

363
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is that the campus left us</v>
<v Speaker 3>are almost notorious for their,</v>

364
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their rather snobbish treatment of </v>

365
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.360
<v Speaker 3>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

366
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.121
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any rapport with the </v>

367
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:14.121
<v Speaker 3>actual working class members of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

368
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.920
<v Speaker 3>of the infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the janitorial,</v>

369
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.650
<v Speaker 3>the janitors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even the,</v>

370
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.700
<v Speaker 3>even the secretaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's was kind of high and mighty </v>

371
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.700
<v Speaker 3>aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were just,</v>

373
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.680
<v Speaker 3>these are people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

374
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.780
<v Speaker 3>who have wandered into the english </v>
<v Speaker 3>department and our were products of a </v>

375
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.831
<v Speaker 3>time when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the new criticism they were when </v>

376
00:18:33.831 --> 00:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but history and psychology had been </v>

377
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>excluded.</v>

378
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Me and my ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

379
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

380
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I love the new criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

381
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 3>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a style of textual analysis.</v>

382
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

383
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:48.130
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the new criticism had multiple </v>

384
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.130
<v Speaker 3>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

385
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 3>that were possible and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were encouraged.</v>

386
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.840
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of,</v>

387
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 3>one of the great projects was made in </v>
<v Speaker 3>max series 20th century views,</v>

388
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 3>what you had at least books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I adored them in college.</v>

389
00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 3>And it was about Jane Austin or above </v>
<v Speaker 3>emily bronte or about,</v>

390
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>words worth and they were collections of</v>

391
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:06.620
<v Speaker 3>alternate views of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that no more,</v>

392
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.990
<v Speaker 3>no alternate views and there was no </v>
<v Speaker 3>relativistic situational kinds of,</v>

393
00:19:10.991 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 3>of interpreter approach is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

394
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point was we needed to restore </v>

395
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.490
<v Speaker 3>history to literary literary study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>OkAy.</v>

396
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.270
<v Speaker 3>And we needed to add psychology to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was,</v>

397
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 3>was great animus against freud when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrived in,</v>

398
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 3>in graduate school.</v>

399
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.950
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually went into the director of </v>

400
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Speaker 3>graduate studies and protesting the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>freud and freudian were used as,</v>

401
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 3>as negative terms pay in a sneering way </v>
<v Speaker 3>by that very wasp professors.</v>

402
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:41.110
<v Speaker 3>So we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually it seemed like we were </v>

403
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.491
<v Speaker 3>moving there in the early 19 seventies </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a great period of psycho biography </v>

404
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 3>about great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About political figures.</v>

405
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:50.181
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And So I thought it's happening in all </v>

406
00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:50.760
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden they'd all got short </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuited by this arrival,</v>

407
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:51.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

408
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.470
<v Speaker 3>of post poststructuralism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism in the,</v>

409
00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 seventies.</v>

410
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

411
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:56.990
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

412
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I feel I'm an old historic assist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

413
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Now not a new historical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I think new stores,</v>

414
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.010
<v Speaker 3>so it was an absolute scam and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

415
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like tweezers you'd like just,</v>

416
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you pick a little bit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of that,</v>

417
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:13.731
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of that you make a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny salad and some of this atomized </v>

418
00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:13.731
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

419
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to mean something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all can be very superficial,</v>

420
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>very cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very distance.</v>

421
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.530
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a,</v>

422
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I am the product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

423
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:27.081
<v Speaker 3>of old historicism german philology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decide my first choice of a profession</v>

424
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 3>when I was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was egyptology archeology,</v>

425
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.080
<v Speaker 3>because I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything I ever think about or say is </v>

426
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 3>is related to an enormous time scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

427
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 3>From from antiquity and indeed from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stone age,</v>

428
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 3>and that is the problem with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

429
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:45.290
<v Speaker 3>They're their male educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the postmodernist and academic marxists.</v>

430
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are male educated embarrassingly so.</v>

431
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know nothing before the present for</v>

432
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 3>call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

433
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely a joke before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>

434
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immune.</v>

435
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps he might be useful to people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about what happened at after </v>

436
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 3>neoclassicism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whIch by the way,</v>

437
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 3>he failed to notice a lot of what he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

438
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out to cb simply the hangover of </v>

439
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 3>neoclassicism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

440
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how ignorant that man was.</v>

441
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean his head was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was not talented as a researcher.</v>

442
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.650
<v Speaker 3>He knew absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

443
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know nothing about antiquity.</v>

444
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:20.640
<v Speaker 3>How can you make any kind of large </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

445
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.840
<v Speaker 3>but I'm large mechanism to analyze </v>
<v Speaker 3>western culture without knowing about </v>

446
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>classical antiquity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

447
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:31.741
<v Speaker 3>He did not see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets some person who had no business </v>

448
00:21:31.741 --> 00:21:31.860
<v Speaker 3>making large theoretical statements </v>
<v Speaker 3>about anything.</v>

449
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

450
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe part of it is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you generate an intelligible doctrine</v>

451
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:43.010
<v Speaker 2>of radical relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there is no reason to assume that </v>

452
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.541
<v Speaker 2>there are distinctions between </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories of knowledge or between </v>

453
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:47.541
<v Speaker 2>different levels of quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

454
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:52.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've seen the same thing in the </v>

455
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:53.190
<v Speaker 2>psychology departments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although we have the,</v>

456
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

457
00:21:54.631 --> 00:21:59.631
<v Speaker 2>The luxury of being bounded at least to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree by the empirical method and </v>

458
00:21:59.631 --> 00:21:59.631
<v Speaker 2>by biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

459
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:03.030
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that keeps most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the branches of psychology relatively</v>

460
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.200
<v Speaker 2>sane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.380
<v Speaker 2>because the real world is actually built</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it to some degree.</v>

462
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 2>But If you accept the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim of radical relativism,</v>

463
00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:17.121
<v Speaker 2>then you completely demolished the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are quality levels that are </v>

464
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:18.660
<v Speaker 2>associated with education because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything becomes the same.</v>

465
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to me to be a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable justification for maintaining</v>

466
00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>

467
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like through co.</v>

468
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I actually found him the most readable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the lacan.</v>

469
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.540
<v Speaker 2>There are de fuko triad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can read fuko.</v>

470
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I read mad distance civilization and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of his other books and I thought </v>

471
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.810
<v Speaker 2>they were painfully obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

472
00:22:36.811 --> 00:22:41.811
<v Speaker 2>the idea that mental disorder is in part</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social construct is self evident to </v>

473
00:22:41.811 --> 00:22:44.610
<v Speaker 2>anybody who has even a smattering of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric training.</v>

474
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean the real narrow medical types </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to to think of a mental disorder,</v>

475
00:22:51.061 --> 00:22:53.700
<v Speaker 2>let's say as something that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>purely biological.</v>

476
00:22:53.701 --> 00:22:58.701
<v Speaker 2>They have a peer disease model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's who's a sophIsticated </v>

477
00:22:58.701 --> 00:23:01.911
<v Speaker 2>thinker ever thinks that it's a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because medicine is a brand of </v>

478
00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:06.051
<v Speaker 2>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a brand of science because it's </v>

479
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:08.181
<v Speaker 2>associated with health and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnostic categories are hYbrids </v>

480
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:10.470
<v Speaker 2>between physiological observation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociocultural condition.</v>

481
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that and so when I reaD </v>
<v Speaker 2>madness and civilization,</v>

482
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

483
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just bloody self evident.</v>

484
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that he began,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

485
00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:27.530
<v Speaker 3>the entire turn toward a theological </v>
<v Speaker 3>grounding of modern psychology,</v>

486
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 3>social psychology well launcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 twenties for example.</v>

487
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the levels of ignorance of these.</v>

488
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.520
<v Speaker 3>These people moving foco with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>original have not read durkheim.</v>

489
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.190
<v Speaker 3>They've not read mocks of or they've not</v>
<v Speaker 3>read erving goffman.</v>

490
00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in other words,</v>

491
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:46.420
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for everything is the costing of the </v>

492
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.911
<v Speaker 3>estimate because I had read the from </v>
<v Speaker 3>which he was borrowing without </v>

493
00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:48.911
<v Speaker 3>attribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

494
00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:51.150
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know these people I've met,</v>

495
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:56.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some cases knew them in graduate </v>

496
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:56.160
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who went onto become these,</v>

497
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these admirers of lack on dairy and I </v>

498
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.061
<v Speaker 3>know what their training was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Training was purely within the english </v>

499
00:24:04.061 --> 00:24:04.061
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all they ever knew.</v>

500
00:24:04.061 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 3>they never made it any research outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

501
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the idea for coal is simply this is a</v>

502
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:14.261
<v Speaker 3>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little tiny kit by which </v>

503
00:24:14.261 --> 00:24:14.940
<v Speaker 3>they can approach everything in culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

504
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 3>and then the see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the contortions of language that </v>

505
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.111
<v Speaker 3>deliberate labyrinthine elitists </v>
<v Speaker 3>language at the same time as pretending </v>

506
00:24:22.111 --> 00:24:22.660
<v Speaker 3>to be a leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

507
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the biggest frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>every practice.</v>

508
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:30.150
<v Speaker 2>so I got a story to tell you that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might like because I've thought a lot </v>

509
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.160
<v Speaker 2>about that use of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:33.010
<v Speaker 2>because language can be used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>camouflage.</v>

511
00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got this from robert sapolsky.</v>

512
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
<v Speaker 2>So he was talking about zebras and </v>
<v Speaker 2>zebras of course have stripes and </v>

513
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.140
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>camouflage,</v>

514
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 2>association because zebras are black and</v>

515
00:24:48.281 --> 00:24:50.620
<v Speaker 2>white and they're on the velt along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lions,</v>

516
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>the lions are camouflaged cause their </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass colored.</v>

517
00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 2>But the bloody zebras are black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

518
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.330
<v Speaker 2>You can see them like 15 miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

519
00:24:58.331 --> 00:25:03.331
<v Speaker 2>So biologists go out to study zebras and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like making notes on a zebra and</v>

520
00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:08.641
<v Speaker 2>they watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they look down at their notes and </v>

521
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:08.641
<v Speaker 2>then they look up and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

522
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:08.641
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

523
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Which cbre I was looking at.</v>

524
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.300
<v Speaker 2>So the camouflage is actually against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the herd because the zebras,</v>

525
00:25:13.301 --> 00:25:14.950
<v Speaker 2>a hurt animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an individual.</v>

526
00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:19.951
<v Speaker 2>And so the black and white stripes break</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the animal against the herd so you </v>

527
00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:23.791
<v Speaker 2>can't identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was a quandary for the </v>

528
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:23.791
<v Speaker 2>biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did one of two things.</v>

529
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 2>One was drive a jeep up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the zebra,</v>

530
00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:29.560
<v Speaker 2>heard and use a dab of red paint and dab</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horn.</v>

531
00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Should the zebra or tag it with an ear </v>
<v Speaker 2>tag like used for cattle.</v>

532
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:39.030
<v Speaker 2>The lions would kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as soon as it became identifiable the</v>

533
00:25:39.281 --> 00:25:40.390
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

534
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.000
<v Speaker 2>the predators could organize their hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that.</v>

535
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Identify about animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you know,</v>

536
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:48.640
<v Speaker 2>there's the old idea that lions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators take down the weak animals,</v>

537
00:25:48.641 --> 00:25:51.490
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take down the identifiable animals.</v>

538
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing is if you stick your</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn hand handout,</v>

539
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>you get picked off by predators and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that academics seem to</v>

540
00:25:59.081 --> 00:26:03.010
<v Speaker 2>do is congregate together in heard like </v>
<v Speaker 2>entities and then they share a language,</v>

541
00:26:03.011 --> 00:26:08.011
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the language unites them and also </v>

542
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:11.340
<v Speaker 2>keeps them as long as they share the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same set of linguistic tools among </v>

543
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.420
<v Speaker 2>themselves that they know that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't anybody in the,</v>

544
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.250
<v Speaker 2>in the codery that's going to attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>them or destabilize the entire herd.</v>

545
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.030
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to me to account for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impenetrable use of language.</v>

546
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

547
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.990
<v Speaker 2>it's group protection strategy and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has absolutely nothing to do with the </v>

548
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.950
<v Speaker 2>search for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the search for security within a </v>

549
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.470
<v Speaker 2>system and not the desire to expand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

550
00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not</v>

551
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Speaker 3>federal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but intimate is blatantly careerist </v>

552
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Speaker 3>because they made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

553
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.610
<v Speaker 3>it was about advancement and with also </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the claim that somehow they have </v>

554
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 3>special expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a special technical language.</v>

555
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 3>No one else can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only only weekend,</v>

556
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 3>but what's absurd about it absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>ludicrous that these people,</v>

557
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:53.031
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these american academics are imitating </v>

558
00:26:53.031 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 3>the contorted language of french at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>translations from the french.</v>

559
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that call is translated into,</v>

560
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 3>into english,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

561
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a contortion there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

562
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what he was trying to do in </v>

563
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 3>french was to break up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

564
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 3>The neoclassical formulations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>descended from racine,</v>

565
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:14.301
<v Speaker 3>there was something that was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a sabotage of the french </v>

566
00:27:14.301 --> 00:27:14.301
<v Speaker 3>language going on that was necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 3>France.</v>

567
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily in english.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this long tradition of poetry.</v>

568
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Going back to the shakespeare and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaucer.</v>

569
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have our own language,</v>

570
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 3>but far more vItal than that than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>french.</v>

571
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 3>The french constrain their language all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

572
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:33.430
<v Speaker 3>The absurdity in the amateur is okay of </v>
<v Speaker 3>american academics trying to imitate.</v>

573
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A translation of like hall,</v>

574
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we doing something in France that is </v>

575
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 3>absolutely not necessary and indeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong to be doing in english,</v>

576
00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 3>but the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other cynical abandonment.</v>

577
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have the great tradition of,</v>

578
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.000
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

579
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.630
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the english departments.</v>

580
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.870
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt that the true radicalism was not </v>

581
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 3>about adding on other departments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

582
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 3>So we have african american studies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

583
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:00.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

584
00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:05.111
<v Speaker 3>and women's studies and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The true radicalism would have been to </v>

585
00:28:05.111 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 3>shatter the departmental structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I wanted.</v>

586
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel that was the authentic </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary 19,</v>

587
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 3>67 to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

588
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Don't look to them to blend all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

589
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>study saudis together.</v>

590
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:18.711
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to make easIer to make an </v>

591
00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 3>interdisciplinary kind of organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

592
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 3>closer to the british model where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person can pursue related subjects,</v>

593
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:23.880
<v Speaker 3>overlapping subjects.</v>

594
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.120
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

595
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.880
<v Speaker 3>these departmental models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

596
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

597
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 3>were to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian to begin with.</v>

598
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>separating language into fiefdoms and,</v>

599
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>

600
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 3>what the stitch to create a english </v>
<v Speaker 3>women's studies department.</v>

601
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of the air.</v>

602
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Just snap your fingers and create </v>
<v Speaker 3>women's studies.</v>

603
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 3>The english department had taken a </v>
<v Speaker 3>century to develop.</v>

604
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was.</v>

605
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It was a huge argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

606
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within it.</v>

607
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden to create.</v>

608
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:53.061
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It department where they politicize </v>

609
00:28:53.061 --> 00:28:53.061
<v Speaker 3>agenda from the start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

610
00:28:53.061 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 3>By people without any training </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever in that field.</v>

611
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:59.331
<v Speaker 3>And what should be the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should be the parameters of the </v>

612
00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:01.191
<v Speaker 3>fIeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be the requirements of that </v>

613
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:01.191
<v Speaker 3>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about biology?</v>

614
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:01.191
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be discussing gender,</v>

615
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 3>that should have been a number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement.</v>

616
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:08.091
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>as part of any witness studies </v>

617
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:08.091
<v Speaker 3>department or program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

618
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 3>it was all hands off.</v>

619
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it was just the administrators wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve a public relations problem.</v>

620
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 3>They had a situation with very few women</v>
<v Speaker 3>faculty nationwide at a time when the </v>

621
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.221
<v Speaker 3>women's movement had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just started up that spotlight of </v>

622
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:22.221
<v Speaker 3>attention was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on them.</v>

623
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 3>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they needed women faculty fast.</v>

624
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:26.060
<v Speaker 3>They need to do with the women's subject</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the agenda fast.</v>

625
00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:31.061
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just start let there be women's </v>

626
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:31.061
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

627
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:33.340
<v Speaker 3>And now we'll just hire some women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It usually from english departments,</v>

628
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and there and we'll just throw them</v>

629
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You invent it,</v>

630
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you say what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why women's that has got </v>

631
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 3>frozen at certain point of the ideology </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the early 19 seventies.</v>

632
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I was already in revolt from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

633
00:29:46.711 --> 00:29:51.711
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a precursor in terms of my </v>

634
00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>endorsement of feminists some before it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before even now is created.</v>

635
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I couldn't.</v>

636
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even have a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of these women.</v>

637
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 3>They were hysterical about this subject </v>
<v Speaker 3>of biology.</v>

638
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.470
<v Speaker 3>they knew nothing about hormones and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

639
00:30:01.471 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably got in fist fights over this.</v>

640
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:08.461
<v Speaker 3>They went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were so convinced that biology </v>

641
00:30:08.461 --> 00:30:08.461
<v Speaker 3>had nothing whatsoever to do with gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

642
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 2>That also seems to me to be related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodern emphasis on power because</v>

643
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:19.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something terrible underground </v>

644
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.241
<v Speaker 2>going on there that is an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the sort of thing that </v>

645
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 2>was reflected in the soviet union to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

646
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 2>especially in the twenties when there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was this idea of radical idea that you </v>

647
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 2>could remake human beings entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

648
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Because they have no essential nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if your fundamental hypothesis is</v>

649
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 2>that nothing exists except power and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that,</v>

650
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.810
<v Speaker 2>then that also gives you the right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense to exercise your power at the</v>

651
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 2>creation of the kind of humanity that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your utopian vision envisioned.</v>

652
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Then that has no fat and that also seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me to justify the postmodern </v>

653
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.990
<v Speaker 2>insistence that everything is only a </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic construct.</v>

654
00:30:50.991 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 2>It again gOes down to the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

655
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 2>which dera done food co and luck tower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bloody obsessed with.</v>

656
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me what they're trying </v>

657
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:01.620
<v Speaker 2>to do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

658
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.380
<v Speaker 2>to take all the potential power for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of human beings to themselves </v>

659
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.100
<v Speaker 2>without any bounding conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

660
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 2>RIght?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no history,</v>

661
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 2>there's no biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

662
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything is a fluid culture that </v>

663
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:14.550
<v Speaker 2>can be manipulated at will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>

664
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.620
<v Speaker 2>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are terrible arguments right now </v>

665
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:19.620
<v Speaker 2>about biological essentialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

666
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.240
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was something I objected to </v>

667
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.211
<v Speaker 2>precisely a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the social constructionist view </v>

668
00:31:27.211 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 2>of human identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has been built now into canadian law.</v>

669
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 2>So there's an insistence that biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

670
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.460
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression and sexual proclivity </v>

671
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.320
<v Speaker 2>very independently with no causal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between any of the levels.</v>

672
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 2>And so that's In the law and not only is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in the law,</v>

673
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught in the armed forces,</v>

674
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:51.541
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught in the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being taught to the elementary </v>

675
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 2>school kids and the junior high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and underneath it all,</v>

676
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:57.691
<v Speaker 2>I see this terrible striving for </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary power that's associated with </v>

677
00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:59.420
<v Speaker 2>this crazy utopianism and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

678
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't exactly understand it.</v>

679
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

680
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 2>What seems to be the hatred that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivates it that you see bubbling up,</v>

681
00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:09.640
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in identity politics and,</v>

682
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.740
<v Speaker 2>and in the desire to do nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say demolish the patriarchy.</v>

683
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>It kinda reminds me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something else I wanted to </v>

684
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>talk to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.651
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an admirer of Eric Norman and </v>

686
00:32:22.651 --> 00:32:22.651
<v Speaker 2>have girl young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

687
00:32:22.651 --> 00:32:26.221
<v Speaker 2>And that's the human connection is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting because I think he's </v>

688
00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:29.101
<v Speaker 2>a bloody genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the great mother is a </v>

689
00:32:29.101 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 2>great book and it really a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning.</v>

690
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:34.141
<v Speaker 2>That book and also the orIgins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of consciousness is one of the </v>

691
00:32:34.141 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 2>most influential book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

692
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's so interesting.</v>

693
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I read an essay that you wrote or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't remember</v>

694
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 3>again at</v>

695
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>the nyu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

696
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.380
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been staggering to me that </v>

697
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:46.380
<v Speaker 2>that book hasn't had the impact that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have had.</v>

698
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean young himself in the preface to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that book wrote that that was the book </v>

699
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:50.800
<v Speaker 2>that he wished that he would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>written.</v>

700
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It's very much associated with young </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbols of transformation and it was a </v>

701
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.100
<v Speaker 2>major influence on my book maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

702
00:32:57.101 --> 00:33:02.101
<v Speaker 2>which was an attempt to outline the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal archetypes that are portrayed </v>

703
00:33:02.101 --> 00:33:03.550
<v Speaker 2>in the kind of religious structures that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

704
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.850
<v Speaker 2>that you put forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that I really see </v>

705
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:08.850
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can tell me what you think about</v>

706
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:13.291
<v Speaker 2>this and in norman's book consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is masculine symbolically </v>

707
00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:18.271
<v Speaker 2>masculine for a variety of reasons is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is viewed as rising up against the </v>

708
00:33:19.121 --> 00:33:22.900
<v Speaker 2>countervailing force of tragedy from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying feminine,</v>

709
00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:25.090
<v Speaker 2>symbolically feminine unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

710
00:33:25.091 --> 00:33:30.091
<v Speaker 2>and it's something that can always be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled back into that unconsciousness </v>

711
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 2>that would be the microcosm of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the friday and eatable mother </v>

712
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.750
<v Speaker 2>femineity dynamic where the mother was </v>
<v Speaker 2>so over protective and all encompassing </v>

713
00:33:38.111 --> 00:33:40.510
<v Speaker 2>that she interferes with the development</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the competence,</v>

714
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 2>not only of her sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also of her daughters,</v>

715
00:33:42.611 --> 00:33:43.750
<v Speaker 2>of her children in general.</v>

716
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic that's being played out in our </v>

717
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.250
<v Speaker 2>society right now is that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

718
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:52.720
<v Speaker 2>it's related in some way that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand to this,</v>

719
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.900
<v Speaker 2>to this insistence that all forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine authority or nothing by </v>

720
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.680
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So The symbolic representation is </v>

721
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.300
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical father with no appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the benevolent father and benevolent</v>

722
00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 2>mother with no appreciation whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the tyrannical mother.</v>

723
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that.</v>

724
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 2>And because I thought of videology as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmentary mythologies,</v>

725
00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:17.740
<v Speaker 2>that's where they get their archetype </v>
<v Speaker 2>will in psychological power,</v>

726
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on and balanced representation.</v>

727
00:34:20.081 --> 00:34:23.130
<v Speaker 2>You have the terrible mother and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great mother as,</v>

728
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>as norman laid out so nicely and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the terrible father and the great </v>

729
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the fact that culture mangles </v>

730
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to death well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also promoting you and developing </v>

731
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.351
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to see that as balanced and </v>

732
00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:37.351
<v Speaker 2>then you have the heroic and adversarial</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

733
00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:42.240
<v Speaker 2>But in the postmodern world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this seems to be something that's </v>

734
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.390
<v Speaker 2>increasingly seeping out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture at large,</v>

735
00:34:43.391 --> 00:34:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you have nothing but the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

736
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.820
<v Speaker 2>nothing but the destructive force of </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine consciousness and nothing but </v>

737
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>the benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benevolent great mother and it's an,</v>

738
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:58.650
<v Speaker 2>it's an appalling ideology and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that it's sucking the vitality </v>

739
00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what you would expect </v>

740
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.131
<v Speaker 2>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sucking the vitality of our </v>

741
00:35:05.131 --> 00:35:07.291
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that with the increasing </v>

742
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:07.690
<v Speaker 2>demolition of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of young men,</v>

743
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only young men in terms of their</v>

744
00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:13.150
<v Speaker 2>academic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which like they're falling way behind in</v>

745
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:16.600
<v Speaker 2>elementary school way behind in junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>high and bailing out of the universities</v>

746
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:18.400
<v Speaker 2>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

747
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.200
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

748
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.990
<v Speaker 3>well the public school education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become completely permeated by this</v>

749
00:35:22.991 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 3>kind of anti male propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

750
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 3>and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>public schools,</v>

751
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I just a form of imprisonment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

752
00:35:28.301 --> 00:35:33.301
<v Speaker 3>right now they are particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive to young men who have a lot </v>

753
00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:33.301
<v Speaker 3>of physical energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

754
00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet now I identify as transgender gay </v>

755
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 3>mike myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do not,</v>

756
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I do not require the entire world to </v>
<v Speaker 3>alter itself okay.</v>

757
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 3>To,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fit my particular in the self image.</v>

758
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I do believe in the power of hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that men exist and women </v>

759
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:54.531
<v Speaker 3>exists and are biologically different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I think there is no cure </v>

760
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:59.541
<v Speaker 3>for the cultural ills right now except </v>
<v Speaker 3>if men start standing up and demanding </v>

761
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 3>that they be respected as men again.</v>

762
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I goT a question about that.</v>

763
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things we did a research </v>

764
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 2>project year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out if there was such a</v>

765
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:15.771
<v Speaker 2>thing as political correctness from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric perspective to find out is </v>

766
00:36:15.771 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 2>there the loose aggregation of beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually clumped together statistically.</v>

767
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Speaker 2>And we actually fOund two factors which </v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't go into,</v>

768
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 2>but then we looked at things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted adherence to that,</v>

769
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that a politically correct creed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were a cOuple that were </v>

770
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 2>surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was being female was a predictor,</v>

771
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 2>the personality attributes associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with femininity,</v>

772
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 2>so that would be agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher levels of negative emotion.</v>

773
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:42.651
<v Speaker 2>We're also both independent predictors </v>
<v Speaker 2>but so were symptoms of personality </v>

774
00:36:42.651 --> 00:36:46.521
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really important </v>

775
00:36:46.521 --> 00:36:48.831
<v Speaker 2>because part of what I see happening is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like I think that women whose </v>

776
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 2>relationship with men have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been seriously pathologized,</v>

777
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 2>cannot distinguish between male </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and competence and male </v>

778
00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.591
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they failed to differentiate </v>

779
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:00.591
<v Speaker 2>because all they see is the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>mail.</v>

780
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 2>And then they may have had experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

781
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

782
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 2>their experiences with men might've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>rough enough so that,</v>

783
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:12.711
<v Speaker 2>that differentiation never occurred </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it has to occur and you have to </v>

784
00:37:12.711 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of experience with men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>good men do before that will occur.</v>

785
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.630
<v Speaker 2>BuT it seems to me that we're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly dominated by a view of </v>

786
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.951
<v Speaker 2>masculinity that's mostly characteristic</v>
<v Speaker 2>of women who have terrible personality </v>

787
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 2>disorders and who are unable to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy relationships with men.</v>

788
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem,</v>

789
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something my wife has pointed </v>

790
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.190
<v Speaker 2>out to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

791
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are going to have to stand up for </v>

792
00:37:37.491 --> 00:37:37.491
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>

793
00:37:37.491 --> 00:37:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I know how to stand up to a man who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

794
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfairly trespassed against me.</v>

795
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:47.661
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I know that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the parameters for my resistance are </v>

796
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 2>quite well defined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we talk,</v>

797
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 2>we argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we push,</v>

798
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and then it becomes physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

799
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we move beyond the boundaries of </v>

800
00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 2>civil discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what the next step is.</v>

801
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THat's forbidden in,</v>

802
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.060
<v Speaker 2>in discourse with women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

803
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think that men can </v>
<v Speaker 2>control crazy women.</v>

804
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't believe that.</v>

805
00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that they have to throw their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands up in,</v>

806
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

807
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 2>in what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

808
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 2>in not even disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that the cultural,</v>

809
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.990
<v Speaker 2>there's no step forward that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take under those circumstances because </v>

810
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.080
<v Speaker 2>if the man is offensive enough and crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

811
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 2>the reaction becomes physical right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

812
00:38:24.841 --> 00:38:29.841
<v Speaker 2>Or at least the threat is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when men are talking to each other </v>

813
00:38:29.841 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 2>in any serious manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that underlying thread of physicality is</v>

814
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>always there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's a real conversation,</v>

815
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 2>keeps the things civil arts to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

816
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking to a man who wouldn't </v>

817
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.090
<v Speaker 2>fight with you under any circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

818
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 2>then you're talking to someone to whom </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have absolutely no respect,</v>

819
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see any way.</v>

820
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

821
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:54.331
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman in in toronto who's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing this movement,</v>

822
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:57.340
<v Speaker 2>let's say against me and some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are going to do a free speech</v>

823
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:03.090
<v Speaker 2>event and she managed to organize quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively and she's quite ofensive you</v>

824
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.650
<v Speaker 2>might say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She compared us to nazis,</v>

825
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

826
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly using the swastika,</v>

827
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 2>which wasn't really something I was all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fond of.</v>

828
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:16.470
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm defenseless against that kind of </v>

829
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.411
<v Speaker 2>female insanity because the techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would use against a man who was </v>

830
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 2>employing those tactics are forbidden to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

831
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.360
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems to me that it isn't men </v>

832
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 2>that have to stand up and say enough of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

833
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:32.731
<v Speaker 2>even though that is what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that it's same women who </v>

834
00:39:32.731 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 2>have to stand up against their crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>sisters and say,</v>

835
00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:39.601
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough of that enough man hating enough </v>

836
00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:40.900
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough bringing disgrace on us as a,</v>

837
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.990
<v Speaker 2>as a gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem there and then they'll </v>

838
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Speaker 2>stop my little tirade is that most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the women I know who are saying are busy</v>

839
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 2>doing saying things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all,</v>

840
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 2>they have their career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their family,</v>

841
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:58.411
<v Speaker 2>they're quite occupied and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to have the time or maybe even the </v>

842
00:39:58.411 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 2>interest to go after their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their crazy harpy sisters and so I don't</v>

843
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 2>see any regulating force for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that terrible femininity and it seems to</v>

844
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:10.471
<v Speaker 2>me to be invading the culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermining the masculine power of the </v>

845
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.170
<v Speaker 2>culture in a way that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fatal.</v>

846
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe</v>

847
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 3>I too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I too believe that these are symptomatic</v>

848
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.300
<v Speaker 3>of the decline of western culture and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

849
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 3>and it will just go down flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people realize that,</v>

850
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinity is still exists.</v>

851
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the world as a code among jihadist.</v>

852
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

853
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 3>and when you have Passionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinity,</v>

854
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Circling the borders like the hawaiians </v>

855
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:37.620
<v Speaker 3>and the vandals during the roman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's what I see.</v>

856
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I see this culture rotting from within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

857
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:42.720
<v Speaker 3>And and does all link itself literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>now my,</v>

858
00:40:42.721 --> 00:40:47.721
<v Speaker 3>I have an overview of why we're having </v>
<v Speaker 3>these problems and if it comes from the </v>

859
00:40:47.721 --> 00:40:48.910
<v Speaker 3>fact that I'm the product of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrant family.</v>

860
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:52.810
<v Speaker 3>All four of my grandparents and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother were born in Italy,</v>

861
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.960
<v Speaker 3>so I remember from my earliest years in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this factory town in upstate New York </v>

862
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.381
<v Speaker 3>where the y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my relatives came to work in the </v>

863
00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:01.381
<v Speaker 3>shoe factory.</v>

864
00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I can remember still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

865
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.980
<v Speaker 3>the life of the agrarian era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

866
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

867
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.630
<v Speaker 3>which for most of human history or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>agrarian era where there was the world </v>

868
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.640
<v Speaker 3>of men and the world of women and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex has had very little to do with each </v>

869
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:19.741
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each had power and status and its own </v>

870
00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:19.741
<v Speaker 3>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

871
00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:20.730
<v Speaker 3>And they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they laughed at each other in.</v>

872
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 3>In essence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the women had enormous power.</v>

873
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:28.771
<v Speaker 3>In Fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old women ruled not the young </v>

874
00:41:28.771 --> 00:41:28.771
<v Speaker 3>beautiful woman like today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

875
00:41:28.771 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 3>the older you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you had control over our </v>

876
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.250
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the mating and marriage.</v>

877
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

878
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.730
<v Speaker 3>there were no doctors so that you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

879
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.920
<v Speaker 3>the old women were like midwives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew all the ins and outs of this and </v>

880
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 3>inherited knowledge about pregnancy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other things.</v>

881
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can remember this.</v>

882
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the joy that women had with each </v>

883
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 3>other all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

884
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Cooking with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

885
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 3>a companions to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking,</v>

886
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 3>conversing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother remembered as a small child in</v>

887
00:41:56.901 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Italy when it was time to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>laundry,</v>

888
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 3>they would take the laundry up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>

889
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 3>up the hill to the fountain you'll ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

890
00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do it by hand.</v>

891
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 3>They would sing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would pick nick and so on.</v>

892
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we get a glimpse of that in the </v>

893
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.550
<v Speaker 3>odyssey when odysseus is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

894
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.530
<v Speaker 3>is thrown up naked on the shores of asia</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

895
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 3>and he hears the sound of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young women laughing and singing.</v>

896
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's nausicaa the princess bringing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the women to do the laundry where he's </v>

897
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:22.840
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

898
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.080
<v Speaker 3>so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each,</v>

899
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 3>each gender had its own hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its own values,</v>

900
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>own way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sexist rarely intersected.</v>

901
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Like I can remember in my childhood on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>holiday.</v>

902
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 3>TypiCal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be christmas,</v>

903
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Speaker 3>it could be a thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

904
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 3>All the women would be cooking all day </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

905
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Everyone would sit down to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

906
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.930
<v Speaker 3>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

907
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 3>The women who retire unmasked to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kitchen and the men would go,</v>

908
00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would look at the window and see all </v>

909
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:52.740
<v Speaker 3>the men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The men would be all outside,</v>

910
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.560
<v Speaker 3>usually gather around the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

911
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Then a time when cars didn't work as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as they do today with the hood up.</v>

912
00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the men would be standing with their</v>

913
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 3>hands on their hips like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's staring at the engine.</v>

914
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.850
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

915
00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 3>That's how I learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

916
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Men where we refreshing themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying something technical and </v>

917
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:10.690
<v Speaker 3>mechanical after being with women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

918
00:43:10.691 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for during the dinner.</v>

919
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

920
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.530
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all of these problems of today are </v>

921
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.021
<v Speaker 3>the direCt consequence of women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>emancipation and freedom from housework,</v>

922
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 3>thanks to capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

923
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Which made it possible for women to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs outside the home for the very first</v>

924
00:43:25.521 --> 00:43:30.521
<v Speaker 3>time in the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no longer to be dependent on a husband </v>

925
00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 3>or father or brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

926
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 3>And so this great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great thing that's happened to us,</v>

927
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 3>allowing us to be totally self </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting independent agents has </v>

928
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:44.831
<v Speaker 3>produced all this animosity about making</v>
<v Speaker 3>too many men and women because the </v>

929
00:43:44.831 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women feel unhappy.</v>

930
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Women Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever I go,</v>

931
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Italy or Brazil or england </v>
<v Speaker 3>or America or toronto,</v>

932
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.280
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

933
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:53.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

934
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.660
<v Speaker 3>the upper middle class professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>women are unhappy,</v>

935
00:43:56.661 --> 00:43:58.530
<v Speaker 3>miserable they want and they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

936
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 3>why they're unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to blame it on men.</v>

937
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.640
<v Speaker 3>The men must change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men must become more like women know </v>

938
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 3>that is the wrong way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

939
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:13.091
<v Speaker 3>It's when men are men and understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves as men are secure as men,</v>

940
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 3>then you are going to be happier.</v>

941
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing more dangerous than a </v>

942
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:19.620
<v Speaker 3>weak man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

943
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially all these quislings okay.</v>

944
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Spouting feminist rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear that.</v>

945
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it makes me sick,</v>

946
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:28.810
<v Speaker 3>but here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and women have never worked side by </v>

947
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>side ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe under farms.</v>

948
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:34.961
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were like maybe one person in </v>

949
00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:34.961
<v Speaker 3>the potato fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other ones over here in the.</v>

950
00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:35.300
<v Speaker 3>During the tOmatoes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

951
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

952
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had,</v>

953
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 3>you had familieS working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working side by side,</v>

954
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:42.120
<v Speaker 3>exhaust with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>no time to have it in any of this.</v>

955
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 3>It was a collaborative effort on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on forums and so on.</v>

956
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Never in all of human history have men </v>
<v Speaker 3>and women been working side by side and </v>

957
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 3>women are now the pressure about silicon</v>
<v Speaker 3>valley.</v>

958
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 3>There are also sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't allow women in and so on.</v>

959
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.620
<v Speaker 3>The men are being men in silicOn valley </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the women,</v>

960
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.850
<v Speaker 3>the engineers and the women are </v>
<v Speaker 3>demanding that,</v>

961
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is terrible.</v>

962
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.450
<v Speaker 3>You're being say maybe the sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

963
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.890
<v Speaker 3>HAve their own particular form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric.</v>

964
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Their own particular form of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

965
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

966
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:12.230
<v Speaker 3>We need to re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>re,</v>

967
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 3>re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>re examine.</v>

968
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This business about your,</v>

969
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:19.701
<v Speaker 3>the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we have to perhaps except some </v>

970
00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>degree of tension and conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sexes.</v>

971
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a work environment,</v>

972
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

973
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about women feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespected now.</v>

974
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Somehow they their opinions when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>express them.</v>

975
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are not taken seriously or or the.</v>

976
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Or even hillary clinton is complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

977
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:37.570
<v Speaker 3>when a woman writes something online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's attacked immediately so.</v>

978
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's attacked online.</v>

979
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is tough.</v>

980
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 3>The world is competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

981
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Identity is hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

982
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:49.131
<v Speaker 3>By conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there should be no </v>

983
00:45:49.131 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have to be in this bath at </v>

984
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 3>probation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just,</v>

985
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 3>we just devour it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

986
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:58.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely infant title in a </v>

987
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.370
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

988
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.370
<v Speaker 2>so a couple of things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

989
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.580
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>

990
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.630
<v Speaker 2>the agreeableness trait that divides men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women most.</v>

991
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 2>There's three things that divide women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and men most particularly from the </v>

992
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 2>psychometric perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that women are more agreeable </v>

993
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.521
<v Speaker 2>than men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that seems to be the primary </v>

994
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:13.521
<v Speaker 2>maternal dimension as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

995
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It's associated with a desire to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict,</v>

996
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's associated with interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>closeness,</v>

997
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politeness.</v>

998
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Women are reliably higher than men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the scandinavian countries</v>

999
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:29.241
<v Speaker 2>and in the countries where </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism has progressed the </v>

1000
00:46:29.241 --> 00:46:29.241
<v Speaker 2>farthest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's where the difference is.</v>

1001
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Maximize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things james demore </v>

1002
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Speaker 2>poInted out quite correctly and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>infamous google memo,</v>

1003
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are hIgher in negative emotion,</v>

1004
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Speaker 2>so that's anxiety and emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that difference is approximately the</v>

1005
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 2>same size and again that maximizes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian societies which is extremely</v>

1006
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:51.231
<v Speaker 2>interesting and then the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference is the difference in </v>

1007
00:46:51.231 --> 00:46:54.381
<v Speaker 2>interests between people and things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so women are more interested in people </v>

1008
00:46:54.381 --> 00:46:58.251
<v Speaker 2>and men are more interested in things </v>
<v Speaker 2>which goes along quite nicely with your </v>

1009
00:46:58.251 --> 00:47:01.281
<v Speaker 2>car anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about men interacting with</v>

1010
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:06.291
<v Speaker 2>men again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it isn't that they respect each </v>

1011
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:06.291
<v Speaker 2>other's viewpoints.</v>

1012
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens with a man,</v>

1013
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:12.350
<v Speaker 2>and I know a lot of men that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard as as remarkably tough people for</v>

1014
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 2>one reason or another and everything you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with them as a form of combat,</v>

1015
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 2>like if you want your viewpoint taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>

1016
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:24.590
<v Speaker 2>often you have to yell them down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're not going to stop talking </v>

1017
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 2>unless you start talking over them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1018
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's not like manner automatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving respect to other men because that</v>

1019
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

1020
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the combat is there and it's expected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the problems,</v>

1021
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:40.050
<v Speaker 2>and so this is part of the reason why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think men are being out of so much of </v>

1022
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:44.251
<v Speaker 2>academia and and maybe the academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>world in general and maybe the world in </v>

1023
00:47:44.251 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that men actually don't have any idea</v>

1024
00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:49.410
<v Speaker 2>how to compete with women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the problem is,</v>

1025
00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 2>is that if you unleash yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>

1026
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 2>then you're an absolute bully.</v>

1027
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if men unleash themselves on </v>

1028
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 2>other men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be pretty goddamn brutal.</v>

1029
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Especially for the men that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough.</v>

1030
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 2>and so that just doesn't happen with </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1031
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.170
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't unleash yourself completely</v>

1032
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a bully,</v>

1033
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 2>if you lose while you're just bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathetic.</v>

1034
00:48:11.861 --> 00:48:14.440
<v Speaker 2>So how the hell are you supposed to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>a game like that,</v>

1035
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've worked with lots of women in law</v>

1036
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:21.430
<v Speaker 2>firms in Canada for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and high achieving women,</v>

1037
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 2>like really remarkable people I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1038
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And they're often nonplussed I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the attitude of the man in the law </v>

1039
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.721
<v Speaker 2>firm because they would like to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone pulling together because </v>

1040
00:48:33.721 --> 00:48:36.961
<v Speaker 2>they're all part of the same team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the manner like at each other's </v>

1041
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:40.831
<v Speaker 2>throats in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cooperative way because they want </v>

1042
00:48:40.831 --> 00:48:44.311
<v Speaker 2>the law firm to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they want to be the person who's at </v>

1043
00:48:44.311 --> 00:48:44.980
<v Speaker 2>the top of the success hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1044
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:45.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1045
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.470
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't jive well with the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive or cooperative ethos.</v>

1046
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:55.471
<v Speaker 2>That's part and parcel of agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we don't really have any idea how</v>

1047
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 2>to integrate male and female dominance.</v>

1048
00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

1049
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.910
<v Speaker 3>This is why I love this show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real housewives and I,</v>

1050
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.860
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is scorings.</v>

1051
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 3>And jusT say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just last night I was watching one </v>

1052
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 3>episode right where the women were at </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1053
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At a party and not in,</v>

1054
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:12.320
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in recounting,</v>

1055
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 3>but I said this to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you said this to me and the men got.</v>

1056
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.630
<v Speaker 3>We got together there and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1057
00:49:17.631 --> 00:49:20.550
<v Speaker 3>this is the way they communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and innocent and that,</v>

1058
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

1059
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1060
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.790
<v Speaker 3>just we'll have a fistfight and wheel </v>
<v Speaker 3>him in 10 minutes later we're going to </v>

1061
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:28.250
<v Speaker 3>have a beer at the bar next to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and so on.</v>

1062
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.630
<v Speaker 3>And I have observed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mind,</v>

1063
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:31.540
<v Speaker 3>my daughter,</v>

1064
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 2>my daughter used to be really irritated </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that because she,</v>

1065
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:40.141
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most people was the target of </v>

1066
00:49:40.141 --> 00:49:42.440
<v Speaker 2>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conspiratorial bullying at one.</v>

1067
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.140
<v Speaker 2>She's no pushover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My daughter.</v>

1068
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 2>so this wasn't like this was a continual</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or that she didn't know what to do</v>

1069
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:52.501
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she used to observe these girls </v>

1070
00:49:52.501 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 2>conspiring against her and then black </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting your name on on facebook,</v>

1071
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:59.281
<v Speaker 2>which is part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part and parcel of the typical female </v>

1072
00:49:59.281 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 2>bullying routine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often reputation demolition,</v>

1073
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's a good literature on that.</v>

1074
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.440
<v Speaker 2>And Then she'd watched what would happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my brother or my son would have a </v>

1075
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.040
<v Speaker 2>dispute with his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:14.041
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they were drinking and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a dispute they'd have a fight and </v>

1077
00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:14.041
<v Speaker 2>then the next day they were friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1078
00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:17.801
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing that's strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that men have a way of bringing a </v>

1079
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>conflict to a head and resolving it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1080
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>And that it isn't obvious to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Women have that same,</v>

1081
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.680
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you might call it a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the case that men know </v>

1082
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.351
<v Speaker 2>what to do when they get into a conflict</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a woman because what the hell are </v>

1083
00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:32.351
<v Speaker 2>you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1084
00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 2>mostly what you're supposed to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid it.</v>

1085
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1086
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>

1087
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether this crosses into </v>

1088
00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:44.261
<v Speaker 3>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that there was a certain kind of </v>

1089
00:50:44.261 --> 00:50:45.440
<v Speaker 3>taunting and teasing that men and boys </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with each other that toughens them.</v>

1090
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1091
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 3>and where they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't take things seriously.</v>

1092
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 3>But a girl feelings become extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt if you hear something like that.</v>

1093
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:52.540
<v Speaker 3>It goes very tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1094
00:50:52.541 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sarcastic against her.</v>

1095
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:59.620
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do feel that there are profound </v>

1096
00:50:59.620 --> 00:50:59.870
<v Speaker 3>differences between the sexes and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of emotions,</v>

1097
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:05.020
<v Speaker 3>in terms of communication patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know my father used to say that he </v>

1098
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.750
<v Speaker 3>could never follow women's can </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

1099
00:51:05.751 --> 00:51:09.720
<v Speaker 3>He said he said women don't even finish </v>
<v Speaker 3>the finish sentences that with the women</v>

1100
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 3>understand immediately what the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman is saying.</v>

1101
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1102
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.760
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the women tend to be more </v>

1103
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.891
<v Speaker 3>interested in or haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionally more interested in soap </v>

1104
00:51:20.891 --> 00:51:23.471
<v Speaker 3>operas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the women who were home </v>

1105
00:51:23.471 --> 00:51:24.920
<v Speaker 3>without jobs is that I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that soap opera does reflect,</v>

1106
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 3>does mirror the way women talk to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1107
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.330
<v Speaker 3>There's these communication patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then built up through women,</v>

1108
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 3>the world of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1109
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Which was it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a division of labor.</v>

1110
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't sexism against women that </v>

1111
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.101
<v Speaker 3>there was a division of labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The men went off to hunt and did the </v>

1112
00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:44.411
<v Speaker 3>dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women stayed around the heart </v>

1113
00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:44.411
<v Speaker 3>because you had pregnant women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nursing women,</v>

1114
00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 3>older women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1115
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 3>They were cooking and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel that these communication </v>

1116
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.960
<v Speaker 3>patterns that we're talking about have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been built up over the centuries and the</v>

1117
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 3>men had to toughen each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1118
00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Do want to go out in the hunting part is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a native americans,</v>

1119
00:51:56.541 --> 00:52:01.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be gone for two weeks and it </v>

1120
00:52:01.541 --> 00:52:01.730
<v Speaker 3>was when the temperature was below zero </v>
<v Speaker 3>and many of didn't die.</v>

1121
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that somehow in any kind of </v>

1123
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.031
<v Speaker 3>separation of the sexes are different </v>
<v Speaker 3>spheres of the sexes is inherently </v>

1124
00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:12.490
<v Speaker 3>sexist power dynamic.</v>

1125
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 3>The answer to all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1126
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Then everything that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1127
00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is education into early history.</v>

1128
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until you are,</v>

1129
00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 3>until people understand the stone age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nomadic period,</v>

1130
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.140
<v Speaker 3>the agrarian era and ended up and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

1131
00:52:27.141 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 3>how civilization built up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1132
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 3>In mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great irrigation projects,</v>

1133
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.120
<v Speaker 3>or in orange Egypt where you head for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first centralized government </v>

1134
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.960
<v Speaker 3>authority became necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1135
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 3>To master these needs and you had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where an environmentally,</v>

1136
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.470
<v Speaker 3>a difficult situation like the deserts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mesopotamia or,</v>

1138
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.050
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peculiar character of,</v>

1139
00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 3>of Egypt and geography where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>only have a little tiny,</v>

1140
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.510
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fertile line along the edges of denial.</v>

1141
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.510
<v Speaker 3>OkAy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1142
00:52:56.511 --> 00:53:00.470
<v Speaker 3>desert landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this civilization and authority.</v>

1143
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1144
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I as not necessarily about power </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbing,</v>

1145
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:09.430
<v Speaker 3>but about organization to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 3>something for the good of the people as </v>

1146
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 3>a whole.</v>

1147
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the symbolism of the </v>

1148
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:16.530
<v Speaker 2>great for reducing</v>

1149
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.980
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to power and selfish power.</v>

1150
00:53:19.981 --> 00:53:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it is utterly naive.</v>

1151
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.070
<v Speaker 3>It's ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1152
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:26.790
<v Speaker 3>So I say education to be totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstituted,</v>

1153
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:30.530
<v Speaker 3>including public education to be getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most distant past it,</v>

1154
00:53:30.531 --> 00:53:35.531
<v Speaker 3>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our young people today who know </v>

1155
00:53:35.531 --> 00:53:37.551
<v Speaker 3>nothing about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the world was created that they </v>

1156
00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:37.551
<v Speaker 3>inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1157
00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:37.551
<v Speaker 3>Can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1158
00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 3>what marvelous technological paradise </v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in.</v>

1159
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's the product of capitalism as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the productive of individual innovation </v>

1160
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:49.640
<v Speaker 3>is the most of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the project will have a western </v>

1161
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:49.640
<v Speaker 3>tradition that everyone wants to trash </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is there,</v>

1162
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.380
<v Speaker 3>if you be getting the past and show it </v>
<v Speaker 3>also talk about war because the war is </v>

1163
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.730
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that wakes people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1164
00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 3>As we see wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wars,</v>

1165
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 3>the reality principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my father and all five of my uncles went</v>

1166
00:54:03.601 --> 00:54:08.601
<v Speaker 3>to world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father was part of the force that I </v>

1167
00:54:08.601 --> 00:54:09.420
<v Speaker 3>landed in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1168
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a paratrooper,</v>

1169
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1170
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:14.840
<v Speaker 3>at the time of the japanese surrender </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1171
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.060
<v Speaker 3>and a couple uncles got shot up and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1172
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.180
<v Speaker 3>when you have the reality of war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people see the reality of the </v>

1173
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.450
<v Speaker 3>horrors of war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>berlin burned to a crisp and,</v>

1174
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starvation.</v>

1175
00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you understand,</v>

1176
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:34.041
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a marvelous mechanism that </v>

1177
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:34.041
<v Speaker 3>brings water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1178
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:34.041
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

1179
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:37.270
<v Speaker 3>to the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you flip on a light looked </v>

1180
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.270
<v Speaker 3>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric,</v>

1181
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.270
<v Speaker 3>electricity.</v>

1182
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.270
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1183
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:40.340
<v Speaker 2>like I suppose it's because I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat of a depressive temperament.</v>

1184
00:54:40.341 --> 00:54:45.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one Thing that staggers me on a </v>

1185
00:54:45.341 --> 00:54:45.890
<v Speaker 2>consistent basis is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything ever works.</v>

1186
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean because it's so unlikely you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1187
00:54:48.231 --> 00:54:48.730
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1188
00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.160
<v Speaker 2>to be in a situation where our </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic communications work,</v>

1189
00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:57.310
<v Speaker 2>where our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where our electric grid works and it </v>

1190
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:57.310
<v Speaker 2>works all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1191
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:01.121
<v Speaker 2>It works a hundred percent of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that there </v>

1192
00:55:01.121 --> 00:55:04.391
<v Speaker 2>are mostly men out there who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking themselves into pieces </v>

1193
00:55:04.391 --> 00:55:06.230
<v Speaker 2>repairing this thing which just falls </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart all the time.</v>

1194
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I said this in the month debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

1195
00:55:08.741 --> 00:55:12.670
<v Speaker 3>In toronto several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that there's the invisible at all</v>

1196
00:55:12.671 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1197
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these elitist professors,</v>

1198
00:55:16.001 --> 00:55:21.001
<v Speaker 3>sneering at men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's men who are maintaining everything </v>

1199
00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:22.300
<v Speaker 3>around us and anything is an invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>army.</v>

1200
00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Which feminist don't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing would work</v>

1201
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.590
<v Speaker 2>or regarded regarded as impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

1202
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a professor is someone who's </v>

1203
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.200
<v Speaker 2>standing on a hill surrounded by a wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is surrounded by another wall </v>

1204
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.680
<v Speaker 2>which is surrounded by another wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's walls all the way down.</v>

1205
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Who stands uP there and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am brave and independent.</v>

1206
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got this protected area</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so unlikely.</v>

1207
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's so absolutely unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that people aren't on their</v>

1208
00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:52.881
<v Speaker 2>knees in gratitude all the time for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that we have central heating and </v>

1209
00:55:52.881 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 2>air conditioning and and pure water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable food,</v>

1210
00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:56.340
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>

1211
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable and</v>

1212
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 3>people used to die for then the water </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply was contaminated with cholera for</v>

1213
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:03.640
<v Speaker 3>heaven's sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1214
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:04.830
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1215
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:07.170
<v Speaker 3>That kept clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh milk,</v>

1216
00:56:07.171 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 3>fresh orange juice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things,</v>

1217
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:10.390
<v Speaker 3>these mro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nolan at the time,</v>

1218
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:14.090
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that western culture is heading,</v>

1219
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.190
<v Speaker 3>become because we are so dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this invisible infrastructure where a </v>

1220
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.830
<v Speaker 3>heading for an absolute catastrophe when</v>
<v Speaker 3>hottest,</v>

1221
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to paralyze the power </v>
<v Speaker 3>grid,</v>

1222
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.460
<v Speaker 3>the entire culture will be be chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have mobs in the street.</v>

1223
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and within three days.</v>

1224
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wIndow.</v>

1225
00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.260
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly the food supply is </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupted and there's no light.</v>

1226
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way to communicate.</v>

1227
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 3>There'll be like a robert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

1228
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 3>That is the way western culture is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to collapse.</v>

1229
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:44.911
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it won't take much because we are so</v>

1230
00:56:44.981 --> 00:56:47.240
<v Speaker 3>interconnected and now we are so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1231
00:56:47.241 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 3>It's so dependent on communications and </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers to the the I've,</v>

1232
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to predict for years there'll be </v>

1233
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:56.580
<v Speaker 3>an asteroid hitting there enough another</v>

1234
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.670
<v Speaker 2>the solar flares work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back in.</v>

1235
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.730
<v Speaker 2>This happens about once every century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back about 18,</v>

1236
00:57:02.731 --> 00:57:04.680
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't remember the exact year.</v>

1237
00:57:04.681 --> 00:57:07.050
<v Speaker 2>There was a significant enough solar </v>
<v Speaker 2>flare,</v>

1238
00:57:07.051 --> 00:57:09.270
<v Speaker 2>so that produces a electromagnetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulse,</v>

1239
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:14.271
<v Speaker 2>like a hydrogen bomb because the sun is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic </v>

1240
00:57:14.271 --> 00:57:18.531
<v Speaker 2>pulse will emerge from the sun and wave </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the earth and it produces huge </v>

1241
00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:22.671
<v Speaker 2>spikes in electrical electrical curd </v>
<v Speaker 2>along anything that's electronic and </v>

1242
00:57:22.671 --> 00:57:27.081
<v Speaker 2>it'll burn them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It led it lid telegraph operators on </v>

1243
00:57:27.081 --> 00:57:29.310
<v Speaker 2>fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things took out the quebec power grid in</v>

1244
00:57:29.311 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 2>1985 and knocked out the whole northeast</v>
<v Speaker 2>corridor.</v>

1245
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.400
<v Speaker 2>And so they figure those things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>about one in new century event.</v>

1246
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:40.700
<v Speaker 2>But those single.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my brother in law who's a very </v>

1247
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.190
<v Speaker 2>smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He designed the chip and the iphone.</v>

1248
00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:46.191
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about political issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time I went and saw him in san </v>

1249
00:57:46.191 --> 00:57:49.791
<v Speaker 2>francisco and his notion was that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the government should be doing </v>

1250
00:57:49.791 --> 00:57:53.571
<v Speaker 2>right now is stress testing our </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure the same way they stress </v>

1251
00:57:53.571 --> 00:57:55.560
<v Speaker 2>test the banks because we're so full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these single points of failure that.</v>

1252
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily we've been,</v>

1253
00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call,</v>

1254
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:04.910
<v Speaker 2>invaded by stupid terrorists instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart terrorists because it's a smart </v>

1255
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.931
<v Speaker 2>terrorists could do an unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of damage in a very short period </v>

1256
00:58:08.931 --> 00:58:12.441
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it's just god's good graces </v>

1257
00:58:12.441 --> 00:58:12.441
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't happened yet.</v>

1258
00:58:12.441 --> 00:58:12.441
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1259
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.440
<v Speaker 3>and then what will happen is that if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

1260
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:20.480
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the men will reconstruct civilization </v>

1261
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.531
<v Speaker 3>while the women cower in the houses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the men go out and do all the </v>

1262
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.020
<v Speaker 3>dirty work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to happen again.</v>

1263
00:58:24.021 --> 00:58:26.570
<v Speaker 3>only men will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will bring civilization back again.</v>

1264
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:28.890
<v Speaker 2>So what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1265
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.100
<v Speaker 2>So now a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1266
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.060
<v Speaker 2>the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've proposed,</v>

1267
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:39.061
<v Speaker 2>although it's something that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond my power that what should happen </v>

1268
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:43.081
<v Speaker 2>is that the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real content of the universities </v>

1269
00:58:43.081 --> 00:58:45.991
<v Speaker 2>should be stolen back from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities because they're not making </v>

1270
00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:48.571
<v Speaker 2>use of their intellectual property and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that something should be started online </v>

1271
00:58:48.571 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 2>that would constitute a genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

1272
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:54.390
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the accreditation issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's a solvable </v>

1273
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you see like all these people who</v>

1274
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:02.371
<v Speaker 2>have these postmodern neil marxist </v>
<v Speaker 2>agendas are completely embedded inside </v>

1275
00:59:02.371 --> 00:59:02.371
<v Speaker 2>the unit</v>

1276
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 3>and the point is over the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last 25 years,</v>

1277
00:59:05.951 --> 00:59:10.951
<v Speaker 3>I have received constant mail from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people dropping out of the graduate </v>

1278
00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:14.851
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I and r or giving up altogether on </v>

1279
00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 3>any idea of being a college professor </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what's happened is that the most</v>

1280
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:19.060
<v Speaker 3>talent than an independent thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have avoided in the school.</v>

1281
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 3>So we are now who we have on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>compliant.</v>

1282
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 3>The survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1283
00:59:23.151 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 3>The people who are currently in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and,</v>

1284
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 3>and hiring their successors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1285
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Are male educated themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1286
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went on the first letters I received </v>

1287
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.950
<v Speaker 3>and the early 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget it,</v>

1288
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 3>it was from a woman who was now a </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting houses in Missouri and said she</v>

1289
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:41.530
<v Speaker 3>had been part of the comparative </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature or a graduate program at,</v>

1290
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1291
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:46.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at berkeley and that she finally had to </v>

1292
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.691
<v Speaker 3>drop out because she said every time she</v>
<v Speaker 3>would express enthusiasm for what they </v>

1293
00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:51.510
<v Speaker 3>were reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the qa,</v>

1294
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 3>the people looked at her as if she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow encouraging an offense in other,</v>

1295
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:58.090
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm for art or new,</v>

1296
00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.920
<v Speaker 3>the very things you need as a teacher in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classroom.</v>

1297
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're being trained out</v>

1298
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.460
<v Speaker 2>your undergrad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you respect art and literature,</v>

1299
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 2>that means that you implicitly accept a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of quality.</v>

1300
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not to,</v>

1301
01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 2>of course contradicts the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenants of the postmodern doctrine,</v>

1302
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 2>which is that there are no hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 2>of quality.</v>

1303
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you.</v>

1304
01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.640
<v Speaker 2>You talked a little bit earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1305
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.900
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you referred again to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that everything is associated with </v>

1306
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>power and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that I can't.</v>

1307
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that I can't help but </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate with,</v>

1308
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:35.180
<v Speaker 2>with the kind of personality pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know from a psychometric </v>

1309
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:39.491
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best predictors of longterm success </v>

1310
01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our intelligence iq,</v>

1311
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>which you can measure very accurately </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trait conscientiousness,</v>

1312
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:45.620
<v Speaker 2>which actually is a real testament to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture,</v>

1313
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:50.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what you hope is that the smart </v>

1314
01:00:50.621 --> 01:00:50.621
<v Speaker 2>people who work hard are the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance it.</v>

1315
01:00:50.621 --> 01:00:50.621
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

1316
01:00:50.621 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>It isn't like they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1317
01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:57.461
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that if the culture is harnessing </v>

1318
01:00:57.461 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>the productive power of individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1319
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:03.670
<v Speaker 2>then it should differentially reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are smart and conscientious </v>

1320
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.851
<v Speaker 2>because they're going to do a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting work for the rest of </v>

1321
01:01:06.851 --> 01:01:06.851
<v Speaker 2>us and that that's very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>

1322
01:01:06.851 --> 01:01:11.561
<v Speaker 2>Finding it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as good as any finding in the </v>

1323
01:01:11.561 --> 01:01:14.051
<v Speaker 2>social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but despite that and despite the fact </v>

1324
01:01:14.051 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 2>that everything works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a god damn miracle of sorts,</v>

1325
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>there is this consistent story that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a patriarchy,</v>

1326
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:25.781
<v Speaker 2>that it's only oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's done nothing but oppressed </v>

1327
01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:28.271
<v Speaker 2>women since the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also something that just </v>

1328
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:28.271
<v Speaker 2>boggles my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1329
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:28.750
<v Speaker 2>like I knew</v>

1330
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.130
<v Speaker 3>that I have sacrificed for our women and</v>
<v Speaker 3>children cleaner their lives.</v>

1331
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For thousands of years,</v>

1332
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:36.600
<v Speaker 3>you know that and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been brutality,</v>

1333
01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:38.400
<v Speaker 3>but the battalion and the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1334
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1335
01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:44.181
<v Speaker 3>this sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The portrayal of human history is </v>

1336
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.840
<v Speaker 3>nothing but male oppression and female </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim manage.</v>

1337
01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:50.841
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a way to permanently ensure the </v>

1338
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:50.841
<v Speaker 3>infantilization of women.</v>

1339
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1340
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can even make the case from a </v>

1341
01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:55.960
<v Speaker 2>purely logical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1342
01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So here's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting thought.</v>

1343
01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:03.450
<v Speaker 2>So most of the people who abuse their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children were abused as children,</v>

1344
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>but most of the people who were abused </v>
<v Speaker 2>as children don't abuse their children.</v>

1345
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the population of </v>

1346
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:14.250
<v Speaker 2>abusers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all abused.</v>

1347
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.100
<v Speaker 2>So you can say abuse causes abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1348
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good idea because you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a specific sample there,</v>

1349
01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a sample.</v>

1350
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that abuse dampens out </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the centuries.</v>

1351
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:27.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't propagate itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's obvious because if there was,</v>

1352
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.970
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the hypothesis of essential men,</v>

1353
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
<v Speaker 2>male tyranny was true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would spread exponentially through </v>

1354
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.031
<v Speaker 2>the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like three generations and there </v>

1355
01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:40.221
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be an exception at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is even when there </v>

1356
01:02:40.221 --> 01:02:43.791
<v Speaker 2>is a tilt towards tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in the family or even in the </v>

1357
01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 2>society that regresses back to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's far more benign,</v>

1358
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:47.290
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

1359
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>You see this so</v>

1360
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 3>hit me when one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexamined issues is the transition from</v>

1361
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 3>the great extended family of old okay </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the nuclear family.</v>

1362
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And I do feel that freud is the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyst of the particular,</v>

1363
01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:05.290
<v Speaker 3>particular kind of claustrophobic cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1364
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 3>of the modern nuclear family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be the human being,</v>

1365
01:03:08.761 --> 01:03:10.860
<v Speaker 3>it could be that human beings were never</v>
<v Speaker 3>intended.</v>

1366
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be to be trapped in a house,</v>

1367
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.660
<v Speaker 3>just what their parents and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>extended families.</v>

1368
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 3>But you had your aunts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in grandparents and cousins,</v>

1369
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 3>all of whom helped form your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1370
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1371
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 3>what one's identity with one member of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>community rather than in just like hot </v>

1372
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.760
<v Speaker 3>house environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think a lot of current issues,</v>

1373
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>including the sudden spate of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender claims and so on,</v>

1374
01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of these things are coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1375
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unstable of in cell.</v>

1376
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a truly a prison cell of a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1377
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Two parents perhaps cannot give all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of life okay to,</v>

1378
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 3>to the young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

1379
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I think there are all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>

1380
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:51.850
<v Speaker 3>sexual issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1381
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.960
<v Speaker 3>in that are generated by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the psychology today is a,</v>

1382
01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 3>is now I would simply a matter of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>practical matter and people come in,</v>

1383
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:02.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1384
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 3>the psychologist in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with your,</v>

1385
01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:08.370
<v Speaker 3>your present problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not go into the distant past,</v>

1386
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:13.371
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just deal with our president </v>

1387
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:14.871
<v Speaker 3>problem which are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which obviously we have forms of </v>

1388
01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:15.060
<v Speaker 3>communication we need to like fix this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'll be fine.</v>

1389
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.360
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a complete absence of any kind </v>

1390
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 3>of analysis of your experiences as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>child with your parents,</v>

1391
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.540
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your siblings and so on.</v>

1392
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 3>How that might relate to your current </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual identity issues,</v>

1393
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.050
<v Speaker 3>whether it's transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's homosexuality,</v>

1394
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:31.710
<v Speaker 3>it has impact.</v>

1395
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:36.770
<v Speaker 3>You cannot possibly ask you about any </v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis of homosexuality today because </v>

1396
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.940
<v Speaker 3>that is automatically defined as </v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic.</v>

1397
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1398
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Speaker 3>every single as an openly gay person </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

1399
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I every gay person I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1400
01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>There is some story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There seems to be in childhood.</v>

1401
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a string similarity of the </v>

1402
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 3>storylines of all of my friends who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>

1403
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.420
<v Speaker 3>There's the same pattern that had to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with blurred borderlines,</v>

1404
01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 3>be between a son and his mother and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1405
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not blaming the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1406
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm not blaming the mother at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1407
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:08.260
<v Speaker 3>What I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I see as a dynamic going on the </v>

1408
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.731
<v Speaker 3>bourgeois house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the nuclear family where you had </v>

1409
01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:11.160
<v Speaker 3>sometimes a distant father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1410
01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>A father who was present but it but not </v>
<v Speaker 3>really engaged,</v>

1411
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.270
<v Speaker 3>and a mother who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1412
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:15.840
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1413
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.820
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who made the.</v>

1414
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Her companion is some way off in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother has great imagination and flare </v>

1415
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 3>and they had a shared thing and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that sexuality has nothing,</v>

1416
01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 3>whatever to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay with your family.</v>

1417
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Life is not good.</v>

1418
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also completely well.</v>

1419
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got a lot of trouble in Canada for</v>

1420
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:38.881
<v Speaker 2>my opposition to bill [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a bill that had to do with </v>

1421
01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:42.631
<v Speaker 2>transgender rights and I didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a damn about the transgender right </v>

1422
01:05:42.631 --> 01:05:45.751
<v Speaker 2>issue that had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What bothered me was that there was an </v>

1423
01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:49.261
<v Speaker 2>issue of Compelled speech because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were required by the ontario human </v>

1424
01:05:49.261 --> 01:05:51.700
<v Speaker 2>rights commission to use the pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that of the person's choice.</v>

1425
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

1426
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.010
<v Speaker 3>absolutely our wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutelY intolerable.</v>

1427
01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1428
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said years ago,</v>

1429
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my book sexual persona,</v>

1430
01:06:00.401 --> 01:06:02.350
<v Speaker 3>which was like a 700 page book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1431
01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:07.351
<v Speaker 3>that is the biggest sex change in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history because I okay with my </v>

1432
01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:10.951
<v Speaker 3>transgender issues all don't look to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnificent construction of english.</v>

1433
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the english language.</v>

1434
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I seized on the game,</v>

1435
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.400
<v Speaker 3>my identity and my power as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1436
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And therefore any intrusion into </v>
<v Speaker 3>english.</v>

1437
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Someone told me how to use english.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great gift.</v>

1438
01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1439
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.440
<v Speaker 3>this is absolutely obscene and evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to try to dictate to us how </v>

1440
01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 3>we're going to use this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this magnificent instrument of english.</v>

1441
01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1442
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:39.530
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was for me the breaking point </v>

1443
01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>because I believe well and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with the idea of the </v>

1444
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>logos in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:47.511
<v Speaker 2>because that's a deep mythological idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the logos is the thing that brings </v>

1446
01:06:47.511 --> 01:06:51.531
<v Speaker 2>order out of chaos through communicative</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and that that's tightly aligned </v>

1447
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>with your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't care if You're an atheist or</v>

1448
01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:55.710
<v Speaker 2>a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1449
01:06:55.711 --> 01:07:00.711
<v Speaker 2>It's still the right language and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has any right whatsoever under </v>

1450
01:07:00.711 --> 01:07:02.160
<v Speaker 2>any circumstances to trespass against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1451
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay because that's law in </v>

1452
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Canada now and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

1453
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:08.550
<v Speaker 2>So now back to your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>

1454
01:07:08.551 --> 01:07:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you were making a point about mine.</v>

1455
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I know we wouldn't grow so just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1456
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:22.910
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to look at these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>from obviously from multiple </v>

1457
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:26.061
<v Speaker 2>perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing the ideologues </v>

1458
01:07:26.061 --> 01:07:26.061
<v Speaker 2>don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>

1459
01:07:26.061 --> 01:07:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Because for them everything is one cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one.</v>

1460
01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>That's how you can tell when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with someone who's ideologically</v>

1461
01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:34.581
<v Speaker 2>possessed is they make everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributable to a single cause like </v>

1462
01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:34.581
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1463
01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but so one of the things that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the nuclear family that's quite </v>

1464
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:42.351
<v Speaker 2>interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that parents are older and they and </v>

1465
01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:45.870
<v Speaker 2>they have fewer children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine that that hot house</v>

1466
01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>environment in some sense as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated for a bunch of reasons,</v>

1467
01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:54.861
<v Speaker 2>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well your child is a lot more valuable </v>

1468
01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:56.430
<v Speaker 2>to you if you're older and you only have</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two right,</v>

1469
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.380
<v Speaker 2>because you're not going to get another </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

1470
01:07:58.381 --> 01:08:00.540
<v Speaker 2>That's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might've had some trouble having the</v>

1471
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:03.810
<v Speaker 2>child to begin with and you're not gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>get another chance.</v>

1472
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.090
<v Speaker 2>so you've got all your eggs are in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>basket,</v>

1473
01:08:06.091 --> 01:08:11.091
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course children don't have </v>

1474
01:08:11.091 --> 01:08:11.220
<v Speaker 2>the number of siblings they used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1475
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful about having siblings is that </v>

1476
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in your place,</v>

1477
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1478
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>their primary socialization agents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

1479
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>that can be brutal and that's reflected </v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the story of cain and abel,</v>

1480
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:28.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that internal household dynamic </v>

1481
01:08:28.361 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>with siblings can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can really become murderous and that has</v>

1482
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:30.470
<v Speaker 2>to be kept under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the,</v>

1483
01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:35.970
<v Speaker 2>the hothouse flower person who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's incapable of tolerating any jobs </v>

1484
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:39.860
<v Speaker 2>or any or any testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any dominance hierarchy,</v>

1485
01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 2>testing of the sort that you said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men do,</v>

1486
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:47.140
<v Speaker 2>part of that's the consequence of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised by older parents who have excess </v>

1487
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.101
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have no siblings because the child </v>

1488
01:08:51.101 --> 01:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>is then of course special and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialness.</v>

1489
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be an inverse </v>

1490
01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:59.471
<v Speaker 2>relationship between that specialness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's protected and the person's </v>

1491
01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 2>robustness and resilience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1492
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 2>and then that's caught into or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught in too.</v>

1493
01:09:03.621 --> 01:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a uh,</v>

1494
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.960
<v Speaker 2>pandered to by the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which insist upon setting up a situation</v>

1495
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 2>where no one is ever offended by </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1496
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:18.730
<v Speaker 2>any of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something I also can't </v>

1497
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:18.730
<v Speaker 2>understand it all because.</v>

1498
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Let me just say that's a huge point you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just made.</v>

1499
01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:24.051
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the upper middle class of </v>

1500
01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:25.680
<v Speaker 3>the professional class who posts paul </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having the children.</v>

1501
01:09:25.681 --> 01:09:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they go to law school,</v>

1502
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>they go to medical school in India and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the children after their </v>

1503
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>settled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1504
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>In the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

1505
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:33.090
<v Speaker 3>in a drop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1506
01:09:33.091 --> 01:09:34.930
<v Speaker 3>So they're the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1507
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 3>What were injected this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1508
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 3>this hypersensitive bourgeois id code </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1509
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>into the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now my,</v>

1510
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>my parents were 20 when they married in </v>
<v Speaker 3>21 when they had me.</v>

1511
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.480
<v Speaker 3>My father was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1512
01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:53.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went to college on the gi bill </v>

1513
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:53.580
<v Speaker 3>getting out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of world war two.</v>

1514
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 3>So when I was born my father was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>in college and was sweeping floors and </v>

1515
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:01.821
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the product of young parents and </v>

1516
01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:03.430
<v Speaker 3>nature once actually young parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1517
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Because because pregnancy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1518
01:10:05.081 --> 01:10:06.700
<v Speaker 3>is quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's safer.</v>

1519
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On.</v>

1520
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:08.990
<v Speaker 3>And my parents had the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1521
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.900
<v Speaker 3>To um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1522
01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 3>this youthful energy that we can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit that came out of world war two </v>

1523
01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:15.100
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of that.</v>

1524
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the only other sibling was born 14 </v>

1525
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:20.670
<v Speaker 3>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father,</v>

1526
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:25.671
<v Speaker 3>this point was a college professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she had completely different parents </v>

1527
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:26.170
<v Speaker 3>than than I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she,</v>

1528
01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:29.070
<v Speaker 3>she has very excellent manners and so I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's completely different.</v>

1529
01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1530
01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.880
<v Speaker 3>And I'll have all this like moving the </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy of my parents were just a lot of </v>

1531
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 3>other teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not today we have this situation.</v>

1532
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:41.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's considered heresy to raise this </v>

1533
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.910
<v Speaker 3>issue that you have have young women are</v>
<v Speaker 3>told,</v>

1534
01:10:41.911 --> 01:10:43.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one feature for you.</v>

1535
01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:44.760
<v Speaker 3>You are a future leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1536
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.650
<v Speaker 3>You must,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must move forward.</v>

1537
01:10:46.651 --> 01:10:51.651
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four years of college and it perhaps </v>

1538
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:51.651
<v Speaker 3>into the professional class.</v>

1539
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:52.970
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it may be the women,</v>

1540
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:57.540
<v Speaker 3>young women's bodies are signaling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be known.</v>

1541
01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Others maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1542
01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there are signals coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body weight of maybe not wanting this,</v>

1543
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.410
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1544
01:11:04.411 --> 01:11:06.670
<v Speaker 3>this system of education that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>devised for men.</v>

1545
01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This being funneled the long channel </v>

1546
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nepotism.</v>

1547
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So young women feel they don't know why </v>

1548
01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.730
<v Speaker 3>they feel they had no sense of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they,</v>

1549
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:21.731
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they want to marry and drop out of </v>

1550
01:11:21.731 --> 01:11:23.991
<v Speaker 3>college and have have a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be treated as traitors to </v>

1551
01:11:23.991 --> 01:11:27.531
<v Speaker 3>their class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you are future leaders have a baby </v>

1552
01:11:27.531 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 3>only working class women would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find working class women.</v>

1553
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In general.</v>

1554
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Far more rounded as personalities.</v>

1555
01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 3>The way they express themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>forcefully.</v>

1556
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>They have body language that takes up </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

1557
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.880
<v Speaker 3>A man says something to them on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>

1558
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 3>They're right back in their face and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1559
01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 3>It this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bourgeois girls.</v>

1560
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are taught to.</v>

1561
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>They're there because they are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

1562
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to postpone actual life.</v>

1563
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From for all these years,</v>

1564
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 3>they see these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other girls who are home who </v>

1565
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 3>misjudged the fraternity parties </v>
<v Speaker 3>setting.</v>

1566
01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:00.670
<v Speaker 3>These are the girls who like rotten for </v>
<v Speaker 3>parental protection and handholding on,</v>

1567
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.720
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the committee investigating what </v>

1568
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:05.720
<v Speaker 3>would run on their date and so on and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1569
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:05.720
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>

1570
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that yoU have located.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very interesting.</v>

1571
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.080
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1572
01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:13.380
<v Speaker 3>these young girls who are so sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1573
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 3>In college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm able to handle their sex life are</v>

1574
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:20.631
<v Speaker 3>the product of older parents because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they went through the professional </v>

1575
01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 3>career track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1576
01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:25.941
<v Speaker 3>and they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have not had the experience of the </v>

1577
01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:26.190
<v Speaker 3>competitiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1578
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.610
<v Speaker 3>end up in and teasing of other siblings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know how to.</v>

1579
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Well also the thing about young parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they don't care as much as older </v>

1580
01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.961
<v Speaker 2>parents and not actually turns out to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>better because what you really want for </v>

1581
01:12:38.961 --> 01:12:41.430
<v Speaker 2>your children is minimum necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

1582
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the developmental literature is </v>

1583
01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:46.650
<v Speaker 2>actually quite clear on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're at home with your child,</v>

1584
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.800
<v Speaker 2>what the best rule that you can play is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be there but not to be interacting </v>

1585
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.421
<v Speaker 2>with the child all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the child should be off doing whatever </v>

1586
01:12:56.421 --> 01:12:58.761
<v Speaker 2>it is the children do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which generally is playing with other </v>

1587
01:12:58.761 --> 01:12:58.761
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1588
01:12:58.761 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Without it being mediated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also by screens and,</v>

1589
01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>and technology because that's how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate their identity and that's how </v>

1590
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:09.051
<v Speaker 2>they learned to play games with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the parent is supposed to be </v>

1591
01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:12.591
<v Speaker 2>there as a recourse for the child when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go out a little bit farther than </v>

1592
01:13:12.591 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 2>they can tolerate in the half to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and get some security.</v>

1593
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't,</v>

1594
01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 2>that's especially not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two single children because they're </v>

1595
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 2>basically raised as miniature adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I wonder too,</v>

1596
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:27.141
<v Speaker 2>like how much of the antipathy towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are dark musings and I would say </v>

1597
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.570
<v Speaker 2>how much of the antipathy towards man </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being generated by say college </v>

1598
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:36.471
<v Speaker 2>age women is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep repugnance for the role that </v>

1599
01:13:36.471 --> 01:13:40.431
<v Speaker 2>they've been designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a disappointment with the man for </v>

1600
01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:40.431
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:42.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of those carpathian um,</v>

1602
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:42.950
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1603
01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:45.100
<v Speaker 2>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1604
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The basic marit marital routine was to </v>

1605
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 2>ride into the village and grab the bride</v>
<v Speaker 2>and runaway with her on a horse.</v>

1606
01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:59.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the like the motorcycle gang </v>

1607
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:00.660
<v Speaker 2>member who rips the too naive woman out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of girl,</v>

1608
01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:02.240
<v Speaker 2>out of the of family.</v>

1609
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.610
<v Speaker 3>There used to be bribed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing.</v>

1610
01:14:05.611 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It was quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite,</v>

1611
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.920
<v Speaker 3>quite widespread.</v>

1612
01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1613
01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:13.471
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of wonder if part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that modern university age women </v>

1614
01:14:13.471 --> 01:14:17.311
<v Speaker 2>aren't so art so angry is because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental feminine role is actually </v>

1615
01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:20.650
<v Speaker 2>being denied to them and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're objecting to that at a really,</v>

1616
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:23.190
<v Speaker 2>really fundamental level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a level of,</v>

1617
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.040
<v Speaker 2>of primitive outrage at</v>

1618
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.080
<v Speaker 3>what's happened is the chaos that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation of the sixties be released </v>

1619
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.610
<v Speaker 3>through the sexual revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went when I arrived in college in </v>

1620
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:35.610
<v Speaker 3>1964,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

1621
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 3>w the colleges were still acting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>local parentis in place of a parent.</v>

1622
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 3>So my dormitory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all women's dormitory,</v>

1623
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 3>we women had to sign in at 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

1624
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:50.970
<v Speaker 3>The men could run free the entire night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was my generation of women that </v>

1625
01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 3>rose up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give us the same freedom as men have and</v>

1626
01:14:53.951 --> 01:14:55.540
<v Speaker 3>the colleges replied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1627
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the world is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be raped.</v>

1628
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.150
<v Speaker 3>We have to protect you against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1629
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 3>And what we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1630
01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.500
<v Speaker 3>was give us the freedom to risk rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1631
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.600
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what that did,</v>

1632
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.090
<v Speaker 3>today's women don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a freedom that you want.</v>

1633
01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:13.850
<v Speaker 3>It's the same freedom that gay men have </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they go and they pick up a stranger</v>

1634
01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 3>or someplace they know it's dangerous.</v>

1635
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.710
<v Speaker 3>They know they could end up beaten up or</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

1636
01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they find it hot.</v>

1637
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.580
<v Speaker 3>If you want freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want equality,</v>

1638
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:26.610
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to stop behaving like a </v>

1639
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:27.340
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what we did is we gave freedom to</v>

1640
01:15:27.341 --> 01:15:29.650
<v Speaker 3>these young women for several </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations,</v>

1641
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:34.570
<v Speaker 3>but my generation had been raised and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>far more resilient and robust culture.</v>

1642
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the strength,</v>

1643
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:41.070
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To know what we wanted and to fight for </v>

1644
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:43.591
<v Speaker 3>what we wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These young women have been raised in </v>

1645
01:15:43.591 --> 01:15:43.591
<v Speaker 3>this protective terribly protected ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1646
01:15:43.591 --> 01:15:45.850
<v Speaker 3>So I think in some strAnge thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1647
01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:51.230
<v Speaker 3>the fashion that all of these demands </v>
<v Speaker 3>for intrusion from these stalinist </v>

1648
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:53.810
<v Speaker 3>committees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>

1649
01:15:53.811 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigating dates and so on.</v>

1650
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a way to re institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1651
01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 3>the rules that my generation through out</v>
<v Speaker 3>the window.</v>

1652
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:05.761
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think these young women are </v>

1653
01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:05.761
<v Speaker 3>desperate.</v>

1654
01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have spoken out very strongly in,</v>

1655
01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:07.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1656
01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 3>in a piece I wrote for time magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't my most recent book,</v>

1657
01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.390
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the raising the drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>age in this country.</v>

1658
01:16:13.391 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From 18 to 21.</v>

1659
01:16:15.101 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's had a direct result.</v>

1660
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In these,</v>

1661
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.290
<v Speaker 3>in these disasters of binge drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraternity parties because to la,</v>

1662
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:27.510
<v Speaker 3>let couch students the way we could go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out at as freshman have a beer sit any </v>

1663
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 3>protected adult environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn how to have discourse with the </v>

1664
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.960
<v Speaker 3>opposite sex in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a safe environment.</v>

1665
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>

1666
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.570
<v Speaker 3>And you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the.</v>

1667
01:16:36.571 --> 01:16:37.600
<v Speaker 3>And not today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1668
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:42.601
<v Speaker 3>Because because of the stupid role that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the young people can't even buy a drink </v>

1669
01:16:42.601 --> 01:16:46.530
<v Speaker 3>in a bar until they're 21.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have these fraternity parties that </v>

1670
01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:47.320
<v Speaker 3>are like the caveman era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1671
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:50.150
<v Speaker 3>of course in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this modern age disadvantages men,</v>

1672
01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.320
<v Speaker 3>gay men want to hook up and men wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have sex.</v>

1673
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Women don't understand what men want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women,</v>

1674
01:16:56.081 --> 01:17:01.081
<v Speaker 3>women I put out because they're hoping </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe the men will continue to be </v>

1675
01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:01.081
<v Speaker 3>interested in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1676
01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:01.880
<v Speaker 3>The man just wants to experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1677
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>That the hormones drive toward Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1678
01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1679
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.570
<v Speaker 3>I've theorized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1680
01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.470
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1681
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:10.260
<v Speaker 3>the sex drive in men is intertwined </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1682
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.110
<v Speaker 3>with hunted pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1683
01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel absolutely.</v>

1684
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 3>This is what women don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1685
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:20.171
<v Speaker 3>If it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if women understood what I </v>

1686
01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:20.171
<v Speaker 3>understand from my transgender </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1687
01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:21.610
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These women on the streets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

1694
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 3>young women who are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1698
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Just jogging the long line because I saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>these women do not understand the nature</v>

1699
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:53.591
<v Speaker 3>of the human mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do not understand the nature of </v>

1700
01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:53.591
<v Speaker 3>psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1701
01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And this intertwining them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the hunt,</v>

1702
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 3>the hunter pursued things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're triggering a hunter thing.</v>

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Just what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1706
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:10.060
<v Speaker 3>They are triggering the hunt game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A impulse in psychotic men.</v>

1707
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it here.</v>

1708
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.550
<v Speaker 3>There goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very appetizing and,</v>

1709
01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 3>and totally oblivious animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1710
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Bouncing along here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1711
01:18:18.351 --> 01:18:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>

1712
01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 3>we're in a period now where psychosis is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not understood at all.</v>

1713
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:27.341
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then a young women who has had no </v>

1714
01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:27.940
<v Speaker 3>exposure to movies like psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1715
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1716
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of rapists serial murder thing.</v>

1717
01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 3>So on the kind of strange dynamic that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do with it with an assault on the</v>

1718
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 3>mother and margo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1719
01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:38.690
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1720
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mind of the psychotic.</v>

1721
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:43.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think that is an incredible night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became these young women are emerging</v>

1722
01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:48.791
<v Speaker 3>and going to college and in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible environment of sec orgiastic </v>

1723
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.930
<v Speaker 3>sexual experience in fraternity houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're completely unprepared for it.</v>

1724
01:18:55.140 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're getting all this outrage </v>

1725
01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.911
<v Speaker 3>or feminist rhetoric has gotten more and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more extreme in its portrayal of men is </v>

1726
01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.870
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in fact what we have is a cast is a,</v>

1727
01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:09.871
<v Speaker 3>is a chaos in the sexual realm because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls have not been told anything </v>

1728
01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:13.110
<v Speaker 3>real in terms of biological substrate.</v>

1729
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:17.120
<v Speaker 2>There's full of lies about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes consent to.</v>

1730
01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's become something that's </v>

1731
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.210
<v Speaker 2>essentially portrayed linguistically as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sequence of progressive contracts,</v>

1732
01:19:24.211 --> 01:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1733
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:26.190
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1734
01:19:26.191 --> 01:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1735
01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:31.971
<v Speaker 2>I've thought for awhile that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the delusional fantasy of a </v>

1736
01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:35.301
<v Speaker 2>naive 13 year old girl that's basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>sums up our culture and I look at all </v>

1737
01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:38.230
<v Speaker 2>these sexual rules that permeate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1738
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.490
<v Speaker 2>the academia and I think two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I think As well,</v>

1739
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I know because I was an alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>researcher for a long time and you know </v>

1740
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>that fIfty percent of violent crimes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly attributable to alcohol.</v>

1741
01:19:49.561 --> 01:19:54.561
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's about a 50 percent chance that </v>

1742
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.201
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk and about a 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance that the person who kills you is </v>

1743
01:19:57.201 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the alcohol is the only drug that we</v>

1744
01:19:58.171 --> 01:20:00.270
<v Speaker 2>know that actually amplifies aggression.</v>

1745
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It does that in laboratory situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus it's a great disinhibitor,</v>

1746
01:20:03.781 --> 01:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what alcohol does is it,</v>

1747
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:10.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you to the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of your actions because if </v>

1748
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.230
<v Speaker 2>you ask someone who's drunk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of something stupid,</v>

1749
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 2>they can tell you what the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1750
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:20.810
<v Speaker 2>but it makes you not care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it does that because it's </v>

1751
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.810
<v Speaker 2>technically an exile lytic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1752
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like barbiturates or benzodiazepines.</v>

1753
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:28.161
<v Speaker 2>and it also has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an activating a property for many </v>

1754
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:29.200
<v Speaker 2>people who drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1755
01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a stimulant and a and an anxiolytic</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time in a very,</v>

1756
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 2>very potent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very potent for both of them.</v>

1757
01:20:36.181 --> 01:20:41.181
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put young people together and douse </v>

1758
01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>them in alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the binge drinking level.</v>

1759
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also interferes with memory </v>

1760
01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.071
<v Speaker 2>consolidation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course makes things much more </v>

1761
01:20:49.071 --> 01:20:51.231
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're surprised when there are </v>

1762
01:20:51.231 --> 01:20:53.631
<v Speaker 2>sexual misadventures and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's also attributed almost </v>

1763
01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:55.540
<v Speaker 2>purely to the predatory element that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1764
01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part and parcel of masculinity.</v>

1765
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:02.330
<v Speaker 2>But a true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tremenDous amount of that is also </v>

1766
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.330
<v Speaker 2>naive and stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 2>because we expect like eight to 18 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old guys,</v>

1768
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 2>especially the ones that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that haven't been successful with girls,</v>

1769
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:12.681
<v Speaker 2>which is like 85 percent of them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the successful men are a very small </v>

1770
01:21:12.681 --> 01:21:16.461
<v Speaker 2>percentage of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 85 percent who haven't been </v>

1771
01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:19.731
<v Speaker 2>successful with men or with women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what the hell they're </v>

1772
01:21:19.731 --> 01:21:22.251
<v Speaker 2>doing it all right in part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting drunk is to garner up </v>

1773
01:21:22.251 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 2>enough courage to actually make an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>

1774
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Because I think another thing that women</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand,</v>

1775
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:33.260
<v Speaker 2>especially with regards to young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just exactly how petrifying a </v>

1776
01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.710
<v Speaker 2>attractive woman who's of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat higher status actually is to a </v>

1777
01:21:37.771 --> 01:21:42.771
<v Speaker 2>young guy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of guys that wrIte me </v>

1778
01:21:42.771 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 2>constantly and people that I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that are so terrified of women,</v>

1779
01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:45.180
<v Speaker 2>they can't even talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

1780
01:21:45.181 --> 01:21:45.900
<v Speaker 2>very common.</v>

1781
01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take a very firm position,</v>

1782
01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 3>which is that I want college </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration so state totally out of </v>

1783
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.440
<v Speaker 3>the social lives of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a crime is committed,</v>

1784
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 3>it should be reported to the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been writing now for 20,</v>

1785
01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:00.310
<v Speaker 3>25 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1786
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.070
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the business of any college</v>

1787
01:22:03.071 --> 01:22:07.420
<v Speaker 3>administration to take any notice of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the students say to each other,</v>

1788
01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:10.030
<v Speaker 3>say to each other as well as do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1789
01:22:10.031 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to totally stop is fascism?</v>

1790
01:22:12.751 --> 01:22:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1792
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:14.790
<v Speaker 2>While you're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1793
01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fascism of the worst kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's an.</v>

1794
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:20.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a new kind of fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1795
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:23.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly generated by legislation.</v>

1796
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:26.400
<v Speaker 2>So the like the title nine men memo that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was written in 2011.</v>

1797
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I recently got a copy of that god damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1798
01:22:28.471 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 2>That was one polluting bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation.</v>

1799
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:35.811
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That memo basically told universities </v>

1800
01:22:35.811 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 2>that unless they set up a parallel court</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1801
01:22:35.911 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>they were going to be denied central </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>

1802
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely unbelievable.</v>

1803
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:43.550
<v Speaker 3>We had a ball and it will in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists are supporting list.</v>

1804
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1805
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.150
<v Speaker 3>That shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no authentic campus.</v>

1806
01:22:47.151 --> 01:22:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Leftism I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fraud.</v>

1807
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me think.</v>

1808
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 3>The faculty should be fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>

1809
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>You're on this federal federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation of how we're supposed to </v>

1810
01:22:58.821 --> 01:22:59.480
<v Speaker 3>behave on camp.</v>

1811
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be so how can you be so </v>

1812
01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:07.141
<v Speaker 2>naive and foolish to think that taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>an organization like the university,</v>

1813
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:12.601
<v Speaker 2>which already has plenty to do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing it to become a pseudo legal </v>

1814
01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:19.051
<v Speaker 2>system that parallels the legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly be anything but utterly </v>

1815
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:24.271
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would mean you have to know </v>

1816
01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:26.220
<v Speaker 2>absolutely nothing about the legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and about the tremendous period </v>

1817
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:30.181
<v Speaker 2>of evolution that produced what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a stellar system and an </v>

1818
01:23:30.181 --> 01:23:34.321
<v Speaker 2>adversarial system that protects the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights of the accused and of the end of </v>

1819
01:23:34.321 --> 01:23:38.281
<v Speaker 2>the victim and to replace that with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ad hoc bureaucracy that has pretty much </v>

1820
01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 2>essentially the same degree of power as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the court system with absolutely none of</v>

1821
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:44.330
<v Speaker 2>the training and none of the guarantees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get real cards.</v>

1822
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:50.670
<v Speaker 3>That piece that I wrote about date rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in january of 1991 a news day got</v>

1823
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.070
<v Speaker 3>the most controversial thing I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote in my entire career.</v>

1824
01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:59.071
<v Speaker 3>I attack the entire thing and I demanded</v>
<v Speaker 3>the college has standing back and get </v>

1825
01:23:59.071 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 3>out of the social lives of the students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on and people.</v>

1826
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:05.870
<v Speaker 3>The reaction people tried to recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called the president of my </v>

1827
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:06.430
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to get me fired.</v>

1828
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 3>You can believe in hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1829
01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can believe it.</v>

1830
01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It won't cost them anything and it.</v>

1831
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:17.120
<v Speaker 3>If anything that says to women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1832
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.260
<v Speaker 3>but they should be responsible for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own choices is regarded as reactionary.</v>

1833
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Are they kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1834
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>This is such a big trail of authentic </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism in my view.</v>

1835
01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the ultimate betrayal of authentic </v>

1836
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>feminism because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1837
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:36.970
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an invitation of all the things </v>

1838
01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:38.910
<v Speaker 2>that you might be paranoid about with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to the patriarchy back into your</v>

1839
01:24:38.911 --> 01:24:39.480
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1840
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 2>It's an insistence that the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrusive part of the tie,</v>

1841
01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:45.900
<v Speaker 2>ironical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>king come and take control over the most</v>

1842
01:24:45.901 --> 01:24:48.190
<v Speaker 2>intimate details of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

1843
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:54.150
<v Speaker 2>On the assumption is that that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make your life better rather than </v>

1844
01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:54.150
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1845
01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not to mention this idea of,</v>

1846
01:24:55.451 --> 01:24:55.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1847
01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.370
<v Speaker 3>the stages of verbal consent as if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as if your impulse is based in the body,</v>

1848
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:05.430
<v Speaker 3>have anything to do with words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that's the whole point is you </v>

1849
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to abandon,</v>

1850
01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:07.080
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1851
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:10.830
<v Speaker 3>that part of the brain that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it traveled with words.</v>

1852
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

1853
01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.060
<v Speaker 2>actually a marker of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of lack of social ability to have to do </v>

1854
01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:21.761
<v Speaker 2>that because if you're a sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like if you're dancing with </v>

1855
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:22.670
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you call out the moves,</v>

1856
01:25:22.671 --> 01:25:24.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to do that,</v>

1857
01:25:24.321 --> 01:25:25.550
<v Speaker 2>well then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1858
01:25:25.551 --> 01:25:27.920
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more worse than the neophyte,</v>

1859
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:32.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an awkward neophyte fight and </v>

1860
01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:32.970
<v Speaker 2>anybody with any sense should get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell away from you.</v>

1861
01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're reduced to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have to verbally negotiate </v>

1862
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.021
<v Speaker 2>every element of intimate interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what a downer that eds.</v>

1863
01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:42.100
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

1864
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:44.810
<v Speaker 2>what an unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

1865
01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Naive and pathological view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner in which human beings interact.</v>

1866
01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no sophistication in that.</v>

1867
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm worried about also in this age </v>

1868
01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:55.860
<v Speaker 3>of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1869
01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a teacher in the classroom,</v>

1870
01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:00.970
<v Speaker 3>that the young people are so used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating now by cell phone.</v>

1871
01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My iphone,</v>

1872
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're losing body language and facial </v>

1873
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:07.900
<v Speaker 3>expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1874
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Which I think is going to compound the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with these dating,</v>

1875
01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>encounters.</v>

1876
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the ability to read the human </v>

1877
01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:17.560
<v Speaker 3>face and into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

1878
01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.181
<v Speaker 3>into read little tiny inflections of </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion was I think my generation got </v>

1879
01:26:22.181 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 3>that from looking at great foreign films</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1880
01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:29.130
<v Speaker 3>with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our long takes because you'd have </v>

1881
01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 3>jon morrow and catherine deneuve in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a potential romantic encounters and you </v>

1882
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:34.600
<v Speaker 3>could use to the tiniest little little </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflections that,</v>

1883
01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 3>that signal communication or sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>readiness or,</v>

1884
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 3>or irony or skepticism or distance or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1885
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:44.930
<v Speaker 3>But the inability to read the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's intentions.</v>

1886
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:49.931
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I think this is going to be a </v>

1887
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:49.931
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy,</v>

1888
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:49.931
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just noticed that,</v>

1889
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how year by year,</v>

1890
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The students are becoming much more flat</v>

1891
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.840
<v Speaker 3>affect and they in themselves complained</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they'll sit in the same room with </v>

1892
01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.170
<v Speaker 3>someone and be texting to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1893
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:06.171
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a piece of evidence to that </v>

1895
01:27:06.171 --> 01:27:08.181
<v Speaker 2>supports that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So women with brothers are less likely </v>

1896
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:12.201
<v Speaker 2>to get raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that they've </v>

1897
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:13.530
<v Speaker 2>learned that nonverbal language deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1898
01:27:13.531 --> 01:27:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1899
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:15.600
<v Speaker 2>they can spot the.</v>

1900
01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1901
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I have noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1902
01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>

1903
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.410
<v Speaker 3>in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1904
01:27:20.411 --> 01:27:23.670
<v Speaker 3>That the women who have many brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1905
01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Are very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1906
01:27:26.411 --> 01:27:29.230
<v Speaker 3>As administrators and as business </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1907
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 3>because they don't take men seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1908
01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.580
<v Speaker 3>They regard but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1909
01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:35.710
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they saw their brothers.</v>

1910
01:27:35.711 --> 01:27:37.150
<v Speaker 3>They were brothers are jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1911
01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.150
<v Speaker 3>But they know how to control men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1912
01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.110
<v Speaker 3>While it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they still like men.</v>

1913
01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They admired man.</v>

1914
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that I have seen </v>

1915
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.510
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly</v>

1916
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:50.220
<v Speaker 2>that would be also reflective of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem of fewer and fewer siblings.</v>

1917
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1918
01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've noticed this in publishing.</v>

1920
01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that the,</v>

1921
01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:56.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1922
01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 3>the women who have this job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the job of publicist.</v>

1923
01:27:59.001 --> 01:28:04.001
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And rise to the top is as manager of </v>

1924
01:28:04.001 --> 01:28:04.001
<v Speaker 3>publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1925
01:28:04.001 --> 01:28:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Their ability to take charge of men and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1926
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.840
<v Speaker 3>and they're humorous men that like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of in and they have great </v>

1927
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.571
<v Speaker 3>relationships with men because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have the sense of resentment and </v>

1928
01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:13.571
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1929
01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:16.310
<v Speaker 3>in worry and anxiety and they don't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>men as aggressors.</v>

1930
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1931
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's another thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as feminism,</v>

1932
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1933
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:26.411
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved into its presence in assistant </v>

1934
01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:26.411
<v Speaker 3>videology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1935
01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It has tended to denigrate motherhood </v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1936
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 3>as a lesser order of human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1937
01:28:31.551 --> 01:28:33.190
<v Speaker 3>and to enshrine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course abortion.</v>

1938
01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:38.210
<v Speaker 3>I am 100 percent of abortion rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I belonged to planned parenthood for </v>

1939
01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:40.100
<v Speaker 3>years until I finally rejected it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>branch of the democratic party,</v>

1940
01:28:40.110 --> 01:28:41.300
<v Speaker 3>my party and so on.</v>

1941
01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1942
01:28:42.181 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 3>but as motherhood became excluded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1943
01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:46.700
<v Speaker 3>as feminism became obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1944
01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:48.030
<v Speaker 3>With the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1945
01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 3>with a professional woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1946
01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:54.170
<v Speaker 3>I feel that the lessons are that mothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn had been lost.</v>

1947
01:28:54.171 --> 01:28:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:55.670
<v Speaker 3>To to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1949
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:56.660
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feminism,</v>

1950
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:58.780
<v Speaker 3>which is okay if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1951
01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mothers who who bear boy children.</v>

1952
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understand the fragility of men,</v>

1953
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 3>the fragility and boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They understand it.</v>

1954
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't seem to boys.</v>

1955
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And then as a menace they understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the greatest strength of women.</v>

1956
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this tenderness and </v>

1957
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.451
<v Speaker 3>connectedness between the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the mother and the and the boy </v>

1958
01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:20.451
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1959
01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>W when motherhood is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of,</v>

1960
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 3>of women who are discussing gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we have today is this,</v>

1961
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:32.421
<v Speaker 3>this does gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lg has risen up on campuses where </v>

1962
01:29:32.421 --> 01:29:32.421
<v Speaker 3>we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of the.</v>

1963
01:29:32.421 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 3>None of the girls know the students have</v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

1964
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 3>None of them had children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1965
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 3>And you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have women.</v>

1966
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:41.511
<v Speaker 3>Some of them have had children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them are lesbians or like </v>

1967
01:29:41.511 --> 01:29:41.730
<v Speaker 3>or like arguing or like professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>women and so on.</v>

1968
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this whole tenderness and </v>

1969
01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:46.760
<v Speaker 3>forgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgiveness.</v>

1970
01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And encouragement that women do to two </v>

1971
01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:50.800
<v Speaker 3>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1972
01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.430
<v Speaker 3>The fragility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand this </v>

1973
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.430
<v Speaker 3>hypersensitivity of boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not understood.</v>

1974
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead button.</v>

1975
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Boys are seen as somehow a more </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged.</v>

1976
01:29:58.231 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somehow,</v>

1977
01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:00.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1978
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1979
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:03.690
<v Speaker 3>their energy level is interpreted as </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression.</v>

1980
01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Potential violence and so on.</v>

1981
01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1982
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1983
01:30:07.361 --> 01:30:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that that is what we would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1984
01:30:10.831 --> 01:30:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we would have.</v>

1985
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I have proposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1986
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:17.110
<v Speaker 3>That colleges should allow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment a woman is entered,</v>

1987
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.210
<v Speaker 3>it's entered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1988
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.860
<v Speaker 3>She has entrusted at college for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1989
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And that she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she should be free to leave.</v>

1990
01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To have babies when she,</v>

1991
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:31.851
<v Speaker 3>when her body wants that babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's healthy to have them and then </v>

1992
01:30:31.851 --> 01:30:35.271
<v Speaker 3>return have heaven had the occasional </v>
<v Speaker 3>course again build up credits and </v>

1993
01:30:35.271 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 3>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might be able to do it as as </v>

1994
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 3>well and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get married.</v>

1995
01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women with children into the classroom.</v>

1996
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:44.310
<v Speaker 3>The moment that happens and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened after world war ii.</v>

1997
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've hit a lot of married guys in the </v>

1998
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:49.330
<v Speaker 3>classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1999
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:49.330
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>

2000
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Not that many women experience of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>married person with a family talking </v>

2001
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:58.341
<v Speaker 3>about gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of them gender stuff will be </v>

2002
01:30:58.341 --> 01:30:58.341
<v Speaker 3>laughed out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2003
01:30:58.341 --> 01:31:01.130
<v Speaker 3>If you had a real mother in there who </v>
<v Speaker 3>would experienced childbirth and had had</v>

2004
01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 3>rate and it was raising boys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumer,</v>

2005
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:07.620
<v Speaker 3>why do I think that that's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that has led to this,</v>

2006
01:31:07.621 --> 01:31:12.621
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this incredible art artificiality and </v>

2007
01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:12.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hysteria.</v>

2008
01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feminist rhetoric.</v>

2009
01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another strange element to that </v>

2010
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.550
<v Speaker 2>which is that on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical feminist types,</v>

2011
01:31:22.551 --> 01:31:27.551
<v Speaker 2>the neo marxist postmodernists are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very much opposed to the patriarchy,</v>

2012
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:30.020
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2013
01:31:30.021 --> 01:31:32.390
<v Speaker 2>that unidimensional ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented</v>

2014
01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.680
<v Speaker 3>mean perhaps the word can be applied to </v>
<v Speaker 3>republican rome and that's it.</v>

2015
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2016
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe it can be applied </v>

2017
01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:44.081
<v Speaker 2>usefully to certain kinds of tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to a society that's actually </v>

2018
01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:44.081
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

2019
01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Victorian england one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguably.</v>

2020
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But other than that,</v>

2021
01:31:47.391 --> 01:31:50.280
<v Speaker 3>and to use the word patriarchy and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended at a slapdash way.</v>

2022
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:52.770
<v Speaker 3>So feel emma tourists are absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2023
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:57.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shows people know nothing about </v>

2024
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.790
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever have you ever had,</v>

2025
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.790
<v Speaker 3>had done no reading.</v>

2026
01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what confuses me about is that </v>

2027
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.651
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that the patriarch is </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewed as this essentially evil entity </v>

2028
01:32:04.651 --> 01:32:09.570
<v Speaker 2>and that that's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine energy that built this </v>

2029
01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:11.530
<v Speaker 2>oppressive structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antithesis of that,</v>

2030
01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:14.410
<v Speaker 2>which would actually be femininity as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell,</v>

2031
01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:19.411
<v Speaker 2>which is tightly associated with care </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with child rearing is also </v>

2032
01:32:19.411 --> 01:32:23.251
<v Speaker 2>denigrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the only proper role for </v>

2033
01:32:23.251 --> 01:32:26.641
<v Speaker 2>women to adopt is a patriarchal role </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that the patriarchy is </v>

2034
01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:30.931
<v Speaker 2>something that's entirely corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothesis seems to be that the </v>

2035
01:32:30.931 --> 01:32:33.130
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy would be just fine if women </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran it.</v>

2036
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 2>So no changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that would just be a </v>

2037
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 2>transformation of leadership and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

2038
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:44.010
<v Speaker 2>that would rectify the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem even though it's hypothetically </v>

2039
01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be structural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2040
01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to close with something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2041
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:52.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are elements in my character that </v>

2042
01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:52.740
<v Speaker 2>are optimistic.</v>

2043
01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2044
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I've looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2045
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:59.161
<v Speaker 2>I worked for the un committee and on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between economic </v>

2046
01:32:59.161 --> 01:32:59.230
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability,</v>

2047
01:32:59.231 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and I found out a variety of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were very optimistic.</v>

2048
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Like the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2049
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.620
<v Speaker 2>tom set out to have poverty between 2000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 2015 worldwide and actually hit that</v>

2050
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 2>by about 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2051
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 2>So we're in the period of the fastest </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation of the bottom strata of </v>

2052
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:20.101
<v Speaker 2>the world's population into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximating middleclass that's ever </v>

2053
01:33:20.101 --> 01:33:23.921
<v Speaker 2>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's all these great </v>

2054
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:25.621
<v Speaker 2>technological innovations on the horizon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it looks to me like things could go </v>

2055
01:33:25.621 --> 01:33:30.360
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well if we were careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's </v>

2056
01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.221
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pessimistic because I also see that </v>

2057
01:33:35.221 --> 01:33:37.831
<v Speaker 2>there's five or six things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of which appear at the level of </v>

2058
01:33:37.831 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe that are all happening at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

2059
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:44.581
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I'd like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask you is like what do you see </v>

2060
01:33:44.581 --> 01:33:48.721
<v Speaker 2>happening in the next 10 years in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the universities are in culture at </v>

2061
01:33:48.721 --> 01:33:52.441
<v Speaker 2>large and I mean you just put forward a </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposal for the universities for the </v>

2062
01:33:52.441 --> 01:33:53.020
<v Speaker 2>treatment of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very interesting.</v>

2063
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:55.300
<v Speaker 2>One because women do have a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframe than men,</v>

2064
01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>but like what the hell is the proper way</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward?</v>

2065
01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:02.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been encouraging young men to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and to take responsibility and</v>

2066
01:34:02.621 --> 01:34:04.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge market for that message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2067
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.940
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not convinced by any stretch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the imagination that it's enough.</v>

2068
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.720
<v Speaker 2>What like when you look forward and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to be optimistic,</v>

2069
01:34:13.721 --> 01:34:14.890
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you see?</v>

2070
01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the largest scale,</v>

2071
01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:23.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned about the future western </v>

2072
01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.251
<v Speaker 3>culture because as a student of history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks too much to me like ancient </v>

2073
01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:27.740
<v Speaker 3>rome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2074
01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Which became overexpanded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2075
01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 3>which became a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at the mercy of a bureaucratic,</v>

2076
01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:35.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2077
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.600
<v Speaker 3>the creep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2078
01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:39.770
<v Speaker 3>And can you imagine one of yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2079
01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:45.170
<v Speaker 3>And in and roman identity eventually got</v>
<v Speaker 3>blurred.</v>

2080
01:34:45.381 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

2081
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.860
<v Speaker 3>in the incorporation of so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different cultures,</v>

2082
01:34:48.861 --> 01:34:51.290
<v Speaker 3>which at first seemed like a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of multiculturalism,</v>

2083
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.350
<v Speaker 3>but eventually overexpand and simply </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse of its own way.</v>

2084
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2085
01:34:55.221 --> 01:35:00.221
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I am concerned what the weather </v>

2086
01:35:00.221 --> 01:35:03.400
<v Speaker 3>western culture is in a rapid decline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be very easy because we</v>

2087
01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:07.170
<v Speaker 3>are so interconnected and so overcomplex</v>
<v Speaker 3>very easy,</v>

2088
01:35:07.171 --> 01:35:08.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring it to ruin.</v>

2089
01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:11.210
<v Speaker 3>It would only take one major natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>disaster,</v>

2090
01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that,</v>

2091
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.150
<v Speaker 3>but the university themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2092
01:35:14.151 --> 01:35:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I think people are all of a sudden in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>

2093
01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:22.210
<v Speaker 3>much more attentive to issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness because of the </v>

2094
01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>riots at berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the,</v>

2095
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:26.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the capital of free speech.</v>

2096
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the free speech movement happened in the</v>

2097
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:35.650
<v Speaker 3>spring before I entered college in 1964 </v>
<v Speaker 3>to one of the great principles and </v>

2098
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 3>inspirational stories of my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mario savio was an assertion of,</v>

2099
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the supremacy of free thought and </v>

2100
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 3>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These.</v>

2101
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2102
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:46.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that perhaps,</v>

2103
01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:49.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might just have turned a corner,</v>

2104
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:54.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to take a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time for the university to be </v>

2105
01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.220
<v Speaker 3>reformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel that the cafeteria menu,</v>

2106
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:55.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2107
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:58.220
<v Speaker 3>of the university curriculum has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned.</v>

2108
01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.350
<v Speaker 3>That we must return to historical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2109
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:05.550
<v Speaker 3>courses that begin in the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 3>period and this donation,</v>

2110
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:07.310
<v Speaker 3>antiquity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to give perspective,</v>

2111
01:36:07.311 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2112
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:12.671
<v Speaker 3>to our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to our present an analysis of our </v>

2113
01:36:12.671 --> 01:36:14.530
<v Speaker 3>president at culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a 50 slash 50 to 75 percent of </v>

2114
01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:16.270
<v Speaker 3>college administrators fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2115
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.380
<v Speaker 3>And the money be transferred over to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2116
01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to faculty into libraries,</v>

2117
01:36:21.111 --> 01:36:22.540
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into instruction.</v>

2118
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2119
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2120
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2121
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 3>obviously the way things are being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being trained right now,</v>

2122
01:36:29.571 --> 01:36:31.450
<v Speaker 3>including at the public school level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2123
01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Is I think that I think the public </v>
<v Speaker 3>school level has gone to hell.</v>

2124
01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2125
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2126
01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:36.010
<v Speaker 3>when my mother came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2127
01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:38.730
<v Speaker 3>came to United States at age of six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

2128
01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.760
<v Speaker 3>the old public school system was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>strict and therefore she has an </v>

2129
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.610
<v Speaker 3>excellent education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2130
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.930
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2131
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:50.950
<v Speaker 3>did got all a's in her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her even though she started out in </v>

2132
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 3>not speaking english,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke without an accent,</v>

2133
01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2134
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 3>So today this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of feel good.</v>

2135
01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 3>The public school education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2136
01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:00.800
<v Speaker 3>which is a form of ideology in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation right now.</v>

2137
01:37:00.801 --> 01:37:02.870
<v Speaker 3>so it's all about the no bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2138
01:37:02.871 --> 01:37:07.871
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not about anything seriously about </v>

2139
01:37:07.871 --> 01:37:07.871
<v Speaker 3>no bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2140
01:37:07.871 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

2141
01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I can tell them in my own students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been teaching for 46 years </v>

2142
01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:15.380
<v Speaker 3>so I can tell them this slow degradation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of public school education.</v>

2143
01:37:15.381 --> 01:37:20.381
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to the point now that the </v>

2144
01:37:20.381 --> 01:37:22.750
<v Speaker 3>students have absolutely no sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>world geography of world history and </v>

2145
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:26.740
<v Speaker 3>they know absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know anything about wars and </v>

2146
01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 3>the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the barbaric reality of most of human </v>

2147
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2148
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 3>And what are triggers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a fantastic culture we live in.</v>

2149
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:37.460
<v Speaker 3>And so now identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics itself has just got to</v>

2150
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:38.900
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was important.</v>

2151
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a rebel against the wasps.</v>

2152
01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Had gemini.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2153
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 3>New white anglo saxon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protestant gemini.</v>

2154
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.610
<v Speaker 3>In american culture it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was suffocating.</v>

2155
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:54.611
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was raised in the 19 fifties when </v>

2156
01:37:54.611 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 3>wasps controlled corporations and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2157
01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:57.880
<v Speaker 3>and education and politics and so on.</v>

2158
01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 3>And so identity politics was necessary </v>
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>

2159
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we asserted gay rights?</v>

2160
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:08.541
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was it was stonewall rebellion of </v>

2161
01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:08.541
<v Speaker 3>1969.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We assert,</v>

2162
01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:09.310
<v Speaker 3>we asserted okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women's rights with a,</v>

2163
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:12.450
<v Speaker 3>with the rebirth of second wave feminism</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the late 19 sixties.</v>

2164
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this endless,</v>

2165
01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:19.221
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preoccupation with with a a fragmented </v>

2166
01:38:19.221 --> 01:38:21.831
<v Speaker 3>Identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we must return to the authentic that </v>

2167
01:38:21.831 --> 01:38:21.831
<v Speaker 3>needs six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His vision,</v>

2168
01:38:21.831 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 3>which is about identity coming from </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness which transcends gender,</v>

2169
01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.200
<v Speaker 3>which transcends all these divisions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>race and ethnicity.</v>

2170
01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness itself.</v>

2171
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now there's no sense of that any </v>

2172
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 3>longer and that's what the 19 sixties.</v>

2173
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>That is a complete abandonment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility because that </v>

2174
01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:47.390
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think symbolically and I got a lot of </v>

2175
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.390
<v Speaker 2>this from yoga and also for american </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

2176
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the great logos of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>

2177
01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:50.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the transcendent principle,</v>

2178
01:38:50.551 --> 01:38:55.551
<v Speaker 2>which is his respect for the primacy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual consciousness and what goes </v>

2179
01:38:55.951 --> 01:38:58.290
<v Speaker 2>along with that primarily isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual rights.</v>

2180
01:38:58.291 --> 01:39:03.291
<v Speaker 2>Although that's built into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the reason we have </v>

2181
01:39:03.291 --> 01:39:03.291
<v Speaker 2>individual rights is for respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2182
01:39:03.291 --> 01:39:08.270
<v Speaker 2>but the responsibility that comes along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with being an individual instead of the </v>

2183
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:09.420
<v Speaker 2>member of some group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in victimized group,</v>

2184
01:39:09.421 --> 01:39:14.421
<v Speaker 2>which is like the assure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an article with one of my </v>

2185
01:39:14.421 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 2>students who had toured the mass grave </v>
<v Speaker 2>sites and in the former yugoslavia,</v>

2186
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:21.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have been exposed to that sort of </v>

2187
01:39:21.771 --> 01:39:23.901
<v Speaker 2>thing and one of the things that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>research indicated was that the best </v>

2188
01:39:23.901 --> 01:39:28.251
<v Speaker 2>predictor of genocide is a victimization</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the part of the group that produces </v>

2189
01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:28.251
<v Speaker 2>the genocide.</v>

2190
01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sense of an accelerated sense of </v>

2191
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.290
<v Speaker 2>victimization and then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2192
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:35.340
<v Speaker 2>we get them before they get us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when everyone's being taught now that</v>

2193
01:39:35.341 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 2>they're a victim and then no one seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have any sense that,</v>

2194
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:43.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the essential tragedy of </v>

2195
01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.681
<v Speaker 2>being that life is suffering and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that and that and that and that the </v>

2196
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 2>world rests on a foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

2197
01:39:48.031 --> 01:39:53.031
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing to take personally and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to take responsibility for it </v>

2198
01:39:53.031 --> 01:39:56.811
<v Speaker 2>instead of blaming and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and resentment and all of the things </v>

2199
01:39:56.811 --> 01:39:57.570
<v Speaker 2>that have polluted our universities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture.</v>

2200
01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll also the abandonment of</v>

2201
01:40:00.251 --> 01:40:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2202
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:02.770
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cannon.</v>

2203
01:40:02.771 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people you know,</v>

2204
01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:07.660
<v Speaker 3>asserted that the canon was the product </v>
<v Speaker 3>of bias.</v>

2205
01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:08.350
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the va,</v>

2206
01:40:08.351 --> 01:40:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

2207
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:13.390
<v Speaker 3>have a provincial elitists and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in point of fact,</v>

2208
01:40:13.391 --> 01:40:14.920
<v Speaker 3>as a student of history of the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2209
01:40:14.921 --> 01:40:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can assure people that the canon.</v>

2210
01:40:17.871 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh the overwhelmingly so is,</v>

2211
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:23.170
<v Speaker 3>is the result of what artists have </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined.</v>

2212
01:40:23.171 --> 01:40:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2213
01:40:23.681 --> 01:40:24.370
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2214
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:29.140
<v Speaker 3>we say a work is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's canonical because artists following</v>

2215
01:40:29.141 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2216
01:40:29.741 --> 01:40:34.741
<v Speaker 3>We're influenced by it and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful cascading tradition of </v>

2217
01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:34.780
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>

2218
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's another part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>philistinism okay.</v>

2219
01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Of current education to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2220
01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:43.420
<v Speaker 3>to believe that there are these external</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

2221
01:40:43.421 --> 01:40:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For,</v>

2222
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:49.100
<v Speaker 3>for the why a work last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why a work written 500 years ago or a </v>

2223
01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.610
<v Speaker 3>thousand years ago has global relevance</v>

2224
01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>as if it's some sort of political that's</v>

2225
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:59.100
<v Speaker 3>based on power as if anybody could even </v>
<v Speaker 3>manage that no matter how nefarious </v>

2226
01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.710
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also,</v>

2227
01:41:00.711 --> 01:41:03.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we read in the sixties you had the,</v>

2228
01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.030
<v Speaker 3>had the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2229
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.080
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't like a human human </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensibility that transcendent individual</v>

2230
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:14.910
<v Speaker 3>nations and solid and that and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this like rubric for cosmic </v>

2231
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:16.750
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2232
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:22.070
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sense of the universe as a whole </v>

2233
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:24.930
<v Speaker 3>and just to see the human being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to great eternal principles</v>

2234
01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:27.820
<v Speaker 3>of life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortality and so on.</v>

2235
01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Whereas marxism is blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism is very narrow.</v>

2236
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:34.110
<v Speaker 3>All it sees as a society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2237
01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 3>It says nothing beyond society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem nature.</v>

2238
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean it's absolutely mad.</v>

2239
01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to have a system being </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught,</v>

2240
01:41:42.431 --> 01:41:43.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in universities,</v>

2241
01:41:43.511 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

2242
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

2243
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.060
<v Speaker 3>which thinks that this tiny thing of </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

2244
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compared to the enormity and beauty of </v>

2245
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.070
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2246
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:53.080
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't take all of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our,</v>

2247
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:55.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb all of our energy and attention.</v>

2248
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2249
01:41:56.231 --> 01:41:59.170
<v Speaker 3>I just think that there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>parochialism and provincialism,</v>

2250
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2251
01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:00.960
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2252
01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:02.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now all kinds of,</v>

2253
01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:03.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2254
01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:07.420
<v Speaker 3>systematized elitism in our current </v>
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>

2255
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I just got to be rooted out and I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to return to basics.</v>

2256
01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simplicity's and I have all these </v>

2257
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:16.170
<v Speaker 3>faculty members teaching their little </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny courses that have to,</v>

2258
01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 3>has to do with their own specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to stop.</v>

2259
01:42:18.450 --> 01:42:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can pursue whatever they want in </v>

2260
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.450
<v Speaker 3>their private research scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2261
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Certainly that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they must teach in the core </v>

2262
01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:27.900
<v Speaker 3>curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2263
01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:28.340
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2264
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:33.350
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people must decide what is crucial </v>

2265
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 3>for an educated person to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do want a multicultural.</v>

2266
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I do want a global curriculum like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

2267
01:42:35.921 --> 01:42:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I want all the cultures taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2268
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the answer.</v>

2269
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Martin marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this neo marxism in the university's </v>

2270
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is simply,</v>

2271
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 3>it's lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lazy way to assert </v>

2272
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:52.591
<v Speaker 3>multiculturalism without actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the research and the study of other </v>

2273
01:42:52.591 --> 01:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2274
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2275
01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:58.940
<v Speaker 3>One to close on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We agreed on everything I knew.</v>

2276
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:01.390
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
