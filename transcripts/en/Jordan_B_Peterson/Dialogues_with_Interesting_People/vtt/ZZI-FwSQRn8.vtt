WEBVTT

1
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all for coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:40.921
<v Speaker 1>good evening Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you've just heard,</v>

3
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris met the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time in person two weeks ago now </v>

4
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>in Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They covered an enormous amount of </v>

5
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.511
<v Speaker 1>ground and there is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enormous amount of ground still to </v>

6
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:05.271
<v Speaker 1>cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've asked them if they would start </v>

7
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:09.891
<v Speaker 1>this evening in the following way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all familiar with a straw </v>

8
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>manning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who follows politics,</v>

9
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>no straw manning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've asked them to do the opposite </v>

10
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.411
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start by steel manning the arguments </v>

11
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>of each other to present in the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

12
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most rigorous light,</v>

13
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>what they understand to be the other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument on all of the meat.</v>

14
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Do issues we're about to discuss.</v>

15
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask Sam Harris to go first </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to go from there.</v>

16
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first,</v>

17
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 3>thank you all for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

18
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.921
<v Speaker 3>it's an immense privilege for us to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say many of you have sacrificed</v>

19
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:11.881
<v Speaker 3>a lot to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who have come from other </v>

20
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.561
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm told you all dealt with a ticketing </v>

21
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.560
<v Speaker 3>system that seems like it was run from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cave in Afghanistan.</v>

22
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you all because it's,</v>

24
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing for us to put this date </v>

25
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.121
<v Speaker 3>on the calendar and say we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak here is another for all of you to </v>

26
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 3>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a privilege we certainly </v>

27
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 3>don't take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an immense one.</v>

28
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 3>So Jordan and I should say that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>much of our conversation together.</v>

29
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

30
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 3>We'll often sound like we're debating </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

31
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 3>We will definitely have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of us are in the habit of pulling </v>

32
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.391
<v Speaker 3>our punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an immense amount of goodwill </v>

33
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 3>here and it's true onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true offstage and we're all trying </v>

34
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>to refine our beliefs together in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

35
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.741
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't none of us view this as a </v>

36
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 3>debate though we might stridently </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree about one thing or another.</v>

37
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

38
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 3>So what Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

39
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 3>disagrees with me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he is worried that I thought,</v>

40
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.530
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we clearly have a common project we're </v>

41
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 3>both concerned to understand how to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives worth living.</v>

42
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 3>How can we do this individually and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>can we build societies that safeguard </v>

43
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.170
<v Speaker 3>this project for millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempting to do this and in their </v>

44
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 3>diverse ways and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many questions immediately come </v>

45
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.181
<v Speaker 3>online when you try to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is the relationship between </v>

46
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 3>facts and values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

47
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 3>or science and spiritual experience or </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical lives?</v>

48
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 3>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as for the moment,</v>

49
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:58.830
<v Speaker 3>different answers to those westerns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan is concerned that I,</v>

50
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 3>in my allergy to religion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently value the power of stories </v>

51
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 3>in general and religious stories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

52
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's something more than just </v>

53
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.210
<v Speaker 3>nakedly engaging with facts as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they are,</v>

54
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:20.211
<v Speaker 3>but we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't simply come into contact with </v>

55
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to interpret reality.</v>

56
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 3>We interpreted through our senses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our brands obviously,</v>

57
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>but you need frameworks and as Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

58
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 3>stories with which to do that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get facts in the Ra.</v>

59
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 3>And a Jordan believes that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my purpose so often is to </v>

60
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 3>counter what I view as the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

61
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.951
<v Speaker 3>Most within religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ignore the power and even the </v>

62
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 3>necessity of certain kinds of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

63
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 3>and certain ways of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and,</v>

64
00:04:55.351 --> 00:05:00.351
<v Speaker 3>and our situation in the world that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not only bring many,</v>

65
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 3>many millions or even billions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

66
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 3>immense value are in fact necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone.</v>

67
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>However rational to build a society </v>
<v Speaker 3>where all of our,</v>

68
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wellbeing,</v>

69
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

70
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 3>can be conserved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think if,</v>

71
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>if in brief that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Jordan's concerned about me,</v>

72
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

73
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 4>so sam is concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

74
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I would say above all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the minimization of unnecessary </v>

75
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:39.111
<v Speaker 4>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seems to me to be a pretty good </v>

76
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 4>place to start and he's concerned that</v>

77
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 4>he's concerned that in order to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to develop an ethic.</v>

78
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 4>And that ethic should be grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that realization that unnecessary </v>

79
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 4>suffering is worth contending with and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with.</v>

80
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.200
<v Speaker 4>And that and that if we make too much of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the divide between facts and values,</v>

81
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:11.261
<v Speaker 4>then we end up in a situation where our </v>
<v Speaker 4>value structure has no super subordinate</v>

82
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 4>foundational grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a big problem.</v>

83
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 4>So generally in the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>

84
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 4>it's accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not universally,</v>

85
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 4>that it's difficult if not impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 4>derive value from facts.</v>

86
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.360
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that proposition is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you end up in a situation where </v>

87
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.681
<v Speaker 4>either you lose all your values because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just arbitrary or you or you </v>

88
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 4>have to ground them in something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't,</v>

89
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.990
<v Speaker 4>that that's revelatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Sam is concerned that one of the </v>

90
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.651
<v Speaker 4>negative consequences of grounding your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental ethic in something that's </v>

91
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:51.221
<v Speaker 4>revealed is the emergent consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrational fundamentalism.</v>

92
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 4>And so obviously that's worth contending</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

93
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 4>And so he's taking issue with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical idea that facts and values</v>

94
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 4>have to be separate and formulating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposition that we can in fact ground a</v>

95
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:08.801
<v Speaker 4>universal system of values in the facts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that we can mediate between the </v>

96
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.821
<v Speaker 4>facts and the system of values using </v>
<v Speaker 4>using our facility for truth,</v>

97
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.030
<v Speaker 4>but even more specifically our facility </v>
<v Speaker 4>for rationality and that rationality can</v>

98
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:25.001
<v Speaker 4>be the mediator between the world of </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts in the world and the world of </v>

99
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 4>values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the problem I have with that,</v>

100
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 4>I guess if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can skip briefly to problems,</v>

101
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:35.771
<v Speaker 4>is that it isn't obvious to me how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce an ethos with sufficient </v>

102
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:42.491
<v Speaker 4>motivating power to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ground that conception of the </v>

103
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:47.141
<v Speaker 4>minimization of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say in the promotion of wellbeing in a </v>

104
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:51.311
<v Speaker 4>way that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that grips people in the United States </v>

105
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that's,</v>

106
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.430
<v Speaker 4>that's part of what we're discussing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to sort out with regards to the </v>

107
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.541
<v Speaker 4>potential role of narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious belief as an underpinning to </v>

108
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 4>this ethos.</v>

109
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 4>We seem to agree on the necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universal ethos.</v>

110
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>We even seem to agree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say on what that is because </v>

111
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.741
<v Speaker 4>certainly the minimization of suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to me to be a very good place to </v>

112
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 4>start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We share,</v>

113
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.841
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our concern with and a belief that the </v>

114
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:24.191
<v Speaker 4>pathway to that ethos is in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>related to our ability to speak the </v>

115
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:28.571
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we disagree on what that has to be </v>

116
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 4>grounded in and how it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>grounded.</v>

117
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 4>My sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after thinking about our </v>

118
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.421
<v Speaker 4>discussion is that Sam makes what </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationality is do too much work.</v>

119
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.060
<v Speaker 4>And I'm hoping that not that rationality</v>
<v Speaker 4>is irrelevant or unimportant because it </v>

120
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 4>clearly is neither of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But maybe the devil's in the details and</v>

121
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 4>hopefully we can get down to the details</v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight.</v>

122
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.860
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

123
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

124
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 4>we brought Douglas into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

125
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.490
<v Speaker 4>He's here to serve as much more than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mere moderator and partly we we've </v>

126
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.960
<v Speaker 4>determined that as Sam alluded to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that what we're actually trying to </v>

127
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.490
<v Speaker 4>figure out is what are the minimum </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary preconditions for the </v>

128
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.830
<v Speaker 4>construction of engaged productive </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals with meaningful,</v>

129
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.830
<v Speaker 4>responsible lives in a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stable enough to sustain itself and </v>

130
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 4>dynamic enough to change what are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal preconditions for that?</v>

131
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 4>What are the and how do we ground those </v>
<v Speaker 4>presuppositions,</v>

132
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:31.791
<v Speaker 4>those preconditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what price do we pay for for having </v>

133
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 4>them because you never get something </v>
<v Speaker 4>without a cost.</v>

134
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:37.851
<v Speaker 4>And we thought that Douglas would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>very interesting addition to this </v>

135
00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:41.751
<v Speaker 4>conversation because of course he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrated on such things as borders </v>

136
00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 4>and when you set up preconditions for </v>
<v Speaker 4>social order,</v>

137
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:50.061
<v Speaker 4>you also automatically produced such </v>
<v Speaker 4>things as hierarchies and borders and </v>

138
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:53.990
<v Speaker 4>they don't come without a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we hope to expand the </v>

139
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 4>conversation to include a discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those issues as well.</v>

140
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

141
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Before Douglas Chimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just want to reiterate the fact </v>

142
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.530
<v Speaker 3>that he has not been cast here as our </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderator though.</v>

143
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 3>If Jordan and I run off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expect Douglas to put us back on,</v>

144
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:11.631
<v Speaker 3>and the king's English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not moderate enough to be a </v>

145
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 3>moderator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

146
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

147
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.130
<v Speaker 3>your more moderate than either of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

148
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 3>but so I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to reset the part of your </v>

149
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.081
<v Speaker 3>brain that is poised to begrudge the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderator taken up too much time because</v>

150
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.130
<v Speaker 3>every moderator has felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Bret Weinstein was brilliantly aloof</v>

151
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and uninvolved in much of our exchange </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

152
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:37.861
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doug was really a third participant </v>

153
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:37.861
<v Speaker 3>here and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

154
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:41.101
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stands between Jordan and I on some </v>

155
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 3>issues in a interesting way so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

156
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.590
<v Speaker 3>we have a three way conversation here </v>
<v Speaker 3>where none of us is really sitting in </v>

157
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.640
<v Speaker 3>the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

158
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.340
<v Speaker 1>can I make a quick observation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

159
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.200
<v Speaker 1>some of the progress that you've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>made in Vancouver?</v>

160
00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Some of the Progress I hope we can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight seems to be.</v>

161
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I see one thing that hampers it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me go straight to it with </v>

163
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

164
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I discovered a terrific phrase the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day that our mutual friend,</v>

165
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about the manner in which </v>

166
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 1>you can discuss within the sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain scientific problems.</v>

167
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

168
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a scientist who you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also basically a very literalist </v>

169
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will listen to their argument a </v>

170
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.640
<v Speaker 1>whole long part of the way and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere at the end of it,</v>

171
00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be worried about it.</v>

172
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And he came up with this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this face.</v>

173
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:36.670
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus smuggling,</v>

174
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

175
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus smuggling is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to follow all the way.</v>

176
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

177
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And then the worry is that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bit that you're not so good on,</v>

178
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>that's when they're going to smuggle in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

179
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

180
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>my suspicion is that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservation about some of what Jordan is</v>

181
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:02.341
<v Speaker 1>saying on the substructures on stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and much more because you're worried </v>

182
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.580
<v Speaker 1>that at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either on stage or off it at some point </v>

183
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're not looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

184
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I am looking to Jesus.</v>

185
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Smuggle you.</v>

186
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking maybe I just carry them </v>

188
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:26.450
<v Speaker 1>in on a cross.</v>

189
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't all to apt analogy because </v>

190
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.241
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what worries me and it's but it's.</v>

191
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's more subtle than that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

192
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Just to think that you're consciously </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

193
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Is is a different claim that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>

194
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything insincere</v>
<v Speaker 3>about your argument for the,</v>

195
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.560
<v Speaker 3>for the importance of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

196
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 3>It's also possible we've all met the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who we believe are making the of </v>

197
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 3>arguments and are really there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're consciously putting the rabbit </v>

198
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.450
<v Speaker 3>in the hat and then it pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised when it pops out.</v>

199
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it the analogy that magic is </v>

200
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.231
<v Speaker 3>actually interesting here because we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

201
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.430
<v Speaker 3>We had over dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the,</v>

202
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between real and fake art</v>

203
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 3>and we were talking about this parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this paradox that the art seems to be </v>

204
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.221
<v Speaker 3>incredibly valuable and yet the value </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't located in the object itself or </v>

205
00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:32.501
<v Speaker 3>can't be obviously located there because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a forgery that is a materially the exact</v>

206
00:13:33.561 --> 00:13:37.730
<v Speaker 3>copy of some masterpiece is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthless and the real masterpiece.</v>

207
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Even if it suffered some damage would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly valuable and so where is the </v>

208
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:48.701
<v Speaker 3>value to be located?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it worries me about your enterprise </v>

209
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and the way in which you were you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

210
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 3>You seem to be linking our rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>project and our scientific project with </v>

211
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 3>religion is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is right here.</v>

212
00:13:56.451 --> 00:14:01.451
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between at map </v>

213
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 3>magic as a decent analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between like </v>

214
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.490
<v Speaker 3>paradoxically real magic is fake magic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fake magic is real magic.</v>

215
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 3>The real magic in the world produced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>magicians is the fake magic where the </v>

216
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.250
<v Speaker 3>magician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone like Darren Brown will tell</v>

217
00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:16.910
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually no,</v>

218
00:14:16.911 --> 00:14:21.911
<v Speaker 3>I can't read minds and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did put the rabbit in the hat and if </v>

219
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:21.911
<v Speaker 3>this is fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

220
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:25.950
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the surprise is that even knowing it's </v>

221
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.811
<v Speaker 3>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't understand how this affect is </v>

222
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.451
<v Speaker 3>being achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the fake magicians are the ones </v>

223
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.050
<v Speaker 3>who are pretending to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

224
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 3>who are hiding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are not acknowledging the mechanics,</v>

225
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.000
<v Speaker 3>the real mechanics behind what is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact effective.</v>

226
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

227
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illusion that the rabbit pops out of</v>

228
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:46.040
<v Speaker 3>the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I worry with,</v>

229
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.540
<v Speaker 3>with some of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way in which you discuss the power </v>

230
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.050
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power of metaphor and the religious </v>

231
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.601
<v Speaker 3>anchoring there is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leverage and the utility can be had </v>

232
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 3>even while acknowledging the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanics of it,</v>

233
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fake the fakeness of the magic.</v>

234
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you seem to suspect that it can do </v>

235
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Takes all of the wind out of the sales.</v>

236
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so sure what of it's fake.</v>

237
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:17.800
<v Speaker 5>And what if it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

238
00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 5>let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let,</v>

239
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:23.430
<v Speaker 5>let.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I would say that I do consciously </v>

240
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 5>participate in the process that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>described,</v>

241
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you see,</v>

242
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:31.781
<v Speaker 5>I would also make the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is certainly one of the things </v>

243
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:34.031
<v Speaker 5>that we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been discussing that you do it </v>

244
00:15:34.031 --> 00:15:37.061
<v Speaker 5>unconsciously and let,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me make the case for that from him </v>

245
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:40.420
<v Speaker 5>because I'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been thinking about it a lot and </v>

246
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.131
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to see your response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's what I really read the moral </v>

247
00:15:42.131 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 5>landscape a lot and I thought about it a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot,</v>

248
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so this is what it looks like to me.</v>

249
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.790
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

250
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.920
<v Speaker 5>you make the proposition that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>breach the gap between facts and values </v>

251
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.031
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise our values are left </v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging unmoored and that certainly </v>

252
00:15:58.031 --> 00:16:02.711
<v Speaker 5>brings about the danger of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also a potential danger of swing to </v>

253
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:02.711
<v Speaker 5>totalitarianism.</v>

254
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Something we agree about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

255
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I truly do believe that.</v>

256
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 5>And then you perform an operation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not conceptual operation and you say,</v>

257
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.530
<v Speaker 5>surely we can all agree that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you outline a story about this </v>

258
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.390
<v Speaker 5>woman who lives in this horrible country</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's basically just being starved in </v>

259
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 5>disease ridden and tortured her whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and having just a hell of a time of</v>

260
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 5>it to put it in a phrase and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

261
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 5>well surely we can all agree that that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not good.</v>

262
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 5>And then you contrast that with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in principle,</v>

263
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 5>the sort of life that we would all like </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have.</v>

264
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 5>If we could choose the life that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

265
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 5>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

266
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:40.410
<v Speaker 5>we could start with the proposition that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should move away from this,</v>

267
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 5>this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hellish circumstance and we should move </v>

268
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 5>towards this more ideal perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you say,</v>

269
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 5>if we could only agree on that then and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so and so,</v>

270
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 5>so far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this is,</v>

271
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a couple of things that go along</v>

272
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:01.721
<v Speaker 5>with that that are quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the first is that actually what </v>

273
00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:05.831
<v Speaker 5>you're claiming is that the highest </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral good isn't existing in that better</v>

274
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:11.351
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The highest moral good is acting in the </v>

275
00:17:11.351 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 5>manner that moves us from the hellish </v>
<v Speaker 5>domain to the desirable domain.</v>

276
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.990
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me to be implicit in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

277
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 5>So there's a pattern of behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 5>constitutes the ethic.</v>

278
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say existing in that,</v>

279
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.900
<v Speaker 3>in that better space is good enough as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

280
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the question of what it takes to</v>

281
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:33.841
<v Speaker 3>move from where you are to some place </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and then there's just the </v>

282
00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:34.530
<v Speaker 3>someplace that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's both of them well</v>

283
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we perhaps we could say,</v>

284
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.100
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the ultimate hell?</v>

285
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.820
<v Speaker 5>It might be existing in the hell that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you described,</v>

286
00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:43.920
<v Speaker 5>but it also might be this is something </v>
<v Speaker 5>worse.</v>

287
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:48.921
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that participating in the </v>

288
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 5>process that brings about that hell is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually a,</v>

289
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 5>that's even deeper than the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's an analogous argument.</v>

290
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 5>There's the state of being in a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>

291
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.040
<v Speaker 5>but there's also the state of being that</v>
<v Speaker 5>brings you to that good state and then </v>

292
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.281
<v Speaker 5>there's the state of being that's in a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a terrible state and the process </v>

293
00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:07.611
<v Speaker 5>that brings you to that terrible state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that I've learned </v>

294
00:18:07.611 --> 00:18:12.410
<v Speaker 5>from the architectural and religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>texts that I've studied as well as the </v>

295
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.071
<v Speaker 5>philosophical texts is that the process </v>
<v Speaker 5>that transforms society into something </v>

296
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 5>approximating hell is a lower hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the reasonable.</v>

297
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.980
<v Speaker 6>Let me just close the loop on that </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm pretty sure I disagree.</v>

298
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.730
<v Speaker 6>You can imagine to counterexamples one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as you could imagine,</v>

299
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:32.731
<v Speaker 6>a statistic being a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might even call him God,</v>

300
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.720
<v Speaker 6>who would create a circumstance of hell </v>
<v Speaker 6>and populate it with innocent souls.</v>

301
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 6>Right now that's presumably that action </v>
<v Speaker 6>need not be attended by a lot of </v>

302
00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 6>suffering or you could imagine.</v>

303
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's still.</v>

304
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.410
<v Speaker 5>It's still wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally wrong.</v>

305
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could even imagine someone who </v>

306
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Speaker 5>enjoys generating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

307
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.240
<v Speaker 5>it could be a source of even more wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>than not enjoy it.</v>

308
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

309
00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 5>So we want to separate out two things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want to separate out these states of </v>

310
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.940
<v Speaker 5>being and the process that brings them </v>
<v Speaker 5>into being,</v>

311
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.950
<v Speaker 5>and I do believe you do that in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>work because basically what you suggest </v>

312
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.451
<v Speaker 5>is that the appropriate way to act </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethically is to act in a manner that </v>

313
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.800
<v Speaker 5>moves us away from hell and moves us </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards a desirable state.</v>

314
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is is that as far as I'm </v>

315
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 5>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of things about that.</v>

316
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.820
<v Speaker 5>The first thing is that I wouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that mode of acting is a fact.</v>

317
00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:27.041
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's a personality and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're suggesting is that people </v>

318
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:30.230
<v Speaker 5>embodied the personality that Moves </v>
<v Speaker 5>Society Way from hell towards heaven for</v>

319
00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:31.280
<v Speaker 5>lack of a better term.</v>

320
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:36.490
<v Speaker 5>And the reason terms and the reason I </v>
<v Speaker 5>make that argument is because I think </v>

321
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.780
<v Speaker 5>that you recapitulate the essential </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian message precisely by doing </v>

322
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 5>that because symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least as far as I can understand,</v>

323
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 5>stripped of its religious con of it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphysical context.</v>

324
00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that the purpose of positing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

325
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vision of the ideal human being,</v>

326
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.700
<v Speaker 5>which independent of the metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>

327
00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 5>it certainly what the symbol of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 5>represents is the mode of being that </v>

328
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.871
<v Speaker 5>moves us most effectively from something</v>
<v Speaker 5>approximating held to something </v>

329
00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:10.280
<v Speaker 5>approximating heaven and then part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that part of that message is,</v>

330
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.670
<v Speaker 5>and this is also something that's dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>along the lines of what you're arguing,</v>

331
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:17.420
<v Speaker 5>is that the best way to embody that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually to live in truth.</v>

332
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean so because I would say that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamental Christian ethic,</v>

333
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.760
<v Speaker 5>metaphysics accepted once again is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>act in love,</v>

334
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:30.761
<v Speaker 5>which is to assume that being is </v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptable and can be perfected and to </v>

335
00:20:30.761 --> 00:20:33.230
<v Speaker 5>pursue that with truth and that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>should embody that.</v>

336
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.350
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say that the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the representation we could call the </v>

337
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.860
<v Speaker 5>mega fictions are archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations,</v>

338
00:20:39.861 --> 00:20:44.861
<v Speaker 5>is to show that in embodied format so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it can be imitated rather than to </v>

339
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 5>transform into something that's diluted </v>
<v Speaker 5>in some sense to to an abstract </v>

340
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.771
<v Speaker 5>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't think the abstract </v>

341
00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 5>rationality in itself has enough flesh </v>
<v Speaker 5>on it so to speak.</v>

342
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 5>Which is partly why in the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethic,</v>

343
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:04.621
<v Speaker 5>there's an emphasis that the word which </v>
<v Speaker 5>is something roughly akin to </v>

344
00:21:04.621 --> 00:21:04.621
<v Speaker 5>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to make,</v>

345
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 5>has to be made flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to be enacted,</v>

346
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:12.230
<v Speaker 6>but is the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is the flesh made of dogmatism and </v>

347
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.300
<v Speaker 6>superstition and other worldliness?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that part of what gives it its shape </v>

348
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.251
<v Speaker 6>and necessity?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think traditionally historically it </v>

349
00:21:22.251 --> 00:21:25.161
<v Speaker 6>has been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's been the problem with </v>

350
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:25.161
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

351
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:28.731
<v Speaker 6>if you denude it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of everything that is unjustifiable and </v>

352
00:21:28.731 --> 00:21:30.660
<v Speaker 6>the light of 21st century science and </v>
<v Speaker 6>rationality,</v>

353
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.260
<v Speaker 6>I think what you have to get down to is </v>
<v Speaker 6>something quite a bit more universal and</v>

354
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.880
<v Speaker 6>less provincial than any specific </v>
<v Speaker 6>religion and Christianity per se.</v>

355
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.300
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting too though,</v>

356
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the.</v>

357
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 5>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the points that you do make is </v>

358
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.141
<v Speaker 5>that you do appeal to or assume the </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence of a transcendental internal </v>

359
00:21:58.041 --> 00:21:59.210
<v Speaker 5>ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>

360
00:21:59.211 --> 00:22:00.620
<v Speaker 5>Which I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

361
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.790
<v Speaker 5>since we're going down this direction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems to me to be something very akin to</v>

362
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:09.791
<v Speaker 5>the idea of the Holy Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is something like the internal </v>

363
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.690
<v Speaker 5>representation of a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>universal ethic.</v>

364
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 5>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to strip these concepts of </v>

365
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.181
<v Speaker 5>their metaphysical substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making a case at the moment for </v>

366
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:19.820
<v Speaker 5>the existence of the great man in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sky.</v>

367
00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:21.200
<v Speaker 5>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can get to that later.</v>

368
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying that what seems to be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>case is that we have underneath our </v>

369
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.061
<v Speaker 5>cognitive architecture and our social </v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture a layer of symbolic and </v>

370
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:34.991
<v Speaker 5>dramatic narrative representation that </v>
<v Speaker 5>instantiates the same concepts but but </v>

371
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.360
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

372
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.720
<v Speaker 5>in a multidimensional context.</v>

373
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.870
<v Speaker 5>One of the things we talked about in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vancouver for example,</v>

374
00:22:41.871 --> 00:22:46.871
<v Speaker 5>is that the religious enterprise doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>only emphasize rationality it.</v>

375
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.620
<v Speaker 5>It brings music into the play and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>brings art into the play and it brings </v>

376
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.181
<v Speaker 5>drama and it brings literature and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>brings architecture and it brings the </v>

377
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.390
<v Speaker 5>organizing of of cities around a central</v>
<v Speaker 5>space like it.</v>

378
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.580
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pushing itself.</v>

379
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 5>It's manifesting itself across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimensions of human existence </v>

380
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.421
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to me that gives it a richness that </v>

381
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:16.760
<v Speaker 5>cannot be diluted without loss and and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also a motive power that,</v>

382
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.600
<v Speaker 5>that appear appeal to rationality I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think can manage,</v>

383
00:23:20.601 --> 00:23:25.601
<v Speaker 5>and this is c,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things and this is maybe a </v>

384
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:25.601
<v Speaker 5>good place for Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>delete B and c,</v>

385
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:25.730
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that Douglas,</v>

386
00:23:25.731 --> 00:23:30.731
<v Speaker 5>who's claimed upon multiple locations to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be an atheist and I don't know how he's </v>

387
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 5>feeling about that and at the present </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

388
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.970
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter if one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

389
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 5>One of the things Doug Douglas has has </v>
<v Speaker 5>pointed out was that there are things </v>

390
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.610
<v Speaker 5>that we've done in free countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say broadly speaking in the West </v>

391
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 5>that are worth protecting</v>

392
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 7>and that in order to protect them in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>longest sense,</v>

393
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.250
<v Speaker 7>it's conceivable that we need a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>

394
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.350
<v Speaker 7>a cognitive structure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Something like that that can act as a </v>

395
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 7>bulwark against those forces that would </v>
<v Speaker 7>seek to undermine and destroy it.</v>

396
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 7>And Douglas has been driven,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say to some degree,</v>

397
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<v Speaker 7>to hypothesize that for Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for all its faults,</v>

398
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.990
<v Speaker 7>or we could say Judeo Christianity to </v>
<v Speaker 7>broaden it for all its faults might </v>

399
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.501
<v Speaker 7>provide something approximating that </v>
<v Speaker 7>bowl work if we could only figure out </v>

400
00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 7>how to utilize it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

401
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:24.520
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

402
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of my problems on this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it seems that we are where we are </v>

403
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.480
<v Speaker 1>with belief in whether we wish it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

404
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.680
<v Speaker 1>We cannot believe as our predecessors </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed,</v>

405
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.480
<v Speaker 1>even if we wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know too much more now and it puts us</v>

406
00:24:48.481 --> 00:24:53.481
<v Speaker 1>in this very difficult position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to denude also as if the entire </v>

407
00:24:54.631 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>story seems to me to be a fool's errand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the set of reasons.</v>

408
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.250
<v Speaker 1>One of which is that from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>

409
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:05.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of speaking to people from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the well,</v>

410
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem at all obvious to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we have in countries like this</v>

411
00:25:09.751 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>one is the default position of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

412
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's likes me as being very rare order,</v>

413
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 1>even political order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political liberalism,</v>

414
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 1>political freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

415
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:29.861
<v Speaker 1>very unusual things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you like the things that helped </v>

416
00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 1>to get through that with all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>caveats,</v>

417
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Speaker 1>with all the caveats we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could fau in all evening and it's not</v>

418
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that got us there </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

419
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 1>But if you'd like broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are,</v>

420
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be very suspicious at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very least of saying the whole story is </v>

421
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 1>no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need the story.</v>

422
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>We can move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quote,</v>

423
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite often the radical theologian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Cupitt,</v>

424
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>who was often described as an atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>priest and cupid.</v>

425
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>So somewhere in a recent book he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.000
<v Speaker 1>we can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

427
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:09.070
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dreams that we dream is still </v>

428
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Christian dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether we like that fact or not,</v>

429
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and without being able to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

430
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean not being able to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal believer?</v>

431
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worry about what happens when the </v>

432
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 1>square is denuded completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why this discussion tonight </v>

433
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 1>and Youtube in particular are right on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cusp of this because this is.</v>

434
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.600
<v Speaker 1>This is where I think a lot of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if we really wanted to believe,</v>

435
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 1>we basically can't apply that we very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

436
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think there's an additional</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to refine my previous point to use </v>

437
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.721
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's this additional </v>

438
00:26:50.721 --> 00:26:52.791
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a fear which you may </v>

439
00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:52.791
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also have,</v>

440
00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 1>which is if there's a risk that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've just said,</v>

441
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>nevermind what Jordan has also say </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a risk.</v>

442
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:04.161
<v Speaker 1>I think some people feel that your going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to soften up the somehow and that even </v>

443
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 1>if neither Jordan nor I are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly start Jesus smuggling,</v>

444
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 1>we might create the conditions that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it easier for someone else to do that.</v>

445
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a fair?</v>

446
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it it.</v>

447
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.700
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

448
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.410
<v Speaker 8>No photos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's very frustrating,</v>

449
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.740
<v Speaker 8>so thank you.</v>

450
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I can sharpen up what my </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern actually is here because it's </v>

451
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.311
<v Speaker 3>not even true to say that I think you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to get rid of the Jesus story or </v>

452
00:27:43.311 --> 00:27:48.111
<v Speaker 3>even or even not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

453
00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think there's something </v>

454
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 3>problematic with orienting your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the Jesus Story.</v>

455
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I think that that can be reclaimed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so for instance,</v>

456
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I was walking yesterday in this fine </v>
<v Speaker 3>city of yours and saw someone on the </v>

457
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.551
<v Speaker 3>sidewalk giving Taro readings to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had with a Taro deck spread out.</v>

458
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>He had a few cards spread out and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>soliciting people.</v>

459
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

460
00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:12.500
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

461
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to say I didn't sit for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading,</v>

462
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 3>but to Tarot cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're familiar with them,</v>

463
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.230
<v Speaker 3>are the quintessential artifact of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>age woo,</v>

464
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:23.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

465
00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:28.661
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are not thought of as legitimate </v>

466
00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:31.581
<v Speaker 3>tools of divination except by people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that they're legitimate tools of </v>

467
00:28:31.581 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 3>divination.</v>

468
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 3>And yet a tarot reading can be truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>

469
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

470
00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 3>this is built on something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

471
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:45.190
<v Speaker 3>This is not just a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

472
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.360
<v Speaker 3>example of self deception on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people reading and people getting their </v>

473
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.930
<v Speaker 3>cards read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These cards can seem pressured.</v>

474
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I could give you all are reading right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and 95 percent of you would find </v>

475
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:05.391
<v Speaker 3>what I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the cards would say to be relevant </v>

476
00:29:05.391 --> 00:29:05.391
<v Speaker 3>to your lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

477
00:29:05.391 --> 00:29:09.591
<v Speaker 3>I could do it with an imaginary deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even I in invisible imaginary </v>

478
00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 3>deck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about Tarot cards,</v>

479
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:14.721
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to turn over to cards now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is the son and the other is the </v>

480
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.030
<v Speaker 3>fallen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know so little about Taro than I'm</v>

481
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:23.031
<v Speaker 3>not even sure the fallen man is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible part or I think it was the </v>

482
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:23.150
<v Speaker 3>hanged man isn't terrible.</v>

483
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've got these two cards and you know</v>

484
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 3>the sun is clearly the representation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom,</v>

485
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:30.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the and the.</v>

486
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 3>The hanged man is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of,</v>

487
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:39.441
<v Speaker 3>of lost opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you with some degree of </v>

488
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:42.951
<v Speaker 3>certainty that all of you are at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossroads in your life where you have,</v>

489
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:48.391
<v Speaker 3>you have good reason to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not making the most of your </v>

490
00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:52.321
<v Speaker 3>opportunities right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go on like this for an hour and </v>

491
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 3>pretend all the wild that it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do with the car.</v>

492
00:29:57.221 --> 00:30:02.221
<v Speaker 3>It's actually been working in concert </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the dynamics of the cosmos such </v>

493
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 3>that these cards that I turn over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were they real,</v>

494
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 3>would be the ones that Dave of </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>

495
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:14.791
<v Speaker 3>When revealing something about your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this moment and obviously people </v>

496
00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:18.661
<v Speaker 3>think in these terms about astrology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic magic and all the rest and </v>

497
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 3>religion is built upon this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>superstition,</v>

498
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:27.210
<v Speaker 3>there is a way of understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility of using a device like this and </v>

499
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:33.211
<v Speaker 3>the real effect it has on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I turn over the cards and ask </v>

500
00:30:33.211 --> 00:30:37.081
<v Speaker 3>you to look at your life in this moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>as though for the first time through </v>

501
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:41.371
<v Speaker 3>this lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering in this case lost </v>

502
00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:41.371
<v Speaker 3>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

503
00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's going to be valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make.</v>

504
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 3>It could be an incredibly useful thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

505
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.940
<v Speaker 3>The My.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My main concern is that at no point you </v>

506
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 3>have to lie to yourself about your state</v>
<v Speaker 3>of knowledge about the mechanism,</v>

507
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to believe Taro cards </v>

508
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.830
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

509
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.890
<v Speaker 5>There's deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deeper mechanisms at work with someone </v>

510
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.560
<v Speaker 5>who's actually good at that and so I </v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with what you said,</v>

511
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.940
<v Speaker 3>but they need not be super nice.</v>

512
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they are supernatural and </v>

513
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.891
<v Speaker 5>in fact I think what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>use a projective technique like that </v>

514
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:18.311
<v Speaker 5>because that's essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm good at interpersonal attunement </v>

515
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:21.080
<v Speaker 5>and I'm quite intuitive what I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do this and everyone does this in the</v>

516
00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:23.750
<v Speaker 5>course of a dialogue that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>working well,</v>

517
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to flip over the cards and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to start with generic archetipal </v>

518
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.611
<v Speaker 5>statements that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are true in some sense for </v>

519
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:36.341
<v Speaker 5>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I'm going to watch you both </v>

520
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:38.651
<v Speaker 5>consciously and implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unconsciously with all of my social </v>

521
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:40.040
<v Speaker 5>intelligence and I'm going to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>through very,</v>

522
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 5>very subtle signs on your part when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>respond positively to what I'm saying </v>

523
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:49.370
<v Speaker 5>and when you respond negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to continue down the lines</v>

524
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.560
<v Speaker 5>that you established by your positive </v>
<v Speaker 5>responses.</v>

525
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Brown does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a mentalist,</v>

526
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

527
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's exactly what happens when children </v>

528
00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:58.920
<v Speaker 5>are interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

529
00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 5>by people who lead them as witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

530
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:04.051
<v Speaker 5>The children infer from the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 5>expressions of the person who's </v>

531
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 5>interrogating them what it is that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually want to hear,</v>

532
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 5>and so they'll have even worked with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that horse.</v>

533
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Clever Hans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

534
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

535
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Even horses can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so carol card readers can definitely do </v>

536
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:15.980
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

537
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.470
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

538
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.590
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the mechanisms behind something like </v>

539
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.871
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it appears entirely </v>

540
00:32:24.871 --> 00:32:26.371
<v Speaker 5>superstitious on the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are often deeper than it is revealed at </v>

541
00:32:26.371 --> 00:32:26.371
<v Speaker 5>first approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

542
00:32:26.371 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 5>and I wanted to talk a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't mind,</v>

543
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Speaker 5>for a minute about rationality because</v>

544
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

545
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.220
<v Speaker 5>we've already agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think definitely stop me if I'm wrong,</v>

546
00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:43.221
<v Speaker 5>that there has to be an intermediary </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism between the world of facts in </v>

547
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 5>the world of values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And well,</v>

548
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:49.570
<v Speaker 5>since we've talked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been reading a variety of </v>

549
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.181
<v Speaker 5>commentaries on Emmanuel Kant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mostly these are been written by Roger </v>

550
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 5>Scruton by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is actually the issue that they</v>

551
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.760
<v Speaker 5>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

552
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.130
<v Speaker 5>what obsessed about for most of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical life.</v>

553
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:06.131
<v Speaker 5>And what he concluded was that </v>
<v Speaker 5>empiricism can't be right in </v>

554
00:33:06.131 --> 00:33:10.001
<v Speaker 5>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't be right as philosophical </v>

555
00:33:10.001 --> 00:33:12.371
<v Speaker 5>disciplines because you need an </v>
<v Speaker 5>intermediary structure that we have an </v>

556
00:33:12.371 --> 00:33:16.061
<v Speaker 5>inbuilt intermediary structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that structure is what mediates </v>

557
00:33:16.061 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 5>between the thing in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world of facts,</v>

558
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the outputs,</v>

559
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 5>the values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I was thinking</v>

560
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.930
<v Speaker 3>the truth is we don't quite agree on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this in my summary of your view of me.</v>

561
00:33:25.931 --> 00:33:30.931
<v Speaker 3>I would have agreed with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me it's just facts all the way </v>

562
00:33:30.931 --> 00:33:30.931
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One cares.</v>

563
00:33:30.931 --> 00:33:32.500
<v Speaker 3>You're great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're describing glad.</v>

564
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:33.850
<v Speaker 3>Glad to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

565
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need a brain then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

566
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.120
<v Speaker 3>but brandon is yet another part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

567
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 3>And what I mean by a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do anything there.</v>

568
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:48.000
<v Speaker 5>What does the brain do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to do something because otherwise</v>

569
00:33:48.001 --> 00:33:48.840
<v Speaker 5>you don't need it.</v>

570
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does a lot.</v>

571
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

572
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 3>so your concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it to jump to the other,</v>

573
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 3>where I think we're going in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is how is it that values </v>

574
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 3>can be another order of fact that seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic to you.</v>

575
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>It seems problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's problematic to David Hume.</v>

576
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's problematic for me for technical </v>

577
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

578
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.420
<v Speaker 5>which is that in order to app and we see</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we agree on this in order to perceive</v>

579
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:25.170
<v Speaker 5>and to act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I believe are both acts of value,</v>

580
00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.010
<v Speaker 5>to perceive as an active value because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to look at something instead of</v>

581
00:34:30.011 --> 00:34:35.011
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have you elevate the thing that </v>

582
00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 5>you're perceiving to the position of </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest value by perceiving it,</v>

583
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.130
<v Speaker 5>by deciding to perceive it.</v>

584
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gets translated in my brain into </v>

585
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.050
<v Speaker 3>just more facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just giving me the facts of human</v>

586
00:34:46.051 --> 00:34:48.000
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

587
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's no problem.</v>

588
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm perfectly happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then in order to act,</v>

589
00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Speaker 5>you have to select the target of action </v>
<v Speaker 5>from among an infinite number near </v>

590
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.921
<v Speaker 5>infinite number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>close enough of possible mechanisms of </v>

591
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:05.911
<v Speaker 5>action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what a biological organism does </v>

592
00:35:05.911 --> 00:35:08.080
<v Speaker 5>is take the facts and translate them </v>
<v Speaker 5>into perception and action.</v>

593
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:13.470
<v Speaker 5>And the only organisms that do that with</v>
<v Speaker 5>one to one mapping are organisms that </v>

594
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.860
<v Speaker 5>are composed of sensory motor cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sponges,</v>

595
00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:22.861
<v Speaker 5>marine sponges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are composed of sensory motor </v>

596
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:24.961
<v Speaker 5>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have an intermediary nervous </v>

597
00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:24.961
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what they do is they sit in the water</v>

598
00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:29.521
<v Speaker 5>and they make a sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so simple that if you grind a </v>

599
00:35:29.521 --> 00:35:29.680
<v Speaker 5>sponge through a sieve and in salt </v>
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>

600
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.070
<v Speaker 5>it'll reorganize itself into the sponge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's quite cool.</v>

601
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.960
<v Speaker 5>The sponge sits in the water.</v>

602
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it does,</v>

603
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

604
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 5>it does is it there's waves on it and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

605
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Those are patterns and then the sponge </v>
<v Speaker 5>opens and closes,</v>

606
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 5>pours on its surface in response to </v>
<v Speaker 5>those patterns.</v>

607
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:53.121
<v Speaker 5>So it maps the pattern of the waves </v>
<v Speaker 5>right onto its behavior with no </v>

608
00:35:53.121 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 5>intermediary of a nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it can only map waves.</v>

609
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 5>That's all it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it can only open and close pores.</v>

610
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:04.190
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it does one to one factor value </v>

611
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 5>mapping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what happens is that as the,</v>

612
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 5>as the complexity of a biological </v>
<v Speaker 5>organism increases,</v>

613
00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 5>two things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first thing that happens is that the</v>

614
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:16.521
<v Speaker 5>sensory and motor cells differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now the organism has sensory cells </v>

615
00:36:16.521 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 5>and motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So since senses to detect and census,</v>

616
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cells to detect and cells to act.</v>

617
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.380
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then it can do,</v>

618
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:30.410
<v Speaker 5>it can detect more patterns because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>more sophisticated at the sensory port </v>

619
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.950
<v Speaker 5>perspective and it could do more things </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it has specialized motor </v>

620
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.610
<v Speaker 5>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then what happens is that as it gets</v>

621
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:40.611
<v Speaker 5>even more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it puts an intermediary structure </v>

622
00:36:40.611 --> 00:36:44.211
<v Speaker 5>of nervous tissue in there and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure increases in the number of </v>

623
00:36:44.211 --> 00:36:44.211
<v Speaker 5>layers of neurons.</v>

624
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.280
<v Speaker 5>And what that means is that as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 5>that happens and as the sensory cells </v>

625
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 5>become more specialized and as the motor</v>
<v Speaker 5>output cells become more specialized,</v>

626
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.490
<v Speaker 5>many more patterns can be detected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are roughly equivalent to facts </v>

627
00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 5>and many more motor outputs can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>manifested,</v>

628
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:06.110
<v Speaker 5>but a tremendous number of calculations </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to has to occur in that </v>

629
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.371
<v Speaker 5>intermediary nervous tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the structure that I'm </v>

630
00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:13.521
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That structure exists and it translates </v>

631
00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:16.731
<v Speaker 5>the patterns into motor output and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do it on a one to one basis </v>

632
00:37:16.731 --> 00:37:17.880
<v Speaker 5>because there are more patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more facts.</v>

633
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 5>Then there are motor outputs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what has to happen is this tremendous</v>

634
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:27.051
<v Speaker 5>plethora of facts that surrounds us has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be filtered to the point where you </v>

635
00:37:27.051 --> 00:37:29.200
<v Speaker 5>pick a single action because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>act,</v>

636
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.250
<v Speaker 5>act otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so the mechanism that reduces the </v>

637
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:37.671
<v Speaker 5>number of facts to the selected action </v>
<v Speaker 5>is the mechanism that mediates between </v>

638
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 5>facts and values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not simply in and of itself.</v>

639
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:46.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a fact that that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it isn't a simple that what it does </v>

640
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 5>isn't the simple fact you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't explain it.</v>

641
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.550
<v Speaker 5>You can't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

642
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the same reason that you can't look </v>

643
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.590
<v Speaker 5>for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the same reason that you don't know </v>

644
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.651
<v Speaker 5>what a neural network is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can train a neural network and </v>

645
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:03.651
<v Speaker 5>network.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's</v>

646
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:08.100
<v Speaker 3>a distinction between facts and facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know right there.</v>

647
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.450
<v Speaker 3>There is whatever it is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

648
00:38:10.451 --> 00:38:13.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's our understanding of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our misunderstanding of it.</v>

649
00:38:13.211 --> 00:38:17.140
<v Speaker 3>So there are many things that we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that we're wrong about.</v>

650
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:22.030
<v Speaker 3>There are many things that we are aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're ignorant of and there's this,</v>

651
00:38:22.031 --> 00:38:27.031
<v Speaker 3>there's this larger always this larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>space of reality that we're struggling </v>

652
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:31.120
<v Speaker 3>to engage with and it may in fact be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case that in evolutionary terms,</v>

653
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>but we know it's the case that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have not evolved to understand large </v>

654
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the sort of monkeys we are.</v>

655
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could even argue that one,</v>

656
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.950
<v Speaker 3>one cognitive scientist who some of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>may have heard of Donald Hoffman is </v>

657
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.211
<v Speaker 3>arguing now know very colorfully that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human consciousness or the human mind </v>

658
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.790
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually evolved to get things wrong </v>

659
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.991
<v Speaker 3>in a fairly specific ways so that so as </v>
<v Speaker 3>to maximize survival.</v>

660
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>And that was the argument I made in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>first discussion.</v>

661
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

662
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:10.621
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here was not quite because there's </v>

663
00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:13.891
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This still preserves the difference </v>

664
00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:13.891
<v Speaker 3>between getting things right and getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>things wrong.</v>

665
00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:13.891
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

666
00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 3>his argument is that getting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>truly right,</v>

667
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:21.511
<v Speaker 3>having a nervous system and a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture that could really </v>

668
00:39:21.511 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 3>understand reality quote reality as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

669
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:29.850
<v Speaker 3>would be maladaptive and he has some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has some mathematical demonstration </v>

670
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 3>of this that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

671
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

672
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 3>the true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quote,</v>

673
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:38.581
<v Speaker 3>true representations of reality are </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorically maladaptive and you had </v>

674
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.870
<v Speaker 3>that there's certain kind of error that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

675
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I buy this argument,</v>

676
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that you can make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

677
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:49.681
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you can differentiate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptively useful misunderstandings </v>

678
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 3>versus a true understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's maladaptive.</v>

679
00:39:56.171 --> 00:40:01.171
<v Speaker 3>The fact that we can even talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that demonstrates to me that we have </v>

680
00:40:01.171 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 3>this larger picture of what is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>true whether we know it or not,</v>

681
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.860
<v Speaker 3>and this is what this is what religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>get so catastrophic.</v>

682
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 3>The wrong religion gives you some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism whereby,</v>

683
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.620
<v Speaker 3>whereby to Orient Yourself in this case </v>
<v Speaker 3>revelation,</v>

684
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.840
<v Speaker 7>does religion does provide those,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those functional simplifications</v>

685
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.650
<v Speaker 3>actually a similar purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are simplifications appropriate to</v>

686
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:29.310
<v Speaker 3>the Iron Age?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

687
00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.470
<v Speaker 3>some of that,</v>

688
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:35.990
<v Speaker 7>some of them are for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's why we have to have this </v>

689
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.290
<v Speaker 7>discussion because,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because mirror,</v>

690
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.930
<v Speaker 7>mirror revelation in mere tradition is </v>
<v Speaker 7>insufficient.</v>

691
00:40:38.931 --> 00:40:43.931
<v Speaker 7>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I truly believe that we can agree on </v>

692
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:46.121
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But back to the back to the biological </v>

693
00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:46.121
<v Speaker 7>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

694
00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:49.790
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I thought that tonight I would </v>

695
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 7>make a very strictly biological argument</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that so now the question is now,</v>

696
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.320
<v Speaker 7>so now you've got your sensory systems </v>
<v Speaker 7>that are detecting the world of facts </v>

697
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.531
<v Speaker 7>and you have your motor output system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a very narrow channel because </v>

698
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:02.321
<v Speaker 7>you can only do one thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's one of the things about </v>

699
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:02.720
<v Speaker 7>consciousness that's quite strange.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very,</v>

700
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:07.721
<v Speaker 7>very narrow channel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you have to take this unbelievably </v>

701
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:10.211
<v Speaker 7>complex world and you have to channel it</v>
<v Speaker 7>into this very narrow channel and you,</v>

702
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.770
<v Speaker 7>you don't do that by being wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world,</v>

703
00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:17.771
<v Speaker 7>but you do do that by ignoring a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world and by using representations </v>

704
00:41:17.771 --> 00:41:22.181
<v Speaker 7>that are no more complicated than they </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to be in order to attain the task </v>

705
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:22.181
<v Speaker 7>at hand.</v>

706
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.520
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're losing using low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution representations of the world.</v>

707
00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 7>They're not inaccurate because a low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution representations of the world </v>

708
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.180
<v Speaker 7>isn't inaccurate any more than a low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution photo is.</v>

709
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 7>But there are no resolution than they </v>
<v Speaker 7>need to be in order for you to undertake</v>

710
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:40.661
<v Speaker 7>the task at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you undertake the task at hand </v>

711
00:41:40.661 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 7>and that goes successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then what you've done,</v>

712
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 7>and this is basically the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 7>American pragmatism,</v>

713
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:48.700
<v Speaker 7>what you've done is validated the you've</v>
<v Speaker 7>validated the validity of your </v>

714
00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.170
<v Speaker 7>simplifications.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if the tool you have in hand is good,</v>

715
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 7>if the ax you have in hand is sharp </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough to chop down the tree,</v>

716
00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:00.190
<v Speaker 7>that it's a good enough acts and that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>part of the way that we define truth </v>

717
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.970
<v Speaker 7>pragmatically in the absence of infinite</v>
<v Speaker 7>knowledge about everything.</v>

718
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.360
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now you build up this nervous system </v>

719
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:07.360
<v Speaker 7>between the world of facts and the world</v>
<v Speaker 7>of values and it,</v>

720
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 7>and it narrows the world of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the question then is how do you </v>

721
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 7>generate the mechanism that does that </v>
<v Speaker 7>narrowing?</v>

722
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.220
<v Speaker 7>And this is what's useful.</v>

723
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.970
<v Speaker 3>That's not quite how the cake is </v>
<v Speaker 3>layered.</v>

724
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 3>What the facts are up here to write </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

725
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:25.450
<v Speaker 3>For me to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to even notice that you're a </v>

726
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.450
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

727
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Or to attribute beliefs to you or to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a sense of being in relationship at</v>

728
00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:32.981
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of those higher order </v>

729
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 3>interpretive acts based on a many </v>
<v Speaker 3>layered nervous system.</v>

730
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only bought them up yet,</v>

731
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bottom up and top down.</v>

732
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fat.</v>

733
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 3>But facts are also on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

734
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not that we have facts here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>values here.</v>

735
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

736
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.750
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what I'm trying to do,</v>

737
00:42:49.751 --> 00:42:52.440
<v Speaker 5>I can't get to a fag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but through going to do.</v>

738
00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:54.850
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

739
00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:59.851
<v Speaker 5>just that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are using your positing that we can </v>

740
00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:02.280
<v Speaker 5>use rationality as a mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 5>mediating between facts and values,</v>

741
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.010
<v Speaker 5>I believe because otherwise there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>use for rationality.</v>

742
00:43:05.011 --> 00:43:06.030
<v Speaker 5>We can just have the facts.</v>

743
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's a process even simpler than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

744
00:43:08.131 --> 00:43:11.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just that for me and I think for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

745
00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:14.640
<v Speaker 3>if they will only agree to use language </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this way.</v>

746
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:20.390
<v Speaker 3>For me values are simply facts about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of conscious creatures.</v>

747
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Good at that experiences give us our </v>
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>

748
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not simple,</v>

749
00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 5>but at there are the goods in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>summer.</v>

750
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have in your hand,</v>

751
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.810
<v Speaker 3>put it on a hot stove is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple and you'll notice it'll save your</v>

752
00:43:34.811 --> 00:43:37.460
<v Speaker 3>child if you do it well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

753
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.580
<v Speaker 3>the unpleasantness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's an orthogonal.</v>

754
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:43.710
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

755
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

756
00:43:44.281 --> 00:43:47.400
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the way the reward and </v>
<v Speaker 5>punishment systems work in the brain,</v>

757
00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:50.820
<v Speaker 5>you can easily train an animal using </v>
<v Speaker 5>reward to wag its tail.</v>

758
00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:54.210
<v Speaker 5>If it's being shocked electrically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do that and you can wire it very</v>

759
00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 5>loaded.</v>

760
00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.140
<v Speaker 3>There's a range of unpleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences we can have where we can </v>

761
00:44:00.211 --> 00:44:02.670
<v Speaker 3>construe them as pleasant or </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary.</v>

762
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a kind of a higher level of </v>

763
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:07.890
<v Speaker 3>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm talking about,</v>

764
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst possible sensory experience </v>

765
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.010
<v Speaker 3>that all of us will agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll agree is unpleasant,</v>

766
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:19.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't require a story too for us </v>

767
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 3>to feel a version two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

768
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:25.030
<v Speaker 3>there are many things like that in life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just just rudimentary where </v>

769
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.190
<v Speaker 3>it's just we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are organized in such a way that</v>

770
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.690
<v Speaker 5>put put us into fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't like it.</v>

771
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.790
<v Speaker 5>So are you clear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you claiming then like this is </v>

772
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.531
<v Speaker 5>another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where I think that the argument </v>

773
00:44:36.531 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 5>that you make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although accurate in its rudiments,</v>

774
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:44.091
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is insufficiently high resolution </v>

775
00:44:44.091 --> 00:44:46.251
<v Speaker 5>because now it sounds to me like you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>including the domain of quality </v>

776
00:44:46.251 --> 00:44:48.680
<v Speaker 5>unquestioningly in the domain of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you can do that,</v>

777
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 5>but we need to know if that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing.</v>

778
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 5>Like what are these facts you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about?</v>

779
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:57.591
<v Speaker 5>Are they mirrored manifestations of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>objective world or do they shade into </v>

780
00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:58.000
<v Speaker 5>the subject?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There</v>

781
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:03.010
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are objective facts about </v>

782
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.310
<v Speaker 3>subjective experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can make,</v>

783
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I can make true or false claims about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your subjectivity and that you can make.</v>

784
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.290
<v Speaker 3>You can make those about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own subjectivity,</v>

785
00:45:12.291 --> 00:45:17.291
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be wrong about your own </v>

786
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:17.291
<v Speaker 3>subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

787
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:18.590
<v Speaker 3>we're not subjectively encourageable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

788
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.680
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've said this last time in </v>

789
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

790
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.630
<v Speaker 3>the example I often use here is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculate about what jfk was thinking.</v>

791
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 3>The moment he got shot right is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a completely vacuous exercise there.</v>

792
00:45:35.201 --> 00:45:40.201
<v Speaker 3>They're literally an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things we know he wasn't thinking right?</v>

793
00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.390
<v Speaker 3>So we can make claims about his </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious mind at,</v>

794
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.080
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that moment in history,</v>

795
00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.410
<v Speaker 3>which are scientific a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though the data are unavailable,</v>

796
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:53.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people get confused between </v>

797
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.040
<v Speaker 3>having an answers and practice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be an answers and principle.</v>

798
00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

799
00:45:55.361 --> 00:46:00.361
<v Speaker 3>there are many trivial fact based claims</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could make about reality where we </v>

800
00:46:01.611 --> 00:46:04.520
<v Speaker 3>can't get the data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know the data are there.</v>

801
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

802
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.480
<v Speaker 3>do you have an even or odd number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hairs on your body at this moment?</v>

803
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:09.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

804
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to think about what it </v>

805
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 3>would take to ascertain that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

806
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:14.990
<v Speaker 3>But there is a fact of the matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

807
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it is with anything but.</v>

808
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:20.300
<v Speaker 3>So what is somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does a person way?</v>

809
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.600
<v Speaker 3>There's many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many facts are blurry because you are </v>

810
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:25.600
<v Speaker 3>going to weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weigh him down to the,</v>

811
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.950
<v Speaker 3>the 100th decimal plate place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

812
00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:32.951
<v Speaker 3>So it's like at a certain point you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be rounding and someone's </v>

813
00:46:32.951 --> 00:46:37.391
<v Speaker 3>weight at that point is changing every </v>
<v Speaker 3>microsecond because they're exchanging </v>

814
00:46:37.391 --> 00:46:38.840
<v Speaker 3>adams with the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's.</v>

815
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are facts that can be loosely </v>

816
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

817
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.310
<v Speaker 3>this is still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is true of all of our subjective </v>

818
00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.400
<v Speaker 3>lives too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it is a fact about you that when </v>

819
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.820
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were praying to Jesus,</v>

820
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Speaker 3>you felt an upwelling of rapture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

821
00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Subjectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be an absolutely true thing to </v>

822
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.220
<v Speaker 3>say about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can,</v>

823
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.420
<v Speaker 3>we can pair that subject of experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an understanding of,</v>

824
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.660
<v Speaker 3>of the neurophysiological basis for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

825
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you can think about it in terms of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>larger story about your life,</v>

826
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but all of this can be translated into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact based discussion about what's </v>

827
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 3>happening for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my only claim is that,</v>

828
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 3>that the value part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hence the ethics part relates to </v>

829
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the extremes of positive and negative </v>

830
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 3>experience that people have</v>

831
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.550
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

832
00:47:32.551 --> 00:47:37.551
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to dispute the fact that </v>

833
00:47:37.551 --> 00:47:37.650
<v Speaker 5>there are stable quality of pain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pleasure,</v>

834
00:47:37.651 --> 00:47:42.651
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also that there are fundamental </v>

835
00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:43.650
<v Speaker 5>motivational systems that structure our </v>
<v Speaker 5>perception.</v>

836
00:47:43.651 --> 00:47:46.080
<v Speaker 5>So as the nervous system increases in </v>
<v Speaker 5>complexity,</v>

837
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:51.410
<v Speaker 5>these underlying nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 5>subsections that produce these rather </v>

838
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.170
<v Speaker 5>stable quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

839
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.220
<v Speaker 5>evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunger,</v>

840
00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:54.720
<v Speaker 5>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>defensive aggression,</v>

841
00:47:54.721 --> 00:47:56.880
<v Speaker 5>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these subsystems that,</v>

842
00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that label experience with certain </v>

843
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.760
<v Speaker 5>somewhat inviolable labels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that happens.</v>

844
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 5>But the point that I'm trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>here is I think to try to increase the,</v>

845
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:13.670
<v Speaker 5>what would you call the breadth of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation about how facts get </v>

846
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.240
<v Speaker 5>translated into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into values?</v>

847
00:48:15.241 --> 00:48:19.500
<v Speaker 5>Because it seems to me the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that your account doesn't take proper.</v>

848
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:25.130
<v Speaker 5>And this is what surprised me so much </v>
<v Speaker 5>about your thinking when I first </v>

849
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.130
<v Speaker 5>encountered it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

850
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 5>I think the manner in which facts are </v>
<v Speaker 5>translated into values is something that</v>

851
00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:30.450
<v Speaker 5>actually evolved.</v>

852
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 5>And it evolved over three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 5>billion years.</v>

853
00:48:33.331 --> 00:48:34.920
<v Speaker 5>The three and a half billion years of </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

854
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:40.070
<v Speaker 5>And it built the nervous system from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom up and it built this reducing </v>

855
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:43.521
<v Speaker 5>mechanism that takes the infinite number</v>
<v Speaker 5>of facts and translates them into a </v>

856
00:48:43.521 --> 00:48:45.060
<v Speaker 5>single value per action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it does that in layers.</v>

857
00:48:45.061 --> 00:48:50.061
<v Speaker 5>And so there is a relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world of facts in the world of </v>

858
00:48:50.061 --> 00:48:50.370
<v Speaker 5>values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there has to be,</v>

859
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.400
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't derival one to one in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>confines of your single existence </v>

860
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.110
<v Speaker 5>through pure rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way more complicated than that</v>

861
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.360
<v Speaker 3>if there's more to it than rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

862
00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not rationality that causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove your hand from a hot stove and </v>

863
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.871
<v Speaker 3>it's not rationality that causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the experience of love and bliss </v>

864
00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:19.181
<v Speaker 3>and rapture and creativity over or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than pointless misery and despair.</v>

865
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like things other than rationality </v>

866
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:26.780
<v Speaker 3>are clearly necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

867
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.700
<v Speaker 3>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we ever have to be irrational to get </v>

868
00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 3>the good things in life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would argue that,</v>

869
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that the answer to that clearly no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing irrational about loving </v>

870
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.150
<v Speaker 3>your wife or your best friend or </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself or even a stranger if,</v>

871
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:49.190
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if what you mean by love there is </v>

872
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.910
<v Speaker 3>genuinely wanting happiness for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

873
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.000
<v Speaker 3>genuinely taken pleasure in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

874
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 3>genuinely wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find a way of being where you're,</v>

875
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.140
<v Speaker 3>you're no longer in a zero sum condition</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a stranger or with a partner,</v>

876
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.920
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

877
00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:08.921
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>collaborating together to have better </v>

878
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:11.081
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems rationality moves through that </v>

879
00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:13.910
<v Speaker 3>situation continuously because </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality is the only way that you and</v>

880
00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I can get our representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world to cohere.</v>

881
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.650
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when I say,</v>

882
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

883
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a lion behind that rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go over there that only that only </v>

884
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.931
<v Speaker 3>makes sense to you if you're playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this rationality game it the way I'm </v>

885
00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:32.521
<v Speaker 3>planted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I mean something else by lion or I </v>

886
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:32.521
<v Speaker 3>mean something else by don't go over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

887
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're confused and,</v>

888
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 3>and very likely did or not.</v>

889
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 5>If we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're trying to establish the </v>

890
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.671
<v Speaker 5>proposition that rationality is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism by which we make our </v>

891
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:45.330
<v Speaker 5>worldviews cohere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would agree with that in part,</v>

892
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 5>we also will make them cohere because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're actually biologically structured </v>

893
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.661
<v Speaker 5>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's a proclivity for them to </v>

894
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:55.761
<v Speaker 5>go here to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we iron out our differences through </v>

895
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:55.761
<v Speaker 5>the exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't call it rationality.</v>

896
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:57.640
<v Speaker 5>I would call it logos because I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a more,</v>

897
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.530
<v Speaker 5>it's a broader</v>

898
00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.980
<v Speaker 3>were you smuggling energy's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious of that.</v>

899
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Let's say as a point of order here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

900
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:09.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

901
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm a disconcerted by Douglas is </v>
<v Speaker 3>silence.</v>

902
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to pivot because I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how good he is when he actually </v>

903
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 3>speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

904
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:24.130
<v Speaker 3>so I want to pivot to another subject </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can return to this at some </v>

905
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:24.420
<v Speaker 3>point we need to have before you pivot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

906
00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:24.740
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

907
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said to you what I think your </v>

908
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.720
<v Speaker 1>concern is with Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan's concerned,</v>

909
00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:36.130
<v Speaker 1>and I share this just as I share some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your concerns expressed at the outset,</v>

910
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Jordan's fundamental concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me as a one I fundamentally </v>

911
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:46.591
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rationalism isn't enough and </v>

912
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

913
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.170
<v Speaker 3>put it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then let me finish.</v>

914
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Can you both show me where it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's obviously insufficient like </v>

915
00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:00.010
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing but.</v>

916
00:52:00.011 --> 00:52:05.011
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to say that it's not to say that </v>

917
00:52:05.011 --> 00:52:07.381
<v Speaker 3>there's more to life than being rational</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not to say and perhaps never to say </v>

918
00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:13.740
<v Speaker 3>you need to run against rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need to be irrational in order to get </v>

919
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:13.740
<v Speaker 3>something good.</v>

920
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me express it a different way.</v>

921
00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't tried the purely rational </v>

922
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.500
<v Speaker 1>approach yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't tried it for very long,</v>

923
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

924
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:27.670
<v Speaker 3>many of us had been trying for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of centuries at least,</v>

925
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.620
<v Speaker 3>which is a blip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the tiniest.at</v>

926
00:52:31.621 --> 00:52:33.780
<v Speaker 3>the end of human evolution.</v>

927
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.210
<v Speaker 1>So I think that a concern which Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't said,</v>

928
00:52:37.211 --> 00:52:42.211
<v Speaker 1>any concern I have is if we try this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can think of all sorts of ways in </v>

929
00:52:43.771 --> 00:52:48.771
<v Speaker 1>which you can go wrong if you take away </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the supporting structure can think </v>

930
00:52:49.111 --> 00:52:54.111
<v Speaker 1>of any number of ways in which you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go wrong and that I suppose that that's </v>

931
00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:59.871
<v Speaker 1>at the root of the concern about where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be taking us or to put it </v>

932
00:53:00.691 --> 00:53:05.691
<v Speaker 1>another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we enter the world that you would </v>

933
00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:07.470
<v Speaker 1>suggest not everyone may not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out as Sam Harris.</v>

934
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me one way where you think it can </v>

935
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 3>go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

936
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.400
<v Speaker 3>we can't forget your caveat which you </v>
<v Speaker 3>started with.</v>

937
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.520
<v Speaker 5>What if you're not very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

938
00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person.</v>

939
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.180
<v Speaker 3>So then you're basically saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid people need their myths.</v>

940
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.470
<v Speaker 3>We smart people onstage don't need that.</v>

941
00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:28.650
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

942
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 7>I am actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm looked,</v>

943
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:32.890
<v Speaker 7>I actually am saying that to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 7>that this look,</v>

944
00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:33.850
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're,</v>

945
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 7>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're not exceptionally cognitively </v>

946
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:43.681
<v Speaker 7>astute,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you should be traditional and </v>

947
00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:45.160
<v Speaker 7>conservative because if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you can't think,</v>

948
00:53:45.161 --> 00:53:50.161
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to think badly and if you </v>

949
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:50.161
<v Speaker 7>think badly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to fall into trouble and so</v>

950
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:54.391
<v Speaker 7>it is definitely the case and this has </v>
<v Speaker 7>been an what would you call a cliche of </v>

951
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:57.430
<v Speaker 7>political belief for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're not very smart,</v>

952
00:53:57.431 --> 00:54:02.431
<v Speaker 7>it's better to be conservative because </v>
<v Speaker 7>then you do what everyone else does and </v>

953
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:07.531
<v Speaker 7>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doing what everyone else does is the </v>

954
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:07.531
<v Speaker 7>path of least error moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

955
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 7>that doesn't mean that rationality is </v>
<v Speaker 7>unnecessary.</v>

956
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that old conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 7>astute,</v>

957
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.900
<v Speaker 7>headless.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that either,</v>

958
00:54:13.901 --> 00:54:14.830
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Precisely.</v>

959
00:54:14.831 --> 00:54:16.360
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that Kevin,</v>

960
00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:17.510
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all can,</v>

961
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.540
<v Speaker 3>all conservative structures are not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same either and that we have many </v>

962
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.970
<v Speaker 3>warring and incompatible versions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being conservative.</v>

963
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.910
<v Speaker 7>True,</v>
<v Speaker 7>true,</v>

964
00:54:26.911 --> 00:54:31.911
<v Speaker 7>and this is exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is where rationality actually does </v>

965
00:54:31.911 --> 00:54:34.731
<v Speaker 7>play a role.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Although I don't think it's best </v>

966
00:54:34.731 --> 00:54:34.731
<v Speaker 7>conceptualized as rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>precisely.</v>

967
00:54:34.731 --> 00:54:39.111
<v Speaker 7>It's definitely the case that we tend to</v>
<v Speaker 7>take douglass point that we need to be </v>

968
00:54:40.501 --> 00:54:45.501
<v Speaker 7>bound by our traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we need to be judicious in their </v>

969
00:54:45.501 --> 00:54:47.700
<v Speaker 7>representation and update and we have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>do both</v>

970
00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the dialogue on religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what he says.</v>

971
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:54.020
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he describes the tragedy of the clergy.</v>

972
00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.900
<v Speaker 1>He pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much says,</v>

973
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.300
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't believe it,</v>

974
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.520
<v Speaker 1>they recognize it's a very useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor,</v>

975
00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:06.521
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's they tell it and he says the </v>

976
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:09.140
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of the clergy is they can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that what they're saying is just a</v>

977
00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:09.710
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

978
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just before or after he threw his </v>

979
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:14.990
<v Speaker 3>housekeeper down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

980
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:17.670
<v Speaker 3>we can all find flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have skeletons in our closet.</v>

981
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

982
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

983
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

984
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:27.160
<v Speaker 1>there is a way in which religion is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he describes his philosophy for the </v>

985
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.871
<v Speaker 1>masses and that if you recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are not gonna spend their </v>

986
00:55:31.871 --> 00:55:35.351
<v Speaker 1>lives studying philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be reading about </v>

987
00:55:35.351 --> 00:55:36.590
<v Speaker 1>the differences between live Nixon comp </v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion has to do.</v>

988
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that I agree with that </v>

989
00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:42.310
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a heck of an argument within</v>

990
00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:44.330
<v Speaker 1>the which a lot of people will be living</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives in.</v>

991
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:49.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a good argument if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you recall or I just imagine what it's </v>

992
00:55:50.991 --> 00:55:53.390
<v Speaker 3>like to be a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially from the perspective of being</v>

993
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:58.391
<v Speaker 3>a parent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two young girls and they,</v>

994
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very smart young girl.</v>

995
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.250
<v Speaker 3>They're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

996
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 3>one of them is four and a half years old</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those almost nothing.</v>

997
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she knows what I and my wife and our </v>

998
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.010
<v Speaker 3>society tell her at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

999
00:56:14.011 --> 00:56:19.011
<v Speaker 3>at what point is she going to think for </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself about these fundamental </v>

1000
00:56:19.011 --> 00:56:19.850
<v Speaker 3>questions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean she again,</v>

1001
00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:24.851
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's currently spending half the day </v>

1002
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:24.851
<v Speaker 3>dressed up like batgirl or cat woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1003
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:29.790
<v Speaker 3>So if I told her that these superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 3>were real,</v>

1004
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.830
<v Speaker 3>she would believe that for the longest </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and if she,</v>

1005
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:38.870
<v Speaker 3>if we lived in a cult that thought they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were real or a whole society that by </v>

1006
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:43.291
<v Speaker 3>dint of its geographic or linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation managed to maintain a </v>

1007
00:56:43.291 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 3>conversation about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this case batgirl and catwoman,</v>

1008
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:52.500
<v Speaker 3>that they were real and that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely important to honor them and </v>

1009
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you'd burn in hell if you fail to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1010
00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.780
<v Speaker 3>but this would be.</v>

1011
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.020
<v Speaker 3>We would be meeting fully grown adults </v>
<v Speaker 3>who believed this sort of thing,</v>

1012
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.370
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>

1013
00:57:00.371 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 3>that you bring up the superhero thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a bit.</v>

1014
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:05.780
<v Speaker 3>So I think I'll go to that directly so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I want.</v>

1015
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 3>I love superheroes so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1016
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1017
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 5>you make the case in a moral landscape </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're an ideal is real because </v>

1018
00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:18.170
<v Speaker 5>the ideal that you define an ideal is </v>
<v Speaker 5>real and the ideal is whatever.</v>

1019
00:57:18.171 --> 00:57:20.510
<v Speaker 5>Maximize wellbeing and gets us away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>hell.</v>

1020
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:25.690
<v Speaker 5>You said not only is that real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you also say that's the fundamental </v>

1021
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:26.240
<v Speaker 5>axiom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the claim in the moral landscape.</v>

1022
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.540
<v Speaker 5>So you do make a claim that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real ideal,</v>

1023
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:30.050
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1024
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't necessarily put it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a real.</v>

1025
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.910
<v Speaker 3>We are in a circumstance where things </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't matter,</v>

1026
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:43.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We consciousness is the key is the </v>

1027
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.461
<v Speaker 3>condition in which things can matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there can be a range of </v>

1028
00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:46.490
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of which are very,</v>

1029
00:57:46.491 --> 00:57:49.070
<v Speaker 3>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the word bad means anything,</v>

1030
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.830
<v Speaker 3>they're bad and some of which are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

1031
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 3>If the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the word good means anything and we </v>

1032
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.811
<v Speaker 3>are navigating in that space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't help it navigate it or seek to </v>

1033
00:57:58.811 --> 00:58:00.800
<v Speaker 3>navigate in that space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And religion is one.</v>

1034
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look more of a conversation.</v>

1035
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 3>That navigation problem and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue and go back to the idea that </v>

1036
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:08.430
<v Speaker 3>diluted one like Jordan rose</v>

1037
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.680
<v Speaker 5>sleeves up that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we mean business now,</v>

1038
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.540
<v Speaker 5>but that girl in cat woman are </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximations to a higher ideal.</v>

1039
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 5>That's what they are.</v>

1040
00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And and do attendance with a biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1041
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fairly sure if person there are a </v>

1042
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:29.120
<v Speaker 1>lot of parents are perfectly content </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bringing their children up vaguely </v>

1043
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.471
<v Speaker 1>within the story they've inherited and </v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point the children realize that </v>

1044
00:58:33.471 --> 00:58:37.461
<v Speaker 1>the fairy doesn't bring them money when </v>
<v Speaker 1>their teeth fall out and at some point </v>

1045
00:58:37.461 --> 00:58:38.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe around the same time or a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

1046
00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:41.820
<v Speaker 1>they discovered the Santa Claus doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really come down the chimney and at some</v>

1047
00:58:41.821 --> 00:58:46.821
<v Speaker 1>point they realized that actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole religious thing is a kind of </v>

1048
00:58:46.821 --> 00:58:49.611
<v Speaker 1>metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got them through the formative </v>

1049
00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:51.441
<v Speaker 1>years in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often with terrible damage along the </v>

1050
00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:51.441
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that,</v>

1051
00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:52.140
<v Speaker 1>but also with something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm.</v>

1052
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm struck by the number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I share some of what I </v>

1053
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.020
<v Speaker 1>think is Jordan's concerned about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of the world.</v>

1054
00:58:58.021 --> 00:59:01.710
<v Speaker 1>You're envisaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I can think of a lot of parents</v>

1055
00:59:01.711 --> 00:59:06.711
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my country and other countries as well </v>

1056
00:59:06.711 --> 00:59:06.711
<v Speaker 1>who I'm just very struck.</v>

1057
00:59:06.711 --> 00:59:10.560
<v Speaker 1>They themselves a kind of baby boomer or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties atheists,</v>

1058
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.970
<v Speaker 1>humanists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1059
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and I start to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

1060
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:18.450
<v Speaker 1>that they're enrolling their children in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian schools and I saved them.</v>

1061
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have fairly coherent arguments </v>

1062
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>along the way with the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one I just had,</v>

1063
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:31.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't particularly believe this </v>

1064
00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:33.311
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a pretty good way to </v>

1065
00:59:33.311 --> 00:59:33.860
<v Speaker 1>bring up the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the structure of a kind and I'm not</v>

1066
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:36.050
<v Speaker 1>sure I can find all sorts of flaws in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1067
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but enough people are doing it that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that needs to be addressed.</v>

1068
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 3>What I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's I would say yes,</v>

1069
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:48.110
<v Speaker 3>it speaks to a real failure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and an effort in the secular</v>

1070
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 3>community to produce truly non </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing alternative.</v>

1071
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1072
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this is,</v>

1073
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.250
<v Speaker 3>this is across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not just school,</v>

1074
01:00:02.251 --> 01:00:05.280
<v Speaker 3>this is how do you conduct a funeral?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get married,</v>

1075
01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:06.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the it.</v>

1076
01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:09.330
<v Speaker 3>What rites of passage can you offer a 13</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old</v>

1077
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing to have,</v>

1078
01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>how to have the first people in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have absolutely no explanation for </v>

1079
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing at all.</v>

1080
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a big moment.</v>

1081
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1082
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:30.130
<v Speaker 3>And that's the noise that sharpens up my</v>
<v Speaker 3>concern perfectly,</v>

1083
01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:35.531
<v Speaker 3>because to to shrink back from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment and resort to one of the,</v>

1084
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 3>the pseudo stories of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consider it to be a failure of nerve,</v>

1085
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 3>both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both intellectually and morally.</v>

1086
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:49.790
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So let,</v>

1087
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 8>let's go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to the</v>

1088
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:52.680
<v Speaker 7>hero idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the,</v>

1089
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
<v Speaker 7>one of the things you might notice about</v>
<v Speaker 7>superheroes is that some of them are </v>

1090
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.581
<v Speaker 7>actually Dante's right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So in the Marvel Pantheon you have thor </v>

1091
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:00.930
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so there's a,</v>

1092
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.960
<v Speaker 7>there's a very thin line between the </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea of the superhero and the idea of a </v>

1093
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.820
<v Speaker 7>god,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially if you think about it in a </v>

1094
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.621
<v Speaker 7>polytheistic manner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the modern superheroes and the Greek </v>

1095
01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:11.621
<v Speaker 7>gods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1096
01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:13.760
<v Speaker 7>share a tremendous number of features in</v>
<v Speaker 7>common.</v>

1097
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.600
<v Speaker 7>And so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's,</v>

1098
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:20.770
<v Speaker 7>here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's a reason that people admire </v>

1099
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 7>superheroes and it's because they act </v>
<v Speaker 7>out parts of the hero archetype.</v>

1100
01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:28.121
<v Speaker 7>That's the technical reason.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're obviously acting something out </v>

1101
01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:28.730
<v Speaker 7>because that's how you can tell they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>superheroes.</v>

1102
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:33.940
<v Speaker 7>They share some set of characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 7>across the set of superheroes that makes</v>

1103
01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:37.400
<v Speaker 7>them super heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now the question might be,</v>

1104
01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:42.790
<v Speaker 7>what is the essential element of being a</v>
<v Speaker 7>superhero that makes you a superhero and</v>

1105
01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:47.951
<v Speaker 7>the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way that that was solved </v>

1106
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.631
<v Speaker 7>historically is that as a polytheistic </v>
<v Speaker 7>society is developed and that was </v>

1107
01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:52.370
<v Speaker 7>usually a consequence of isolated tribes</v>
<v Speaker 7>coming into contact with one another.</v>

1108
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:57.550
<v Speaker 7>They each had their separate deities and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then over the course of time those </v>

1109
01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.451
<v Speaker 7>deities ward in actual wars with people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but also conceptually and out of that </v>

1110
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:07.181
<v Speaker 7>polytheistic framework was extracted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something that was vaguely monotheistic </v>

1111
01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:11.321
<v Speaker 7>as all of those cultures came together </v>
<v Speaker 7>to try to determine what their highest </v>

1112
01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:13.190
<v Speaker 7>ideals should be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's the god of Gods.</v>

1113
01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 7>That's a way of thinking about it or the</v>
<v Speaker 7>king of kings.</v>

1114
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 7>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's an implicit ideal,</v>

1115
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.210
<v Speaker 7>but could make a case.</v>

1116
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.560
<v Speaker 3>You tell that to the Hindus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they got one point,</v>

1117
01:02:24.561 --> 01:02:27.410
<v Speaker 3>2 billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's one point four now who are</v>

1118
01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:32.411
<v Speaker 3>operating in a in a religiously </v>
<v Speaker 3>saturated system that does not conform </v>

1119
01:02:32.841 --> 01:02:34.550
<v Speaker 3>to that ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no one</v>

1120
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.340
<v Speaker 5>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're still,</v>

1121
01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:39.160
<v Speaker 5>they're still associated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arguably there's three on top of it all,</v>

1122
01:02:39.161 --> 01:02:40.570
<v Speaker 5>but there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1123
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 5>there's still an attempt to generate </v>
<v Speaker 5>that polytheistic and to integrate that </v>

1124
01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:51.091
<v Speaker 5>polytheistic reality underneath a single</v>
<v Speaker 5>rubric or you have nothing but </v>

1125
01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:54.430
<v Speaker 5>continually dissociation of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not saying this is necessarily </v>

1126
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.430
<v Speaker 5>true</v>

1127
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 3>description of what's going on in India </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment.</v>

1128
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.130
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

1129
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that this is inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 5>either and there is a tension.</v>

1130
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:00.830
<v Speaker 5>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem Mrs.</v>

1131
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 5>Niches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>observation and remember Jay Elliot as </v>

1132
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:08.121
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with extracting out the </v>

1133
01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:10.371
<v Speaker 5>highest God from the panoply of Gods is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ideal becomes so abstract that it </v>

1134
01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:11.220
<v Speaker 5>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the death of God.</v>

1135
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:14.040
<v Speaker 5>And let us track that phenomena over </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple cultures,</v>

1136
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 5>not it's not something that's unique to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the west.</v>

1137
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.730
<v Speaker 5>So the danger of that abstraction is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it gets too abstract and disappears</v>

1138
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 5>and leaves us in this situation that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Douglas just pointed out.</v>

1139
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Can I throw this back to the key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key issue of Elton John's glass,</v>

1140
01:03:29.141 --> 01:03:34.141
<v Speaker 1>which you came up with the other night </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's something that I wanted </v>

1141
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:34.141
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add to that.</v>

1142
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>That would explain why I said Elton </v>
<v Speaker 1>John's class just now.</v>

1143
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we came back to this question of </v>

1144
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>what makes something valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I used as an example in Vancouver.</v>

1145
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those nights if I had a glass</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1146
01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 3>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I said was actually it was the </v>

1147
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>glass that Elton John used the last time</v>
<v Speaker 3>he played in this theater.</v>

1148
01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly it seems to be a more valuable </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass and that Jordan and I argued about</v>

1149
01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:05.980
<v Speaker 3>what the status of that value was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I don't know where you want.</v>

1150
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just one thing in particular,</v>

1151
01:04:08.681 --> 01:04:13.681
<v Speaker 1>which is the whole issue of what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you give value to and let's let's say </v>

1152
01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:19.261
<v Speaker 1>that that glass was demonstrated for </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to having been drunk from by Elton </v>

1153
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>John at his final concert at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no latest farewell tour,</v>

1154
01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:28.441
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's already a glass with </v>

1155
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:34.100
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that over the years the whole </v>

1156
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>attribution of that glass becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>debatable over a long period of time.</v>

1157
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things are going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened around it and to stretch this </v>

1158
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>to breaking point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>

1159
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>let's say at some point people lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives over whether that is Elton </v>

1160
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>John's glass or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the people to lose blood,</v>

1161
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:57.110
<v Speaker 3>not just say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's recognize that is the world we're </v>

1162
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:57.110
<v Speaker 3>living in with respect to the</v>

1163
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>so religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the problem is that we end up,</v>

1164
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking to the same thing,</v>

1165
01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:06.511
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just talking about any </v>

1166
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:10.291
<v Speaker 1>inherent worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking also about the worth of </v>

1167
01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 1>things people have given up for this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we end up giving the layers of </v>

1168
01:05:13.781 --> 01:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What knows?</v>

1169
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We inherit more,</v>

1170
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:22.140
<v Speaker 1>more layers if the meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because other people before us have </v>

1171
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>given that meaning to it so that by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you have this object,</v>

1172
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an object of worth even if it's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>no worth in itself at all because of the</v>

1173
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:34.090
<v Speaker 1>amount of worth of people before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have given to it.</v>

1174
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to some extent what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with the religion discussion.</v>

1175
01:05:38.861 --> 01:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1176
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1177
01:05:39.941 --> 01:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1178
01:05:40.421 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1179
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>that's extraordinarily productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1180
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See</v>

1181
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.590
<v Speaker 7>when you start with the hypothesis of </v>
<v Speaker 7>facts,</v>

1182
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 7>then you kind of have to define what a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fact is and so I think the simplest way </v>

1183
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.300
<v Speaker 7>of doing that to begin with is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a set of objective facts.</v>

1184
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:59.000
<v Speaker 7>That's the facts about objective </v>
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>

1185
01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:04.180
<v Speaker 7>You can think about that from a </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific perspective and we're going </v>

1186
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:04.190
<v Speaker 7>to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to agree that that exists,</v>

1187
01:06:04.191 --> 01:06:09.191
<v Speaker 7>although it's very complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 7>difficult to understand that exists has </v>

1188
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:11.090
<v Speaker 7>one set of constraints on what we can do</v>
<v Speaker 7>and what we can do.</v>

1189
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.790
<v Speaker 7>That's the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then on top of that,</v>

1190
01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:16.250
<v Speaker 7>and this is where things get very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very complicated.</v>

1191
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 7>You have this layered system of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 7>which is partly a manifestation of these</v>

1192
01:06:22.131 --> 01:06:24.200
<v Speaker 7>layers of the nervous system that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>described,</v>

1193
01:06:24.201 --> 01:06:29.201
<v Speaker 7>but also partly a manifestation of those</v>
<v Speaker 7>layers of the nervous system operating </v>

1194
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.820
<v Speaker 7>in social space over vast periods of </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

1195
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.430
<v Speaker 7>So that would be the social sociological</v>
<v Speaker 7>agreement.</v>

1196
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.700
<v Speaker 7>That's all layered on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>objective world and it actually </v>

1197
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.431
<v Speaker 7>constitutes part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Lens through which you view the </v>

1198
01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:45.491
<v Speaker 7>world to the degree where you actually </v>
<v Speaker 7>see the layering in the thing,</v>

1199
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.460
<v Speaker 7>so like when you go to a museum and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>look at Elvis Presley,</v>

1200
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:54.080
<v Speaker 7>Elvis Presley's guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't look at the guitar and think,</v>

1201
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:57.710
<v Speaker 7>that's Elvis Presley's guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not how your brain works.</v>

1202
01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:02.600
<v Speaker 7>You actually see Elvis Presley's guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an active perception,</v>

1203
01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:06.050
<v Speaker 7>so it becomes built right into your </v>
<v Speaker 7>nervous system even though the fact that</v>

1204
01:07:06.051 --> 01:07:11.051
<v Speaker 7>that is Elvis Presley's guitar and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>reason that that's valuable is because </v>

1205
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 7>of a sociological agreement about what </v>
<v Speaker 7>position Elvis Presley occupied in the </v>

1206
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.240
<v Speaker 7>dominance hierarchy that we're all part </v>
<v Speaker 7>of.</v>

1207
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:21.740
<v Speaker 7>And so what you see when you look at an </v>
<v Speaker 7>artifact like that is you see a layer of</v>

1208
01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:26.000
<v Speaker 7>dominance hierarchy overlaid on top of </v>
<v Speaker 7>an objective reality and that's actually</v>

1209
01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:31.001
<v Speaker 7>your phenomenal reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now the thing that's so interesting is </v>

1210
01:07:31.001 --> 01:07:34.541
<v Speaker 7>that layer of perception that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>mediating between the facts and you has </v>

1211
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:39.401
<v Speaker 7>a structure and that's the structure </v>
<v Speaker 7>that I've been insisting is a narrative </v>

1212
01:07:39.401 --> 01:07:40.850
<v Speaker 7>and I think Sam thinks it's a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>

1213
01:07:40.851 --> 01:07:45.851
<v Speaker 7>because his fundamental ethic is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you should act in a way which means to </v>

1214
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:50.471
<v Speaker 7>embody a mode of being,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which means to be a personality that </v>

1215
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:52.300
<v Speaker 7>moves us from hell to something </v>
<v Speaker 7>approximating</v>

1216
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:57.310
<v Speaker 6>you haven't what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm struggling to understand what I </v>

1217
01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:04.371
<v Speaker 6>don't understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how any of that is a counterpoint to my </v>

1218
01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:06.320
<v Speaker 6>concern about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for it,</v>

1219
01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:07.800
<v Speaker 6>because I agree with all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there,</v>

1220
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:09.480
<v Speaker 6>there are some caveats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would issue,</v>

1221
01:08:09.481 --> 01:08:14.481
<v Speaker 6>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's quite possible to walk into a </v>

1222
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:14.481
<v Speaker 6>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be shown a guitar,</v>

1223
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:14.481
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1224
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 6>it's elvis guitar and then</v>

1225
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 3>be told it's to Elvis Presley's guitar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see in real time that change</v>

1226
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and significant so that you can see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>layers of the perceptual,</v>

1227
01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:27.340
<v Speaker 3>the meeting a crew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might actually not even kidding,</v>

1228
01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 3>you might know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who else Elvis Presley is and not care.</v>

1229
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are many different,</v>

1230
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on,</v>

1231
01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:37.301
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the menu here as opposed to just </v>

1232
01:08:37.301 --> 01:08:37.301
<v Speaker 3>beholding Austrac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elvis,</v>

1233
01:08:37.301 --> 01:08:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Presley's guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1234
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 3>and the same is true of the Jesus story </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything else that,</v>

1235
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>that you can find layers of engagement </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

1236
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.780
<v Speaker 3>that they may be more and less useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fundamental concern is that the way </v>

1237
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:55.361
<v Speaker 3>you are tending to dignify the religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>subset of stories as being fun,</v>

1238
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 3>foundational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary,</v>

1239
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.540
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we criticized at our peril,</v>

1240
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:08.140
<v Speaker 3>is giving people license to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they clearly shouldn't </v>

1241
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:14.441
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that are intrinsically divisive </v>

1242
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:16.781
<v Speaker 3>in intrinsically less than optimal as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as organizing and individual human </v>

1243
01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:21.551
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do better than Christianity on </v>

1244
01:09:21.551 --> 01:09:26.050
<v Speaker 3>almost every question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with the possible exception of </v>

1245
01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 3>building churches.</v>

1246
01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.320
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the first thing is,</v>

1247
01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 7>the first thing is that I deeply agree </v>
<v Speaker 7>with you that that mechanism can go </v>

1248
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.930
<v Speaker 7>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1249
01:09:33.931 --> 01:09:37.230
<v Speaker 7>so you have the objective world and it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>one set of constraints and then you have</v>

1250
01:09:37.231 --> 01:09:42.231
<v Speaker 7>this interpretive structure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm not saying that that </v>

1251
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:42.450
<v Speaker 7>interpretive structure is infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It clearly isn't,</v>

1252
01:09:42.451 --> 01:09:44.580
<v Speaker 7>and neither is the process that gives </v>
<v Speaker 7>rise to it.</v>

1253
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.990
<v Speaker 7>You see this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1254
01:09:45.991 --> 01:09:50.991
<v Speaker 7>in conditions like manic depressive </v>
<v Speaker 7>disorder with religious delusions or </v>

1255
01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:54.270
<v Speaker 7>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see what you see in those situations</v>

1256
01:09:54.271 --> 01:09:57.960
<v Speaker 7>is a pathologization of that overlay of </v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning that can clearly.</v>

1257
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:03.190
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now the question is what do we do about </v>

1258
01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.201
<v Speaker 7>that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we keep those perceptual </v>

1259
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:06.720
<v Speaker 7>structures which are somewhat arbitrary?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we keep them functional,</v>

1260
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 7>and this is I think where your </v>
<v Speaker 7>discussion of rationality is so </v>

1261
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.720
<v Speaker 7>important,</v>
<v Speaker 7>particularly when you say rationality is</v>

1262
01:10:12.721 --> 01:10:16.770
<v Speaker 7>what enables us to establish what will </v>
<v Speaker 7>you agree on in our shared reality.</v>

1263
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:18.840
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so so imagine this,</v>

1264
01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:22.080
<v Speaker 7>so part of the way you orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the world of facts,</v>

1265
01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 7>objective facts is through your senses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you basically have five dimensions of</v>

1266
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.520
<v Speaker 7>triangulation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

1267
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:32.100
<v Speaker 7>to help you determine what's there in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the objective world,</v>

1268
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:37.430
<v Speaker 7>and then you have this multilayer </v>
<v Speaker 7>structure that's partly biological and </v>

1269
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:41.331
<v Speaker 7>partly socio culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that cultural that enables you to </v>

1270
01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.630
<v Speaker 7>distill that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it can go astray part because it </v>

1271
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:47.841
<v Speaker 7>ages and becomes archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is an and demented for that </v>

1272
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:51.891
<v Speaker 7>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is partly your objection to the </v>

1273
01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:51.891
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalist types.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This has been known for a very long time</v>

1274
01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:53.880
<v Speaker 7>that this sort of thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what we do,</v>

1275
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:56.880
<v Speaker 7>the way we solved that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have a solution to that.</v>

1276
01:10:57.030 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 7>So partly the way we solve that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>through articulated discourse,</v>

1277
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.960
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because you have a way of looking at the</v>

1278
01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:08.961
<v Speaker 7>world and I have a way of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 7>world and we have to occupy the same </v>

1279
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:12.201
<v Speaker 7>space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're probably wrong about some </v>

1280
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.991
<v Speaker 7>things and I'm probably wrong about some</v>
<v Speaker 7>things and hopefully if we we can sort </v>

1281
01:11:14.991 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 7>out the differences and make things more</v>
<v Speaker 7>stable</v>

1282
01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.670
<v Speaker 6>and I would put rationality right in </v>
<v Speaker 6>that place.</v>

1283
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:22.790
<v Speaker 6>That's by rationality is prime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1284
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.670
<v Speaker 7>The problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fair enough.</v>

1285
01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:26.620
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's a problem with that too.</v>

1286
01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:31.180
<v Speaker 7>And I see all the times we've talked so </v>
<v Speaker 7>far,</v>

1287
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:36.630
<v Speaker 7>you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say the Avatar of a scientific </v>

1288
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:37.150
<v Speaker 7>viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'd been cast,</v>

1289
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.160
<v Speaker 7>let's say as the Avatar of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 7>viewpoint,</v>

1290
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 7>but I've actually thought this through </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientifically a lot and I can make a </v>

1291
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.840
<v Speaker 7>biological argument for all of this and </v>
<v Speaker 7>a developmental argument.</v>

1292
01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:49.300
<v Speaker 7>So it isn't only rationality that does </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

1293
01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:52.120
<v Speaker 7>So this is what the thing that was so </v>
<v Speaker 7>cool about studying,</v>

1294
01:11:52.121 --> 01:11:53.860
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>John Piaget,</v>

1295
01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.040
<v Speaker 7>because one of the things piaget pointed</v>
<v Speaker 7>out is that children engage in </v>

1296
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 7>negotiation it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they negotiate the rep,</v>

1297
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 7>they reality just like adults do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they don't do it only through </v>

1298
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.841
<v Speaker 7>articulated speech and neither do adults</v>
<v Speaker 7>with children do is they get together </v>

1299
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:14.011
<v Speaker 7>and play and this is why play is so </v>
<v Speaker 7>important for children that starts to </v>

1300
01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:18.541
<v Speaker 7>happen when there were about three years</v>
<v Speaker 7>of all because they can look outside </v>

1301
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:21.400
<v Speaker 7>their own idiosyncratic perspective at </v>
<v Speaker 7>three and they can start to take someone</v>

1302
01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:26.401
<v Speaker 7>else's view point into consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what you have to do if you're </v>

1303
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:26.401
<v Speaker 7>going to play.</v>

1304
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:28.840
<v Speaker 7>And then what children do is they invent</v>
<v Speaker 7>little fictional realities.</v>

1305
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.790
<v Speaker 7>That's what they do when they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretending.</v>

1306
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 7>And so they assigned each other roles </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they assigned a plot and a drama to </v>

1307
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.840
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to the pretend play and then they act it</v>

1308
01:12:37.841 --> 01:12:41.020
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And in that action they bring themselves</v>

1309
01:12:41.021 --> 01:12:42.970
<v Speaker 7>into harmonious union.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1310
01:12:42.971 --> 01:12:46.540
<v Speaker 7>Which is the act of generating a game </v>
<v Speaker 7>that everyone wants to play.</v>

1311
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 7>And Piaget's observation was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is Nietzschean observation as </v>

1312
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.231
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the morality that characterizes </v>

1313
01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 7>society isn't rationality top down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although it's partly that it's also </v>

1314
01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.270
<v Speaker 7>interactions that are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>

1315
01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:04.300
<v Speaker 7>play based and bought them up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's actually how it evolved to </v>

1316
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.390
<v Speaker 7>begin with because animals generate </v>
<v Speaker 7>societies that are functional,</v>

1317
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:09.340
<v Speaker 7>but they don't do it through </v>
<v Speaker 7>rationality.</v>

1318
01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.530
<v Speaker 7>They can't because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 7>rationality,</v>

1319
01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:16.710
<v Speaker 7>they don't have articulated speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have something like an embodied </v>

1320
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:17.740
<v Speaker 7>game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now what happens,</v>

1321
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 7>and this is a Nietzschean observation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's the first person I learned this </v>

1322
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.771
<v Speaker 7>from,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is our morality emerged from the bottom </v>

1323
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:28.501
<v Speaker 7>up through through thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hundreds of thousands of years have </v>

1324
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:29.570
<v Speaker 7>shared games,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say at the end,</v>

1325
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 7>the interweaving of those shared games </v>
<v Speaker 7>into something approximating a morality </v>

1326
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.190
<v Speaker 7>that we could all live within </v>
<v Speaker 7>peacefully.</v>

1327
01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 7>That happened bottom up and then what </v>
<v Speaker 7>happened was because we didn't know the </v>

1328
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:45.751
<v Speaker 7>mechanism behind that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>instantiated in our nervous system </v>

1329
01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:47.580
<v Speaker 7>invisibly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We watched ourselves act,</v>

1330
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 7>which is what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then we told stories about that </v>

1331
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:53.350
<v Speaker 7>because that's what we do when we watch </v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself act,</v>

1332
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:58.530
<v Speaker 7>and then we encapsulated the morality </v>
<v Speaker 7>that evolved in the stories and that's </v>

1333
01:13:59.051 --> 01:14:00.880
<v Speaker 7>the religious essence of the story.</v>

1334
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 8>Ten seconds</v>

1335
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.740
<v Speaker 6>we have to pivot to Douglas for a a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an important question,</v>

1336
01:14:08.741 --> 01:14:10.600
<v Speaker 6>but I would just say in response to </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1337
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 6>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't</v>

1338
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 3>disagree with much of consequence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1339
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 3>My concern however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there is.</v>

1340
01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:23.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why we differentiate </v>

1341
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:26.041
<v Speaker 3>childhood from adulthood and all of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>are stunted to some degree or another in</v>

1342
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 3>a fairly perverse childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason,</v>

1343
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>

1344
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:37.410
<v Speaker 3>what we confront now is a world largely </v>
<v Speaker 3>populated by dangerous children,</v>

1345
01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are in their fifth and sixth decade </v>

1346
01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:43.660
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean running by populated and run by.</v>

1347
01:14:43.661 --> 01:14:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1348
01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:49.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's so real and if anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>typifies the childhood of our species,</v>

1349
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:55.590
<v Speaker 3>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is his religious orthodoxy and in so </v>

1350
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:59.190
<v Speaker 3>far as we're breaking free of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>orthodoxy part and getting something </v>

1351
01:14:59.190 --> 01:14:59.390
<v Speaker 3>that's more scalable and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1352
01:14:59.391 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1353
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 3>and can survive a more pluralistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmopolitan world.</v>

1354
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.140
<v Speaker 3>It is because it is being winnowed at </v>
<v Speaker 3>every point by rationality.</v>

1355
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that at some point we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have a fully defensible,</v>

1356
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.190
<v Speaker 3>rational honoring of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of many of the things you think are,</v>

1357
01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 3>are essential like the power of story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power of ritual or the power of,</v>

1358
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:25.100
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of art that is focused on some sacred </v>

1359
01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:25.100
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1360
01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 3>and the question is how to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1361
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 1>We have a point of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one question,</v>

1362
01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1363
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to hand over to the audience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>q and a and a for a couple of minutes.</v>

1364
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:41.941
<v Speaker 1>I've had a sign being waved at me saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>q and a and really should have been </v>

1365
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:47.270
<v Speaker 1>signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what's gonna happen is we're </v>

1366
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:48.510
<v Speaker 1>going to use your computer.</v>

1367
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.040
<v Speaker 5>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to ask the audience first.</v>

1368
01:15:51.041 --> 01:15:55.990
<v Speaker 5>I think that was what we decided and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>guess you guys get to vote by noise.</v>

1369
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:01.170
<v Speaker 5>There's an inflection point here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can do one of two things and I'll </v>

1370
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.561
<v Speaker 5>let.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll let the first people yell and then </v>

1371
01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:07.321
<v Speaker 5>the second people yell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the question is we can either </v>

1372
01:16:07.321 --> 01:16:09.400
<v Speaker 5>continue the discussion or we can stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go to q and a.</v>

1373
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:11.230
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing we'll do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1374
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 5>how many of you would like us to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go to q and a?</v>

1375
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second,</v>

1376
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.140
<v Speaker 5>second question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many of you would like us to </v>

1377
01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:25.140
<v Speaker 5>continue with the discussion?</v>

1378
01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1379
01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:36.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a successful vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I want to go?</v>

1380
01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to see is the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask a question to both of you.</v>

1381
01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>It's about the three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's more about the two of </v>

1382
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.601
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each of us to one or another degree has </v>

1383
01:16:49.381 --> 01:16:53.700
<v Speaker 3>been described as a gateway drug to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alt right.</v>

1384
01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 3>We've been attacked by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by people left of center as somehow </v>

1385
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.010
<v Speaker 3>inspiring or pandering to right of </v>
<v Speaker 3>center and in many cases,</v>

1386
01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:08.100
<v Speaker 3>far right of center ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1387
01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 3>and ethical</v>

1388
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 6>and pseudo ethical commitments.</v>

1389
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1390
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:15.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1391
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:18.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering if we can steal man,</v>

1392
01:17:18.061 --> 01:17:23.061
<v Speaker 6>the concerns that people have with us </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a few minutes before addressing the </v>

1393
01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 6>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you,</v>

1394
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:29.790
<v Speaker 8>how do you view this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this reaction to your work and.</v>

1395
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to do that first.</v>

1396
01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Can I just say before I do that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say if we were going to go to </v>

1397
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.811
<v Speaker 1>audience Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand it was reminded today that </v>

1398
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:41.811
<v Speaker 1>there's still a blasphemy law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>

1399
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 6>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well am I right on that?</v>

1400
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wait the police.</v>

1401
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm right on time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:53.770
<v Speaker 6>In which case can I just say that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>not going to be happy if we leave the </v>

1403
01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.640
<v Speaker 6>stage tonight in handcuffs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have not both committed last,</v>

1404
01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:01.180
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if Jordan would make hypergrid that </v>

1406
01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.280
<v Speaker 8>to do that in private,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we could make it a full house.</v>

1407
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.450
<v Speaker 6>I really do think we should be last </v>
<v Speaker 6>semester.</v>

1408
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:16.320
<v Speaker 6>I think I must have done that already,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'll have to go to the tape on that.</v>

1409
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1410
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

1411
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.340
<v Speaker 1>we've all had similar experiences on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and there are a number of people in</v>

1412
01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:29.341
<v Speaker 1>our friends and colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you might say you've had it as </v>

1413
01:18:29.341 --> 01:18:29.590
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1414
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and I think what's happening at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment is that there's a set of trip </v>

1415
01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:39.101
<v Speaker 1>wires that have been put across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and for a long time,</v>

1416
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
<v Speaker 1>if you went across these trip wires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you died reputationally speaking because</v>

1417
01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:50.960
<v Speaker 1>of the nature of the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new media,</v>

1418
01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 1>among other things that sudden death </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't possible anymore.</v>

1419
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Or this is not always possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1420
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the New York Times says that Jordan </v>

1421
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.470
<v Speaker 1>sort of leading member of the Ku Klux </v>
<v Speaker 1>Klan,</v>

1423
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that people don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times anymore,</v>

1424
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it's that they can go and find out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that this is a lie.</v>

1425
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it means that people are surviving </v>

1426
01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the trip wire experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a whole set of these trip </v>

1427
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.910
<v Speaker 1>wires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they've been,</v>

1428
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>they've been planted very strangely </v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things.</v>

1429
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I tripped on was Islam one think</v>

1430
01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:33.650
<v Speaker 1>to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the one you tripped on Jordan.</v>

1431
01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It was more to do with farms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns was the first one.</v>

1432
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great thing about this,</v>

1433
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

1434
01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:42.200
<v Speaker 1>once you survived the first trip wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of merrily jump along in no </v>

1436
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>man's land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land</v>

1437
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:51.600
<v Speaker 6>live on ied after ied.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And strangely I'm still here.</v>

1438
01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.250
<v Speaker 1>You said steal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda.</v>

1439
01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I think is probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1440
01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>There was a fear that in this realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain values,</v>

1441
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 1>which we might concede at any rate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a,</v>

1442
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:17.660
<v Speaker 1>there is only one thing we all agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing we all agree on is we </v>

1443
01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>mustn't become Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1444
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the basis of our face.</v>

1445
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the only bit of history anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows and they don't even know it.</v>

1446
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>So they think they're all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler thing.</v>

1447
01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't got a clue.</v>

1448
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Most of them all they know is Hitler was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad person.</v>

1449
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1450
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>anyone anyone doesn't like in politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Hitler like George w Dot Bush,</v>

1451
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had any sense of historical </v>

1452
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.050
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say Henry,</v>

1453
01:20:49.051 --> 01:20:53.790
<v Speaker 1>the fifth domineering father who </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadowed you had to step out of,</v>

1454
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there Henry,</v>

1455
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 1>the fifth myth knows about that.</v>

1456
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:04.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's everything's Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we agree that the one thing we're </v>

1457
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:06.531
<v Speaker 1>all meant to do is not become Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You build these incredibly deep trenches</v>

1458
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:13.580
<v Speaker 1>around anything you think could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would lead us back to </v>

1459
01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:17.841
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that people who have </v>

1460
01:21:17.841 --> 01:21:20.571
<v Speaker 1>done that trench building include people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are doing it for their own personal </v>

1461
01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:26.391
<v Speaker 1>political game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they build a set of trenches around </v>

1462
01:21:26.391 --> 01:21:30.080
<v Speaker 1>their political views and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you come near this and you've gotten </v>

1463
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>into that trench and there were Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is for short term convenience</v>

1464
01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:36.270
<v Speaker 1>and I've no doubt that some of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sincere,</v>

1465
01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:42.940
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of the amount of lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it makes me doubt that last bit,</v>

1466
01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:46.010
<v Speaker 1>and let me add one other thing to that.</v>

1467
01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the books I recommend people read</v>
<v Speaker 1>most to do with politics.</v>

1468
01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:55.801
<v Speaker 1>There's a brilliant book by Paul Berman </v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think you know as well go power </v>

1469
01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and the idealists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>

1470
01:21:57.221 --> 01:21:59.950
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst subtitle of any book.</v>

1471
01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's called power and the idealist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strange passion of Jasko Fisher.</v>

1472
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Now distinguished left wing German </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>

1473
01:22:12.371 --> 01:22:15.280
<v Speaker 1>though he is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1474
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't leap off the shelf.</v>

1475
01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strange passion of Jasko Fisher is </v>

1476
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 1>an amazing book which I wish was taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>in schools because he describes in this </v>

1477
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:29.821
<v Speaker 1>book how this group of Germans who grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the 19 fifties had one but one </v>

1478
01:22:31.631 --> 01:22:36.631
<v Speaker 1>name was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to become like our </v>

1479
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:36.631
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1480
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>If they think it's enough to orient </v>
<v Speaker 1>their politics around what happened,</v>

1481
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green movement melds with the part </v>

1482
01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.170
<v Speaker 1>of the German left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole set of things happen.</v>

1483
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>They ended up agreeing with the PLO and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hijackings in the late sixties and </v>

1484
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:53.860
<v Speaker 1>early seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>

1485
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 1>one of your fishes housemates is on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane as it's on the tarmac and he's </v>

1486
01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:02.590
<v Speaker 1>separating out the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Non Jews,</v>

1487
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.840
<v Speaker 1>we've it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing we are meant not to become</v>

1488
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>was the people standing on the ramp </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that way that way.</v>

1489
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 1>And we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went all the way around.</v>

1490
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 1>So there's something about this that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wish was better known,</v>

1491
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but he's not as damn easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that.</v>

1492
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Like your enemies don't come with Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>boots and swastikas like this.</v>

1493
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1494
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.440
<v Speaker 1>they live inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1495
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Speaker 1>That's really the case.</v>

1496
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:36.120
<v Speaker 2>So let me try this steel manifold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1497
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:36.590
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1498
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:43.650
<v Speaker 9>So the first thing that people assume </v>
<v Speaker 9>about me is that I'm no fan of the </v>

1499
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:47.470
<v Speaker 9>radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's absolutely.</v>

1500
01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:51.940
<v Speaker 9>And that's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I am no fan of</v>

1501
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 2>the radical left.</v>

1502
01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.110
<v Speaker 9>How narrowly,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because there's a variety of reasons,</v>

1503
01:24:00.111 --> 01:24:05.111
<v Speaker 9>but it's primarily because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 9>that the radical left airs in insisting </v>

1504
01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.480
<v Speaker 9>had every possible opportunity that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>proper defining characteristic of each </v>

1505
01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.331
<v Speaker 9>individual is their group membership.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that that's you and you do have </v>

1506
01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:18.530
<v Speaker 9>a group membership.</v>
<v Speaker 9>In fact,</v>

1507
01:24:18.531 --> 01:24:23.531
<v Speaker 9>you have a whole plethora of them which </v>
<v Speaker 9>makes things quite complicated as the </v>

1508
01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:24.230
<v Speaker 9>intersection list have already figured </v>
<v Speaker 9>out.</v>

1509
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:30.490
<v Speaker 9>But whenever someone brings a primary </v>
<v Speaker 9>orientation to the world that is group </v>

1510
01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:32.450
<v Speaker 9>centered rather than individual </v>
<v Speaker 9>centered,</v>

1511
01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:35.120
<v Speaker 9>I think they've already made a </v>
<v Speaker 9>catastrophic mistake.</v>

1512
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:40.330
<v Speaker 9>And so I don't approve of the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's now I don't approve of left wing </v>

1513
01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:43.430
<v Speaker 9>collectivist and I don't approve of </v>
<v Speaker 9>right wing collectivist,</v>

1514
01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 9>but the right wing collectivist haven't </v>
<v Speaker 9>overrun the universities and the lifting</v>

1515
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.290
<v Speaker 9>collected as so.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So that's a distinct difference.</v>

1516
01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 9>Now</v>

1517
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:59.220
<v Speaker 9>leftwing collectivists enjoy acquiring a</v>
<v Speaker 9>certain linguistic hegemony because they</v>

1518
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:05.521
<v Speaker 9>know that that's part of the way they </v>
<v Speaker 9>can win the battle and that's what they </v>

1519
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:08.191
<v Speaker 9>were trying to do when they pass </v>
<v Speaker 9>compelled speech legislation in Canada </v>

1520
01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:12.060
<v Speaker 9>as far as I was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I made a video saying I'm not going </v>

1521
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.841
<v Speaker 9>to abide by that because I'm not using </v>
<v Speaker 9>the reprehensible linguistic maneuvers </v>

1522
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.880
<v Speaker 9>of collectivists who I detest.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So now when I did that,</v>

1523
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 9>you see it was a very strange thing for </v>
<v Speaker 9>a Canadian to do because Canadians don't</v>

1524
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 9>do that partly because Canada works just</v>
<v Speaker 9>fine.</v>

1525
01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 9>And so nobody comes up and says waves </v>
<v Speaker 9>the flag saying,</v>

1526
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:32.310
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're,</v>

1527
01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 9>we're wandering off a dangerous cliff </v>
<v Speaker 9>here.</v>

1528
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.420
<v Speaker 9>And so then if someone does stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 9>say that,</v>

1529
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 9>then the first thing that all the other </v>
<v Speaker 9>Canadians think and should think is that</v>

1530
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 9>there's something wrong with that person</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that would be me.</v>

1531
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 9>So then the question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1532
01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:52.390
<v Speaker 9>what variety of things could be wrong </v>
<v Speaker 9>with Dr Peterson?</v>

1533
01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:57.391
<v Speaker 9>That's a very long list,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the ones that might actually at </v>

1534
01:25:57.391 --> 01:26:01.090
<v Speaker 9>better subtitled the title.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So.</v>

1535
01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 9>So what happened was I objected</v>

1536
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 7>to the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was my perspective,</v>

1537
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:11.210
<v Speaker 7>but the people who objected to me or who</v>
<v Speaker 7>were even critical of mere curious about</v>

1538
01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:12.200
<v Speaker 7>me thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1539
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:17.201
<v Speaker 7>well if Peterson isn't part of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then where the hell is he announcer </v>

1540
01:26:17.201 --> 01:26:20.480
<v Speaker 7>could be anywhere on the political </v>
<v Speaker 7>spectrum including Nazi.</v>

1541
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 7>And of course that's hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 7>true.</v>

1542
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:29.020
<v Speaker 7>And if I was a Nazi then that would be </v>
<v Speaker 7>really useful for all the radical </v>

1543
01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:31.580
<v Speaker 7>leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because if you're a Nazi,</v>

1544
01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:36.581
<v Speaker 7>as Douglas has already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've already decided that you're a bad </v>

1545
01:26:36.581 --> 01:26:39.941
<v Speaker 7>person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if I was a bad person then no one </v>

1546
01:26:39.941 --> 01:26:42.641
<v Speaker 7>would have to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so it was in the interests of the </v>

1547
01:26:42.641 --> 01:26:46.661
<v Speaker 7>radicals who I was just whose positions </v>
<v Speaker 7>I was disputing to cast me as a Nazi,</v>

1548
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.120
<v Speaker 7>but it was also a reasonable cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 7>maneuver because there was some </v>

1549
01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.180
<v Speaker 7>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although it's infinitesimal,</v>

1550
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:58.181
<v Speaker 7>given the tiny proportion of actual </v>
<v Speaker 7>Nazis in our society that I would in </v>

1551
01:26:58.181 --> 01:27:02.351
<v Speaker 7>fact be one and have gotten away with </v>
<v Speaker 7>hiding that at two major universities </v>

1552
01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:05.660
<v Speaker 7>for 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And also</v>

1553
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:09.550
<v Speaker 2>awesome</v>

1554
01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:16.130
<v Speaker 7>at that point I had 250 hours of my </v>
<v Speaker 7>lectures on youtube,</v>

1555
01:27:16.201 --> 01:27:19.920
<v Speaker 7>which was basically every word in </v>
<v Speaker 7>essence that I ever uttered to a student</v>

1556
01:27:19.921 --> 01:27:24.921
<v Speaker 7>since 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And a huge part of that actually </v>

1557
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:28.131
<v Speaker 7>consisted of very trenchant criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 7>of Nazis.</v>

1558
01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.780
<v Speaker 7>So it was difficult to pin that on me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1559
01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:31.350
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

1560
01:27:31.351 --> 01:27:36.351
<v Speaker 7>but to give my critics credit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they had their reason for vilifying me.</v>

1561
01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:40.880
<v Speaker 7>And the reason was if you object,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you might be a villain.</v>

1562
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:42.100
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1563
01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:44.160
<v Speaker 7>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's steel man.</v>

1564
01:27:44.161 --> 01:27:49.161
<v Speaker 7>Number one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not at least the kind of villain </v>

1565
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 7>they think I am,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although I might be some other kind of </v>

1566
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.461
<v Speaker 7>villain altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then the next steel man issue is the </v>

1567
01:27:55.621 --> 01:27:57.990
<v Speaker 7>left has a place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1568
01:27:57.991 --> 01:27:59.520
<v Speaker 7>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1569
01:27:59.521 --> 01:28:04.080
<v Speaker 7>here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In order to act properly in the world,</v>

1570
01:28:04.081 --> 01:28:07.890
<v Speaker 7>you have to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone agrees on that and to do things</v>

1571
01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:08.640
<v Speaker 7>you have to do them.</v>

1572
01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.640
<v Speaker 7>In the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to cooperate and compete with </v>

1573
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.041
<v Speaker 7>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you cooperate and compete with </v>

1574
01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:16.080
<v Speaker 7>other people in the service of valid </v>
<v Speaker 7>goals,</v>

1575
01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:18.030
<v Speaker 7>valuable goals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>productive goals,</v>

1576
01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 7>you produce hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you produce hierarchies of competence </v>

1577
01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.450
<v Speaker 7>and hierarchies of power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those aren't exactly the same thing,</v>

1578
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 7>but either way you produce hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies,</v>

1579
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:32.630
<v Speaker 7>dispossessed people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They dispossessed people because the </v>

1580
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:36.381
<v Speaker 7>spoils go to a few.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the problem of the unequal </v>

1581
01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:39.951
<v Speaker 7>distribution of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And because in any hierarchy of </v>

1582
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:42.801
<v Speaker 7>competence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a disproportionate number of a small </v>

1583
01:28:42.801 --> 01:28:43.230
<v Speaker 7>number of people do most of the creative</v>
<v Speaker 7>work.</v>

1584
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.050
<v Speaker 7>And these are iron clad laws.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>

1585
01:28:46.051 --> 01:28:48.840
<v Speaker 7>So the problem with higher hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>are necessary,</v>

1586
01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:54.650
<v Speaker 7>but the problem with hierarchies as they</v>
<v Speaker 7>produce disposition and the left in </v>

1587
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:59.250
<v Speaker 7>principal speaks for the dispossessed </v>
<v Speaker 7>and someone has to speak for the </v>

1588
01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Speaker 7>dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so when the left,</v>

1589
01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:03.630
<v Speaker 7>he's looking at me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1590
01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:08.631
<v Speaker 7>Dr Peterson is always speaking about the</v>
<v Speaker 7>necessity of hierarchies and how can we </v>

1591
01:29:08.631 --> 01:29:12.951
<v Speaker 7>be sure that he's not trying to justify </v>
<v Speaker 7>them in their current position and </v>

1592
01:29:12.951 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 7>obscure the fact that they tend towards </v>
<v Speaker 7>tyranny and deception,</v>

1593
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:20.541
<v Speaker 7>which they clearly do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do we know that he's just not </v>

1594
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:23.900
<v Speaker 7>reifying the present power structure for</v>
<v Speaker 7>his own aims and why should we trust </v>

1595
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 7>them?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's a perfectly valid objection.</v>

1596
01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:31.220
<v Speaker 7>Now I believe it happens to be wrong </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I understand the downside of </v>

1597
01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.481
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies in and I also think I </v>
<v Speaker 7>understand how to go about rectifying </v>

1598
01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:39.261
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's why they're objecting in so </v>

1599
01:29:39.261 --> 01:29:42.051
<v Speaker 7>far as they don't as the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Insofar as they're playing a straight </v>

1600
01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:42.840
<v Speaker 7>political game and not ideological form </v>
<v Speaker 7>of grandiosity.</v>

1601
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:43.460
<v Speaker 7>Grandiosity.</v>

1602
01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So there's one of the thing in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is worth mentioning,</v>

1603
01:29:46.391 --> 01:29:49.010
<v Speaker 1>which is the perception is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1604
01:29:49.011 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>

1605
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:55.140
<v Speaker 1>aside from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say this is the center of the </v>

1606
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.140
<v Speaker 1>political access and going to have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this for you.</v>

1607
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.310
<v Speaker 1>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right.</v>

1608
01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.550
<v Speaker 1>The presumption is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cliff,</v>

1609
01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:03.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you start by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1610
01:30:03.581 --> 01:30:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I think people should pay some taxes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1611
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have that and you just go like that </v>

1612
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and then it's not Susan.</v>

1613
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And</v>

1614
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:22.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a really weird thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed because all of this look at </v>

1615
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 1>all of this is just the footnote still </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century and we're still trying </v>

1616
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.110
<v Speaker 1>to work out what happened and why and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1617
01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And in the history books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the period we're living,</v>

1618
01:30:32.261 --> 01:30:36.380
<v Speaker 1>it will be the post Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post World War Two posts,</v>

1619
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:41.400
<v Speaker 1>ghoulag world when they were still </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sort out what happened behind </v>

1620
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.820
<v Speaker 1>the crime scene tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1621
01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So on the left there's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing which is that you can </v>

1622
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:52.441
<v Speaker 1>go pretty much all the way like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all there's not a very wide </v>

1623
01:30:53.291 --> 01:30:57.340
<v Speaker 1>recognition that you had the gulag not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not very much known about that.</v>

1624
01:30:57.341 --> 01:30:59.240
<v Speaker 1>People don't read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't read it.</v>

1625
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:01.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go pretty far left.</v>

1626
01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You just hit the vegans.</v>

1627
01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 8>But there's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you might be like radical</v>

1628
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:11.330
<v Speaker 1>your fan this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1629
01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what happened on that </v>

1630
01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:16.770
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse than that.</v>

1631
01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:18.820
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a young girl,</v>

1632
01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:23.821
<v Speaker 1>a commentator on the TV and the London a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of mornings ago arguing about </v>

1633
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:26.590
<v Speaker 1>trump and so on is a usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very enlightening discussion.</v>

1634
01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.020
<v Speaker 1>He's arguing with Piers Morgan and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1635
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep on saying,</v>

1636
01:31:30.011 --> 01:31:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm a supporter of Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1637
01:31:32.921 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a communist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1638
01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally a communist thought if </v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl had said you knew you should </v>

1639
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.410
<v Speaker 1>be more careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally a fascist,</v>

1640
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1641
01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.160
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>By the way,</v>

1642
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I did that one carefully on that.</v>

1643
01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:49.780
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

1644
01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:57.700
<v Speaker 8>I'm alive to Youtube New York Times</v>

1645
01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:58.840
<v Speaker 1>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1646
01:31:59.300 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1647
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:04.320
<v Speaker 7>Little Fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if he's got,</v>

1648
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:08.020
<v Speaker 7>not everyone is busy searching around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in Canada,</v>

1649
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 7>the one of the big discussion forums,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1650
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:15.781
<v Speaker 7>the human rights commissions found that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there were like 11 people on this Neo </v>

1651
01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:19.890
<v Speaker 7>Nazi forum and it turned out half of </v>
<v Speaker 7>them were working for the Canadian </v>

1652
01:32:19.890 --> 01:32:22.531
<v Speaker 7>government trying to find me or not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Canadian government constituted 50 </v>

1653
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 7>percent of the Neo Nazis in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're scurrying around looking for the</v>

1654
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:32.791
<v Speaker 7>Nazis like this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and on the other side it's like </v>

1655
01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:32.791
<v Speaker 7>mainstream or the television.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1656
01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 7>I'm a communist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd love to go through that again.</v>

1657
01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.370
<v Speaker 7>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's another problem.</v>

1658
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.320
<v Speaker 7>This is a really interesting problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1659
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.400
<v Speaker 7>so you brought up two things and one is </v>
<v Speaker 7>no one knows about what happened in </v>

1660
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.160
<v Speaker 7>Mao's China or what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Soviet Union,</v>

1661
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 7>which is absolutely appalling because we</v>
<v Speaker 7>should all know that.</v>

1662
01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 7>And so there's obviously a cliff on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>left side.</v>

1663
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.420
<v Speaker 7>Now I would say actually there is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibility that as you move farther out</v>

1664
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 7>on each end of the political spectrum,</v>

1665
01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.710
<v Speaker 9>the rate at which you deteriorate </v>
<v Speaker 9>accelerate.</v>

1666
01:33:01.711 --> 01:33:03.560
<v Speaker 9>So it's not linear.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's possible.</v>

1667
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:07.400
<v Speaker 9>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's also the case on the left.</v>

1668
01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.590
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the things we could say is,</v>

1669
01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:15.040
<v Speaker 9>well those idiot leftists should get </v>
<v Speaker 9>their house in order because they won't </v>

1670
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.090
<v Speaker 9>differentiate themselves from their </v>
<v Speaker 9>radical brethren.</v>

1671
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:19.280
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so now we might ask,</v>

1672
01:33:19.281 --> 01:33:22.070
<v Speaker 9>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 9>We might ask two things.</v>

1673
01:33:22.071 --> 01:33:25.100
<v Speaker 9>Why and whose problem is that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1674
01:33:25.101 --> 01:33:27.890
<v Speaker 9>So the first issue of why is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1675
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:31.190
<v Speaker 9>people who are left leaning have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 9>time drawing boundaries.</v>

1676
01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 9>That's what makes them left leaning and </v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean this technically because left </v>

1677
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:41.561
<v Speaker 9>leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people are high in openness to </v>

1678
01:33:41.561 --> 01:33:43.181
<v Speaker 9>experience which is a creativity trait.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they like information flow and they </v>

1679
01:33:43.181 --> 01:33:45.980
<v Speaker 9>don't like borders between things and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they tend to be low in orderliness.</v>

1680
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:49.220
<v Speaker 9>So disorder doesn't discuss an upset.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1681
01:33:49.221 --> 01:33:51.980
<v Speaker 9>So they can't draw boundaries and that's</v>
<v Speaker 9>why they're on the left.</v>

1682
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 9>But boundaries have their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there's some utility in people who </v>

1683
01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 9>don't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1684
01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:01.330
<v Speaker 9>But the second problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and this isn't a problem that's only </v>

1685
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:06.550
<v Speaker 9>Germane to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's the problem of the dam 20th </v>

1686
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:07.040
<v Speaker 9>century.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like okay,</v>

1687
01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.700
<v Speaker 9>when does the left go too far?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the answer is nobody knows.</v>

1688
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:16.400
<v Speaker 9>Like with the right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can tell man,</v>

1689
01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:20.090
<v Speaker 9>it's like they make a claim of ethnic or</v>
<v Speaker 9>racial superiority.</v>

1690
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:23.890
<v Speaker 9>It's like box Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1691
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 9>And then you can see that this happens </v>
<v Speaker 9>because even back in the seventies when </v>

1692
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.690
<v Speaker 9>William f Buckley was sort of a leading </v>
<v Speaker 9>conservative,</v>

1693
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:34.310
<v Speaker 9>he put a box around the Ku Klux Klan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the John Birch types and he said,</v>

1694
01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.400
<v Speaker 9>I'm not you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but none of that's happening on the </v>

1695
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:39.400
<v Speaker 9>left.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

1696
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.850
<v Speaker 9>why?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1697
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:42.560
<v Speaker 9>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1698
01:34:42.561 --> 01:34:44.360
<v Speaker 9>we stand for diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

1699
01:34:44.361 --> 01:34:47.060
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>everyone likes diversity and well,</v>

1700
01:34:47.061 --> 01:34:49.130
<v Speaker 9>what about inclusivity?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Damn right,</v>

1701
01:34:49.131 --> 01:34:50.510
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's include some people.</v>

1702
01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.530
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what about,</v>

1703
01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.660
<v Speaker 9>what about equality?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That'd be good.</v>

1704
01:34:53.661 --> 01:34:55.310
<v Speaker 9>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's have so many quality.</v>

1705
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:56.750
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

1706
01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 9>well how he quality.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Exactly.</v>

1707
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 9>Well then it's gradations,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1708
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>equality of opportunity.</v>

1709
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.240
<v Speaker 9>Damn straight.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Equality of outcome.</v>

1710
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:11.380
<v Speaker 9>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>How about no under no circumstances </v>

1711
01:35:12.111 --> 01:35:14.020
<v Speaker 9>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you know I can</v>

1712
01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You get somebody,</v>

1713
01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 9>you get somebody saying race or </v>
<v Speaker 9>ethnicity.</v>

1714
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:29.770
<v Speaker 9>Group member x is detestable because of </v>
<v Speaker 9>their group identity and you think evil </v>

1715
01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:31.400
<v Speaker 9>Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but then you see someone saying,</v>

1716
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 9>well I just wish that everybody could </v>
<v Speaker 9>have an equal outcome.</v>

1717
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:36.500
<v Speaker 9>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're going to are going to punch them.</v>

1718
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 9>It's what you're supposed to do with </v>
<v Speaker 9>Nazis.</v>

1719
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.220
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're not.</v>

1720
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.150
<v Speaker 9>You're going to take hold.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's a pretty nice person.</v>

1721
01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:46.151
<v Speaker 9>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>just because you're nice doesn't mean </v>

1722
01:35:46.151 --> 01:35:48.971
<v Speaker 9>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And just because you stand for equality </v>

1723
01:35:48.971 --> 01:35:48.971
<v Speaker 9>of outcome doesn't mean</v>

1724
01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:52.220
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is</v>

1725
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:56.030
<v Speaker 9>complex technical problem,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1726
01:35:56.031 --> 01:36:01.031
<v Speaker 9>Because it looks like you need a </v>
<v Speaker 9>multivariate equation to define </v>

1727
01:36:01.031 --> 01:36:02.030
<v Speaker 9>pathology on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like,</v>

1728
01:36:02.031 --> 01:36:05.030
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you believe this and this and this in</v>

1729
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:08.870
<v Speaker 9>and to disproportionately,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then we have to put a box around you.</v>

1730
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:14.350
<v Speaker 9>But it's not like someone wears a symbol</v>
<v Speaker 9>on their damn shirt or tattooed onto </v>

1731
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 9>their face that enables you to identify </v>
<v Speaker 9>them.</v>

1732
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 9>So we have a real structural problem </v>
<v Speaker 9>here.</v>

1733
01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 9>We don't know how to box in pathology on</v>
<v Speaker 9>the left.</v>

1734
01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.120
<v Speaker 9>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 9>including the moderate leftist,</v>

1735
01:36:25.121 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 9>but none of us know.</v>

1736
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:31.450
<v Speaker 6>An additional problem is that any of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these issues may not have a solution </v>

1737
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:34.850
<v Speaker 6>that we can happily live with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1738
01:36:34.851 --> 01:36:36.770
<v Speaker 6>So it'd be takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's sharpen this up.</v>

1739
01:36:36.771 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 6>And this was more in the interest of </v>
<v Speaker 6>steel manning our critics.</v>

1740
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:43.730
<v Speaker 6>You take a problem like immigration </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now,</v>

1741
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:44.310
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1742
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:47.120
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the intuition that's driving the left.</v>

1743
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:51.050
<v Speaker 6>Let's take the extreme case of an open </v>
<v Speaker 6>borders ethic.</v>

1744
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:56.510
<v Speaker 6>Borders are illegitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Borders are a principal,</v>

1745
01:36:56.990 --> 01:37:01.990
<v Speaker 6>a of of selfishness and xenophobia and </v>
<v Speaker 6>and unearned privilege,</v>

1746
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:10.030
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of us can take credit for the fact </v>

1747
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:12.701
<v Speaker 6>that we were born into the societies </v>
<v Speaker 6>were born into a and yet we have all of </v>

1748
01:37:12.701 --> 01:37:17.291
<v Speaker 6>the advantages of having been born there</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so it is with with all of you and </v>

1749
01:37:17.291 --> 01:37:21.721
<v Speaker 6>the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of us are currently living through </v>

1750
01:37:21.721 --> 01:37:24.950
<v Speaker 6>the civil war in Syria now and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>good thing for all of us.</v>

1751
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 6>And so the concern here is that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment you say,</v>

1752
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>immigration is potentially a problem,</v>

1753
01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:34.310
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Immigrate.</v>

1754
01:37:34.311 --> 01:37:39.311
<v Speaker 6>We can't just throw open the borders to </v>
<v Speaker 6>all of humanity because what would </v>

1755
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:45.131
<v Speaker 6>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would happen is people would </v>

1756
01:37:45.131 --> 01:37:46.390
<v Speaker 6>continue to cross those borders until </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1757
01:37:46.391 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 6>the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1758
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:52.571
<v Speaker 6>of wellbeing in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the developed world diminished so </v>

1759
01:37:52.571 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 6>much that there was no reason to cross </v>
<v Speaker 6>the borders anymore.</v>

1760
01:37:55.710 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be,</v>

1761
01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 6>they would just say some principle of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Osmosis.</v>

1762
01:37:58.490 --> 01:38:02.060
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>So it's even.</v>

1763
01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 10>It's even worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the concern is that this is</v>

1764
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:11.050
<v Speaker 6>totally ethically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a totally illegitimate situation</v>

1765
01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:17.580
<v Speaker 6>and to shine a bright enough light on </v>
<v Speaker 6>any particular story in Syria,</v>

1766
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:20.750
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you just give me the right family</v>

1767
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.500
<v Speaker 6>with children and I learned enough about</v>
<v Speaker 6>them and their plight and I recognize </v>

1768
01:38:26.781 --> 01:38:31.781
<v Speaker 6>within 30 seconds that if I were them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would be desperate to get to Dublin or</v>

1769
01:38:32.931 --> 01:38:36.590
<v Speaker 6>New York or San Francisco or anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>but Syria.</v>

1770
01:38:36.730 --> 01:38:41.730
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it seems like a completely,</v>

1771
01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1772
01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:49.290
<v Speaker 6>it seems evil to in any way perpetuate </v>
<v Speaker 6>this lottery where you pulled a bad </v>

1773
01:38:51.311 --> 01:38:53.050
<v Speaker 6>ticket and sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

1774
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.410
<v Speaker 6>This defines the rest of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the lives of your children.</v>

1775
01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:57.860
<v Speaker 6>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1776
01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:01.720
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no bright line where any of us,</v>

1777
01:39:01.721 --> 01:39:02.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1778
01:39:02.141 --> 01:39:07.141
<v Speaker 6>meaning people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wherever we are in the political </v>

1779
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:07.141
<v Speaker 6>spectrum or wherever we are in any other</v>
<v Speaker 6>question,</v>

1780
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.200
<v Speaker 6>there's no bright line where we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Aha,</v>

1781
01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the solution that we know is ethical,</v>

1782
01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 6>that we know we can defend against all </v>
<v Speaker 6>comers and it can survive every test of </v>

1783
01:39:19.931 --> 01:39:24.931
<v Speaker 6>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just goes straight to the power of </v>

1784
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:24.931
<v Speaker 6>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You tell it,</v>

1785
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:28.771
<v Speaker 6>you tell people a compelling enough </v>
<v Speaker 6>story about one little girl and it </v>

1786
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:32.941
<v Speaker 6>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Policy isn't not what happened to </v>

1787
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:32.941
<v Speaker 6>Angola.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Merkel,</v>

1788
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:35.920
<v Speaker 6>she was faced with one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one d denied refugee and all of a sudden</v>

1789
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 6>the policy for Europe changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1790
01:39:38.671 --> 01:39:39.700
<v Speaker 6>and so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1791
01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:44.701
<v Speaker 6>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying there's a solution to </v>

1792
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:44.701
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is the fear,</v>

1793
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:44.701
<v Speaker 6>the fear that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an,</v>

1794
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:47.180
<v Speaker 6>there's an imputation of callousness on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the part of.</v>

1795
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:49.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm speaking specifically to you </v>
<v Speaker 6>Douglas,</v>

1796
01:39:49.451 --> 01:39:51.040
<v Speaker 6>because it's been your issue more than </v>
<v Speaker 6>ours.</v>

1797
01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.470
<v Speaker 6>How callous must you be to be worrying </v>
<v Speaker 6>about immigration?</v>

1798
01:39:56.530 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 6>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's obviously there's a counter </v>

1799
01:40:01.530 --> 01:40:02.230
<v Speaker 6>argument from the right side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there is a,</v>

1800
01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:05.590
<v Speaker 6>there's an ethical core to it that is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's difficult to dismiss.</v>

1801
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is something which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not just that issues almost </v>

1802
01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:13.311
<v Speaker 1>every issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking a bit about this dinner </v>

1803
01:40:13.311 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that we seem to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1804
01:40:14.251 --> 01:40:19.251
<v Speaker 1>we just aren't ready for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications age women and we're just </v>

1805
01:40:19.561 --> 01:40:22.710
<v Speaker 1>not ready for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are not yet able to cope.</v>

1806
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1807
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the notion of private and public speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just basically evaporated so that</v>

1808
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.760
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem,</v>

1809
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:38.300
<v Speaker 1>try out an idea with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just throw around an idea.</v>

1810
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>We've all done it for around ideas with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>

1811
01:40:42.031 --> 01:40:45.120
<v Speaker 1>If even one person is videoing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>might post it,</v>

1812
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:47.810
<v Speaker 1>this is what is the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all in it.</v>

1813
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:50.640
<v Speaker 1>It's too dangerous to try things out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1814
01:40:50.641 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Most people have no borders and</v>

1815
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 1>so this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are always vulnerable that are,</v>

1816
01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people in Europe,</v>

1817
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.260
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one borders.</v>

1818
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean like overwhelming majority in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every country want there to be borders,</v>

1819
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you show them footage of somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>being turned away at the border that </v>

1820
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

1821
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:12.690
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1822
01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:17.740
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have abstract principles we need to </v>

1823
01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.281
<v Speaker 1>abide by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to abide by everybody wants to </v>

1824
01:41:20.281 --> 01:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know what to do in this </v>

1825
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>precisely this era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we've just got to,</v>

1826
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:27.451
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and all sorts of ways to find ways </v>

1827
01:41:27.451 --> 01:41:31.711
<v Speaker 1>to think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a deeper than the ones we've managed </v>

1828
01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:31.711
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

1829
01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:35.431
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to cope with the idea of being </v>

1830
01:41:35.431 --> 01:41:38.490
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've got unbelievable luck and then</v>

1831
01:41:40.271 --> 01:41:43.450
<v Speaker 1>the questions from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm lucky,</v>

1832
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I priorities?</v>

1833
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 7>What am my obligation?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What am I lucky?</v>

1834
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 7>What are my obligations?</v>

1835
01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my obligation is to share my home with </v>

1836
01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1837
01:41:56.390 --> 01:42:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's because I know lots of </v>

1838
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.470
<v Speaker 1>people who've taken in a refugee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1839
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have unbelievable admiration for </v>

1840
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:07.500
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really working the walk,</v>

1841
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different thing</v>

1842
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:12.470
<v Speaker 6>called your bluff when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see you taking in refugees into </v>

1843
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.470
<v Speaker 6>your home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they said,</v>

1844
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.470
<v Speaker 6>oh actually there's one of the.</v>

1845
01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.270
<v Speaker 7>I always wanted to turn up to their </v>
<v Speaker 7>houses with some refugees.</v>

1846
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 7>Say I've got yours and go there also </v>
<v Speaker 7>aren't 50 in the living room.</v>

1847
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:22.700
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1848
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.160
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so let's,</v>

1849
01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:26.920
<v Speaker 7>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's elaborate on this a bit more.</v>

1850
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the issue is borders exclude,</v>

1851
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:33.460
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a postmodern proposition,</v>

1852
01:42:33.461 --> 01:42:36.010
<v Speaker 7>or maybe you can take that even further </v>
<v Speaker 7>than borders,</v>

1853
01:42:36.011 --> 01:42:38.530
<v Speaker 7>excluding privileged those within the </v>
<v Speaker 7>borders.</v>

1854
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

1855
01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so let's take that seriously.</v>

1856
01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 7>Now I'm part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Seriousness is poor.</v>

1857
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:48.190
<v Speaker 7>Innocent children are hurt at borders.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That happens all the time.</v>

1858
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:50.410
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The question is,</v>

1859
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.160
<v Speaker 7>are you willing to give up the borders?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

1860
01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 7>let's think about what borders are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your skin is a border,</v>

1861
01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and your prejudice in protection of your</v>

1862
01:43:03.071 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 7>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>

1863
01:43:04.241 --> 01:43:09.241
<v Speaker 7>you won't just sleep with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You reserve the right to keep that </v>

1864
01:43:09.241 --> 01:43:10.600
<v Speaker 7>border in tact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1865
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:13.630
<v Speaker 7>And to be choosy about the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 7>which it's broached,</v>

1866
01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.300
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you likely have a bedroom.</v>

1867
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.210
<v Speaker 7>It probably has walls.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have clothing,</v>

1868
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 7>you have a house,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have a town,</v>

1869
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:24.790
<v Speaker 7>you have a state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have a country,</v>

1870
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:27.730
<v Speaker 7>and those are all borders.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's borders within borders,</v>

1871
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:29.110
<v Speaker 7>within borders,</v>
<v Speaker 7>without borders,</v>

1872
01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:32.320
<v Speaker 7>and you need those borders because </v>
<v Speaker 7>otherwise you will die,</v>

1873
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:38.340
<v Speaker 7>so we could not be too hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 7>about the damn borders is like we don't </v>

1874
01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:41.800
<v Speaker 7>know how to organize fragile things </v>
<v Speaker 7>without putting boundaries around them.</v>

1875
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 7>When you see that in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1876
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 7>As soon as people realize that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>sneaking in little religion here in </v>

1877
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:51.661
<v Speaker 7>case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as soon as people realize they become </v>

1878
01:43:51.661 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 7>self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they wake</v>

1879
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.160
<v Speaker 9>up and realize their vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The first thing they do is manufacturer </v>

1880
01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 9>a border between them and the world and </v>
<v Speaker 9>we need borders between us and the world</v>

1881
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 9>and we pay a bloody price for borders </v>
<v Speaker 9>and I say those words very carefully.</v>

1882
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:09.610
<v Speaker 9>We play.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Pay a bloody price for borders and it's </v>

1883
01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.270
<v Speaker 9>often in the price of other people's </v>
<v Speaker 9>blood and so then the question might be,</v>

1884
01:44:11.271 --> 01:44:16.271
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how should you conduct yourself </v>

1885
01:44:16.271 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 9>ethically in a world where other people </v>
<v Speaker 9>are paying in blood for your borders?</v>

1886
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:22.510
<v Speaker 9>And the answer that I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 9>communicate to people is get your damn </v>

1887
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 9>house in order.</v>
<v Speaker 9>As much responsibility as you can,</v>

1888
01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:27.950
<v Speaker 9>act as effectively as you can as an </v>
<v Speaker 9>individual in the world.</v>

1889
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 9>Because then you can justify your </v>
<v Speaker 9>privilege.</v>

1890
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:36.050
<v Speaker 9>You can justify your luck and your good </v>
<v Speaker 9>fortune and maybe within the confines of</v>

1891
01:44:36.051 --> 01:44:41.051
<v Speaker 9>your border you can be more productive </v>
<v Speaker 9>and useful than you would be in the </v>

1892
01:44:41.051 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 9>absolute absence of borders altogether.</v>

1893
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:46.970
<v Speaker 9>And it seems to me that that's the case </v>
<v Speaker 9>and then we have to have a discussion.</v>

1894
01:44:46.971 --> 01:44:51.971
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the left doesn't like borders and the </v>

1895
01:44:51.971 --> 01:44:52.370
<v Speaker 9>right is more fond of them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 9>both right.</v>

1896
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.580
<v Speaker 9>And so because we don't know how strict </v>
<v Speaker 9>the borders should be,</v>

1897
01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 9>all how permeable it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It shouldn't be absolute,</v>

1898
01:44:58.101 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 9>so nothing moves between borders and </v>
<v Speaker 9>everything dies them.</v>

1899
01:45:01.821 --> 01:45:04.460
<v Speaker 9>But if the borders disappeared then we </v>
<v Speaker 9>can't survive.</v>

1900
01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 9>So we have to have a discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 9>borders all the time.</v>

1901
01:45:07.251 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 9>And that's partly that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's partly what we're doing here.</v>

1902
01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 9>We have to be more sophisticated</v>

1903
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:17.500
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people end up getting held </v>

1904
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.650
<v Speaker 1>accountable for their own use in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter as an amongst so many others.</v>

1905
01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:26.250
<v Speaker 1>There's an enormous amount to gain by </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something that's wrong and </v>

1906
01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:29.920
<v Speaker 1>there's very little to gain by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is right on this.</v>

1907
01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just.</v>

1908
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.830
<v Speaker 6>Just a world of suffering and look</v>

1909
01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 1>problem with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

1910
01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:43.420
<v Speaker 1>this is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your area of politics more than </v>

1911
01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:46.991
<v Speaker 1>it is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these lines that are being put down </v>

1912
01:45:46.991 --> 01:45:48.170
<v Speaker 1>on the left at the moment of which this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one,</v>

1913
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:54.430
<v Speaker 1>these other ones that are now coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see today's one,</v>

1914
01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't act a role that you're on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1915
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:03.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't pretend to be someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a brand new rule.</v>

1916
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a Scarlett Johansson </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was cast in the film as a trans</v>

1917
01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.520
<v Speaker 6>for transgender woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Amanda Woman,</v>

1918
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:17.650
<v Speaker 6>it might've been the other way around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's scarcely matters.</v>

1919
01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it matches.</v>

1920
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:23.910
<v Speaker 6>That's your fascist movements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's my privilege.</v>

1921
01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 9>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because that's actually a boundary to.</v>

1922
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:32.590
<v Speaker 9>That's actually a border to it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it's another case where these things </v>

1923
01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:33.740
<v Speaker 9>reverse in a perverse manner.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like where did that one</v>

1924
01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.240
<v Speaker 1>come from?</v>

1925
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:40.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well it probably came from the west </v>

1926
01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:40.180
<v Speaker 6>coast.</v>

1927
01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1928
01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.220
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

1929
01:46:46.221 --> 01:46:51.221
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me that we need to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 6>get comfortable with the increasingly </v>

1930
01:46:55.831 --> 01:47:00.831
<v Speaker 6>public moments of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of uncertainty on topics like this </v>

1931
01:47:00.831 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 6>because so much of so much of safety and</v>
<v Speaker 6>reputational safety,</v>

1932
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.500
<v Speaker 6>as you were just alluding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is predicated in the public sphere in </v>

1933
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:16.550
<v Speaker 6>either pretending to be certain or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or false sleeping certain on a safe </v>

1934
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:22.431
<v Speaker 6>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a safe and wrong answer to a </v>

1935
01:47:22.431 --> 01:47:22.431
<v Speaker 6>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All</v>

1936
01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.590
<v Speaker 9>part of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is,</v>

1937
01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.460
<v Speaker 9>is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

1938
01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:30.730
<v Speaker 9>the pathology of basal instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so because the rule now is if I feel</v>

1939
01:47:32.481 --> 01:47:34.190
<v Speaker 9>sorry for you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm good.</v>

1940
01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:35.990
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>

1941
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:41.050
<v Speaker 9>so let's say there's a complex situation</v>
<v Speaker 9>that requires a tremendous amount of </v>

1942
01:47:41.050 --> 01:47:46.000
<v Speaker 9>adult cognitive computation to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like what do we do about the borders?</v>

1943
01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.310
<v Speaker 9>Because tearing them down is not the </v>
<v Speaker 9>answer.</v>

1944
01:47:49.610 --> 01:47:52.130
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the person who stands up and says,</v>

1945
01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:54.860
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I see someone who's hurt by a border and</v>

1946
01:47:54.861 --> 01:47:57.710
<v Speaker 9>I feel empathy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then immediately says,</v>

1947
01:47:57.830 --> 01:48:01.100
<v Speaker 9>therefore I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which isn't so bad,</v>

1948
01:48:01.130 --> 01:48:04.790
<v Speaker 9>but therefore I'm also morally superior </v>
<v Speaker 9>to you.</v>

1949
01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:10.210
<v Speaker 9>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is one of the true pathologies of </v>

1950
01:48:10.210 --> 01:48:12.230
<v Speaker 9>the empathic collectivists is that they </v>
<v Speaker 9>presume that they reflects of empathy,</v>

1951
01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.800
<v Speaker 9>marks them out as morally superior,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's appalling because part of it </v>

1952
01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.380
<v Speaker 9>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's too easy.</v>

1953
01:48:18.381 --> 01:48:23.381
<v Speaker 9>Just because I feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't mean I'm good partly because </v>

1954
01:48:23.381 --> 01:48:26.620
<v Speaker 9>I can feel so sorry for you that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 9>actually harmful to you and that's what </v>

1955
01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.070
<v Speaker 9>happens in the case of over protective </v>
<v Speaker 9>parents,</v>

1956
01:48:28.071 --> 01:48:30.050
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so we know perfectly well</v>

1957
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 9>that empathy is not an untrammeled moral</v>
<v Speaker 9>virtue.</v>

1958
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:41.571
<v Speaker 9>It has to be tempered by other virtues </v>
<v Speaker 9>and carefully tempered by other virtues </v>

1959
01:48:41.571 --> 01:48:46.400
<v Speaker 9>and so we have to stop allowing in our </v>
<v Speaker 9>public discourse the unquestioned </v>

1960
01:48:46.441 --> 01:48:51.441
<v Speaker 9>assumption that just because I manifest </v>
<v Speaker 9>more pity in the moment than you do that</v>

1961
01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:54.340
<v Speaker 9>I'm somehow morally superior </v>
<v Speaker 9>individually.</v>

1962
01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.190
<v Speaker 9>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not only do we have to question that,</v>

1963
01:48:56.191 --> 01:49:00.210
<v Speaker 9>we fact have to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We have to deeply question it and say,</v>

1964
01:49:00.630 --> 01:49:05.630
<v Speaker 9>what makes you think that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That you're just not taking things too </v>

1965
01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:09.501
<v Speaker 9>far right there because there's just as </v>
<v Speaker 9>much error on the side of too much </v>

1966
01:49:09.501 --> 01:49:13.371
<v Speaker 9>empathy as there is on the side of too </v>
<v Speaker 9>little empathy and that's a hard thing </v>

1967
01:49:13.371 --> 01:49:14.280
<v Speaker 9>for everyone to learn because empathy </v>
<v Speaker 9>feels so good.</v>

1968
01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.630
<v Speaker 9>Like if you feel mercy towards us </v>
<v Speaker 9>suffering child,</v>

1969
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 9>it's like that is kind of an indication </v>
<v Speaker 9>that you're an ethical person,</v>

1970
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.360
<v Speaker 9>but that's not the basis for complex and</v>
<v Speaker 9>sophisticated foreign policy.</v>

1971
01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it isn't because</v>

1972
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1973
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:39.850
<v Speaker 6>we know our empathy diminishes it almost</v>
<v Speaker 6>linear way with the numbers of people to</v>

1974
01:49:42.771 --> 01:49:44.090
<v Speaker 6>empathize with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1975
01:49:44.091 --> 01:49:46.850
<v Speaker 6>So how we spoke about this one night in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Vancouver,</v>

1976
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:52.140
<v Speaker 6>but this has been tested.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where did you tell someone about the </v>

1977
01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:55.801
<v Speaker 6>plight of one little girl?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You will elicit the maximum empathic </v>

1978
01:49:55.801 --> 01:50:00.181
<v Speaker 6>response and the Mat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The maximum of an altruistic response </v>

1979
01:50:00.181 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 6>that they'll get the most amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>money they're going to give to any cause</v>

1980
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:04.540
<v Speaker 6>to one compelling story to save one </v>
<v Speaker 6>little boy or girl,</v>

1981
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.960
<v Speaker 6>but if you start adding boys and girls </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the to the one keeping the one the </v>

1982
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.771
<v Speaker 6>same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people's empathy degrades and their </v>

1983
01:50:13.771 --> 01:50:13.771
<v Speaker 6>actual at their altruism degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1984
01:50:13.771 --> 01:50:17.250
<v Speaker 6>So empathy is non quantitative almost by</v>
<v Speaker 6>definition.</v>

1985
01:50:17.251 --> 01:50:17.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1986
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:22.310
<v Speaker 9>It's also partly because in your life if</v>
<v Speaker 9>you see a person in trouble,</v>

1987
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:28.320
<v Speaker 9>something,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but if you see 100 million people in </v>

1988
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.731
<v Speaker 9>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what you should probably do at least to </v>

1989
01:50:31.731 --> 01:50:33.140
<v Speaker 9>begin with is run and what are you going</v>
<v Speaker 9>to do it?</v>

1990
01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.500
<v Speaker 9>Maybe you could give a thousand dollars </v>
<v Speaker 9>to one person,</v>

1991
01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.790
<v Speaker 9>but if you divided that up among a </v>
<v Speaker 9>million,</v>

1992
01:50:38.850 --> 01:50:40.040
<v Speaker 9>all of that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Would you?</v>

1993
01:50:40.041 --> 01:50:45.041
<v Speaker 9>Would you wouldn't be have.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You would have no money and they </v>

1994
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:45.041
<v Speaker 9>wouldn't be any better off.</v>

1995
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:45.041
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1996
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:49.900
<v Speaker 6>but this is just say that so much of of </v>
<v Speaker 6>moral progress today entails unhooking </v>

1997
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:58.030
<v Speaker 6>from the highly salient empathy driving </v>
<v Speaker 6>story and connecting with the actual </v>

1998
01:50:59.811 --> 01:51:03.920
<v Speaker 6>quantitative reality to learn that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>500,000</v>

1999
01:51:03.921 --> 01:51:07.970
<v Speaker 6>people dying every year from heart </v>
<v Speaker 6>disease or whatever it is,</v>

2000
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:10.850
<v Speaker 6>or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this is 500,000</v>

2001
01:51:10.851 --> 01:51:15.851
<v Speaker 6>people dying for this family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that that that can't be made </v>

2002
01:51:15.861 --> 01:51:18.470
<v Speaker 6>sexy for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for our news cycle,</v>

2003
01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:23.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that we lose attention is </v>

2004
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:23.500
<v Speaker 6>something we have to figure out how to</v>

2005
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.790
<v Speaker 9>and also it can.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very interestingly akin to your </v>

2006
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:28.580
<v Speaker 9>objection that you raised before is that</v>
<v Speaker 9>there are,</v>

2007
01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:33.620
<v Speaker 9>there are adult forms of solving </v>
<v Speaker 9>problems that aren't akin to children's </v>

2008
01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:33.850
<v Speaker 9>play,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is something by the way,</v>

2009
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:38.851
<v Speaker 9>I agree with because I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 9>the manner in which children organized </v>

2010
01:51:38.851 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 9>the world is the end of the way that </v>
<v Speaker 9>things should be organized.</v>

2011
01:51:40.631 --> 01:51:42.850
<v Speaker 9>It's the basis for some of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>organization,</v>

2012
01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:47.851
<v Speaker 9>but this is akin to the same issue,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that the basal motivational </v>

2013
01:51:48.161 --> 01:51:53.161
<v Speaker 9>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the emotional response is no matter how </v>

2014
01:51:53.161 --> 01:51:55.771
<v Speaker 9>well meaning aren't sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 9>conceptual sophistication to deal with </v>

2015
01:51:55.781 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 9>incredibly elaborate and complex systems</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then you have another problem too,</v>

2016
01:51:59.771 --> 01:52:00.550
<v Speaker 9>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

2017
01:52:00.551 --> 01:52:05.551
<v Speaker 9>that's really troublesome for people </v>
<v Speaker 9>because they want to do the right thing </v>

2018
01:52:05.551 --> 01:52:06.220
<v Speaker 9>globally and then you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>

2019
01:52:06.221 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 9>you don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't know how to take this insanely</v>

2020
01:52:10.151 --> 01:52:13.300
<v Speaker 9>complicated system that we have and </v>
<v Speaker 9>improve it,</v>

2021
01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:18.360
<v Speaker 9>and just because you're feeling pity </v>
<v Speaker 9>doesn't mean that you're an expert in </v>

2022
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.530
<v Speaker 9>the retooling of hydroelectric systems.</v>
<v Speaker 9>For example,</v>

2023
01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:22.990
<v Speaker 9>and this one has one straightforward way</v>
<v Speaker 9>to do that.</v>

2024
01:52:22.991 --> 01:52:24.520
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>given the example,</v>

2025
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:30.670
<v Speaker 9>there's a Kurdish demographer who lives,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who's Swedish citizen now who cited this</v>

2026
01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:35.671
<v Speaker 9>fact that it costs the same amount one </v>
<v Speaker 9>refugee and keep them in Sweden as it </v>

2027
01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:40.060
<v Speaker 9>does to look after 100 refugees in </v>
<v Speaker 9>Jordan,</v>

2028
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:42.300
<v Speaker 9>Turkey or Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay?</v>

2029
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:44.290
<v Speaker 9>So the obvious thing from that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you say,</v>

2030
01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:45.600
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's madness</v>

2031
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:47.390
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

2032
01:52:47.391 --> 01:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>bringing in thousands of refugees to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden.</v>

2033
01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:52.940
<v Speaker 1>You could be looking after hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people in the region.</v>

2034
01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Why is that still a tainted argument is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people aren't sure.</v>

2035
01:52:56.601 --> 01:52:59.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to smuggle in racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

2036
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're not just coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this democracy stuff in order like </v>

2037
01:53:04.930 --> 01:53:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you're smuggling in Hitler just typed </v>
<v Speaker 1>smuggling Jesus.</v>

2038
01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start with NGO figures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and before we know it,</v>

2039
01:53:10.101 --> 01:53:12.100
<v Speaker 1>it's outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think.</v>

2040
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:17.800
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the shortcut solution to </v>

2041
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:21.491
<v Speaker 1>answering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every single one of these </v>

2042
01:53:21.491 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 1>problems is assume that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interlocutor has good motives,</v>

2043
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:28.130
<v Speaker 1>that they are being on this in the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're looking at it</v>

2044
01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:31.200
<v Speaker 8>and that's when I say comments about </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

2045
01:53:31.201 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so</v>

2046
01:53:31.630 --> 01:53:34.450
<v Speaker 9>this is something I deal with in my </v>
<v Speaker 9>clinical practice all the time.</v>

2047
01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:39.960
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So imagine that you're naive and then </v>

2048
01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.520
<v Speaker 9>what you are when you're naive as </v>
<v Speaker 9>someone who thinks you trust people </v>

2049
01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.300
<v Speaker 9>because you think everybody has good </v>
<v Speaker 9>motivations,</v>

2050
01:53:46.301 --> 01:53:50.020
<v Speaker 9>which is some sense with douglass is a </v>
<v Speaker 9>recommended it and I'd say,</v>

2051
01:53:50.021 --> 01:53:51.350
<v Speaker 9>well that's just naive.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

2052
01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:55.000
<v Speaker 9>just wait a second though because here's</v>
<v Speaker 9>the developmental pathway.</v>

2053
01:53:55.420 --> 01:54:00.420
<v Speaker 9>First year naive and you trust everyone </v>
<v Speaker 9>and then someone cuts you off at the </v>

2054
01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:04.321
<v Speaker 9>knees or multiple people do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>or maybe you cut yourself off at the </v>

2055
01:54:04.321 --> 01:54:07.891
<v Speaker 9>knees because you trusted yourself too </v>
<v Speaker 9>much and you didn't take into account </v>

2056
01:54:07.891 --> 01:54:10.060
<v Speaker 9>the malevolence that lurks in your heart</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the hearts of others and so that you</v>

2057
01:54:10.061 --> 01:54:14.980
<v Speaker 9>get traumatized by betrayal and then you</v>
<v Speaker 9>become cynical and you think,</v>

2058
01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:19.981
<v Speaker 9>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a lot smarter now that I'm cynical </v>

2059
01:54:19.981 --> 01:54:21.160
<v Speaker 9>and you are because cynical is actually </v>
<v Speaker 9>a move up on naive,</v>

2060
01:54:21.670 --> 01:54:26.670
<v Speaker 9>but it's not the last move.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The last move is to transcend cynicism </v>

2061
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:31.910
<v Speaker 9>and to say that even though I know that </v>
<v Speaker 9>there are just as many snakes in your </v>

2062
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:35.821
<v Speaker 9>heart as there are in my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to hold out my hand in trust </v>

2063
01:54:35.821 --> 01:54:37.270
<v Speaker 9>because that's the best way to elevate </v>
<v Speaker 9>both of us.</v>

2064
01:54:37.650 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 8>That is the prerequisite for a sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 8>discussion to concede that</v>

2065
01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:51.440
<v Speaker 1>going on about our stuff along this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concede that it's not between good and </v>

2066
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.890
<v Speaker 1>evil but between competing virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to something like the </v>

2067
01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:57.390
<v Speaker 1>board has discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with justice and mercy.</v>

2068
01:54:57.690 --> 01:55:00.290
<v Speaker 1>You can not only be driven by one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those virtues,</v>

2069
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 1>mercy itself will lead you to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justice on its own wind unseeing can </v>

2070
01:55:07.171 --> 01:55:08.030
<v Speaker 1>lead you to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2071
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:08.120
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2072
01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.220
<v Speaker 9>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

2073
01:55:09.221 --> 01:55:14.221
<v Speaker 9>and so this also,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and we're running very short on time </v>

2074
01:55:14.221 --> 01:55:16.420
<v Speaker 9>here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so we should have think this is also why</v>

2075
01:55:16.421 --> 01:55:21.421
<v Speaker 9>your emphasis on truth and the emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 9>on truth is so absolutely important </v>

2076
01:55:21.421 --> 01:55:25.220
<v Speaker 9>because you and I obviously differ in on</v>
<v Speaker 9>a variety of different things and,</v>

2077
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.490
<v Speaker 9>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>as Douglas does with both of us.</v>

2078
01:55:27.491 --> 01:55:30.280
<v Speaker 9>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that doesn't mean.</v>

2079
01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:33.040
<v Speaker 9>That doesn't mean that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're a bad person.</v>

2080
01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:38.400
<v Speaker 9>I don't think that actually what I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what I think and what I fervently hope </v>

2081
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.331
<v Speaker 9>is that some of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 9>think are wrong actually turn out to be </v>

2082
01:55:42.331 --> 01:55:45.380
<v Speaker 9>right in a way that would extremely </v>
<v Speaker 9>helpful to me at everyone.</v>

2083
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:50.390
<v Speaker 9>I know if I incorporated them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I really hope that because I'd </v>

2084
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:53.871
<v Speaker 9>rather not be stupid and wrong if I </v>
<v Speaker 9>could help it because then I don't have </v>

2085
01:55:53.871 --> 01:55:53.871
<v Speaker 9>to wander into a pit.</v>

2086
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 9>And so I'm hoping that if,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if we can have a genuine dialogue and we</v>

2087
01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:00.840
<v Speaker 9>can tell each other the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the crucial issue here,</v>

2088
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:06.020
<v Speaker 9>then I can find out what you know that I</v>
<v Speaker 9>don't know and that'll make me stronger </v>

2089
01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:09.531
<v Speaker 9>and it will fortify everyone around me </v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's the basis for the right and </v>

2090
01:56:09.531 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 9>responsibility of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2091
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:16.401
<v Speaker 9>You have the right of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that's so that you can be a </v>

2092
01:56:16.401 --> 01:56:19.251
<v Speaker 9>responsible bearer of free speech so </v>
<v Speaker 9>that you can say the truth so that you </v>

2093
01:56:20.551 --> 01:56:24.000
<v Speaker 9>can set the world right in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>adjust the hierarchies and make sure the</v>

2094
01:56:24.001 --> 01:56:29.001
<v Speaker 9>borders are properly functional and so </v>
<v Speaker 9>that we can keep this thing going </v>

2095
01:56:29.001 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 9>properly and that is all dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 9>at least in part,</v>

2096
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:36.140
<v Speaker 9>in large part on the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But also to some degree on this faculty </v>

2097
01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 9>that you described is rational because </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're engaged in Iraq.</v>

2098
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 9>I know rationality isn't denounced that </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's my sense,</v>

2099
01:56:40.651 --> 01:56:45.651
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's certainly an adult form of </v>

2100
01:56:45.651 --> 01:56:47.400
<v Speaker 9>communication and definitely the </v>
<v Speaker 9>prerequisite to a discussion like this,</v>

2101
01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:52.610
<v Speaker 9>which seems to be highly useful and </v>
<v Speaker 9>which I'm so happy that you're all </v>

2102
01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:57.100
<v Speaker 9>willing to participate in how strangely,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how strange that is not.</v>

2103
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:08.530
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well we've been showing various cards </v>

2104
01:57:08.530 --> 01:57:10.410
<v Speaker 6>that had diminishing increments of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and now they have just stopped showing </v>

2105
01:57:10.410 --> 01:57:14.861
<v Speaker 6>us car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because we're totally </v>

2106
01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:14.861
<v Speaker 6>encourageable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2107
01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:15.880
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want to reiterate what,</v>

2108
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:20.910
<v Speaker 6>what Jordan's just said there are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You all really are the occasion for this</v>

2109
01:57:21.261 --> 01:57:22.730
<v Speaker 6>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even though you are,</v>

2110
01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:27.880
<v Speaker 6>are in the audience and we're on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We very much feel that this conversation</v>

2111
01:57:28.491 --> 01:57:33.491
<v Speaker 6>is with all of you and we know the </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation continues in your lives and</v>

2112
01:57:33.570 --> 01:57:34.340
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

2113
01:57:34.341 --> 01:57:37.320
<v Speaker 6>it's just a tremendous honor to show up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2114
01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:39.680
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and meet all of you in this space.</v>

2115
01:57:39.681 --> 01:57:41.450
<v Speaker 6>And so thank you for that.</v>

2116
01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.610
<v Speaker 8>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to thank.</v>

2117
01:57:50.210 --> 01:57:51.500
<v Speaker 8>I want to thank both of these men.</v>

2118
01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:56.980
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've never gotten together before like </v>

2119
01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:56.980
<v Speaker 6>this and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a.</v>

2120
01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:00.610
<v Speaker 6>it's a great pleasure to be confronted </v>
<v Speaker 6>and cajoled and ate your company.</v>

2121
01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:02.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Thank you all very much.</v>
