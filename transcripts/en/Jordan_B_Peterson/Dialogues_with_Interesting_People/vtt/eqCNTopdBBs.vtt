1
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>So I'm here today with author Greg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg is president of fire foundation for</v>

2
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.751
<v Speaker 1>individual rights in education and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Heit is an eminent social </v>

3
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.371
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and professor of ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership at New York University's </v>

4
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Stern School of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have coauthored a new book called </v>

5
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.351
<v Speaker 1>the coddling of the American mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an elaborated version of a </v>

6
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>famous Atlantic monthly SSA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They published a while back and so today</v>

7
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.831
<v Speaker 1>we're here to talk about their new book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and about the state of the universities </v>

8
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:55.551
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose society at large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thanks guys very much for joining me </v>

9
00:00:55.551 --> 00:01:00.531
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought maybe we'd start talking </v>

10
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:04.701
<v Speaker 1>about the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you guys want to provide some </v>

11
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.831
<v Speaker 1>background?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could talk about the Atlantic </v>

12
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>monthly essay and what led up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and then we'll get into the </v>

13
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 2>It all started in 2007 when I was lucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to have a full on medical level </v>

15
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 2>of depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

16
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it in some sort of detail </v>

17
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.731
<v Speaker 2>in the book I realized it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>level at which I realized I wrote about </v>

19
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 2>it with details that my wife doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

20
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird privacy thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes happens when you're dictating </v>

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 2>into a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just between me and the computer</v>

22
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and now I realize it's probably the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>public thing,</v>

23
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that saved me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that ultimately helped me deal</v>

24
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 2>with my depression general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as cognitive behavioral therapy,</v>

25
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense it's sort of like applied </v>

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 2>stoicism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just look at your own thoughts.</v>

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 2>You talked back to the really </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated ones.</v>

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>You've labeled them as cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>distortions that these include things </v>

29
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 2>like generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophizing,</v>

30
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 2>binary thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

31
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 2>everything has to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all good or bad.</v>

32
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually particularly guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

33
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 2>And Amazingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just actually learned what these </v>

34
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.351
<v Speaker 2>distortions are and practice everyday to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of talk back to sort of the more </v>

35
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>anxious or depressed voices in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

36
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly effective treatment </v>
<v Speaker 2>for depression and anxiety.</v>

37
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>And it changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely changed my life.</v>

38
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as this is changing my life,</v>

39
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm still working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the president of fire,</v>

40
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 2>which means I defend free speech and due</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and academic freedom on campus.</v>

41
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was learning all of these </v>

42
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 2>intellectual habits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these ways to sort of talk </v>

43
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.951
<v Speaker 2>yourself down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking around at what </v>

44
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>administrators we're doing and an ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>and saying to myself,</v>

45
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kind of like the </v>

46
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 2>administrators are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do engage in cognitive distortions,</v>

48
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 2>do engage in binary thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do overgeneralize and most of all </v>

49
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 2>catastrophize all the time.</v>

50
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking something to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect of,</v>

51
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 2>well thank goodness the students don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to really be buying it.</v>

52
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's what changed in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014 prior to 2013,</v>

53
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>2014 since I started in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst constituency for free speech </v>

54
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>on campus was actually administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best,</v>

55
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:17.161
<v Speaker 2>most reliable fans of free speech you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could run into on campus were generally </v>

56
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>the students themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then sometime around 2013,</v>

57
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.840
<v Speaker 2>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw a.</v>

58
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they were demanding everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>from trigger warnings to microaggression</v>

59
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>policies to December stations for even </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

60
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both on the left and the right on </v>

61
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum and it seemed like we said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to happen almost overnight and</v>

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and when I went to talk to John about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

64
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>we'd become friends through a mutual </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend and I said,</v>

65
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 2>it's almost that I talked about my whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that we're teaching a generation </v>

66
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>the habits of anxious and depressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from cognitive behavioral </v>

67
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John got really excited about the idea,</v>

68
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and asked if I wanted to write about it.</v>

69
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And I was already a fan of John's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

70
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

71
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought that his insight into what </v>

72
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 3>had changed was absolutely brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

73
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I had just begun to notice this in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own teaching.</v>

74
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I've been teaching since 1995 at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Virginia originally and it</v>

75
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.880
<v Speaker 3>was seemingly overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right around 2014.</v>

76
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.290
<v Speaker 3>These new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

77
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:18.410
<v Speaker 3>students of course are political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They protest,</v>

78
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 3>they object to things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what was new Grad?</v>

79
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 3>Put his finger on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was new was the idea that these </v>

80
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 3>words are going to harm me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just defend me,</v>

81
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 3>not just be unjust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harm me.</v>

82
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:32.081
<v Speaker 3>We have to protect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this idea that students are </v>

83
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.571
<v Speaker 3>fragile and need protection and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection should come from </v>

84
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 3>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from adults.</v>

85
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what was new and disturbing.</v>

86
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you guys talk in the book about </v>

87
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>concept creep and the overgeneralization</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of trauma and you know,</v>

88
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really struck </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as interesting about the safe space </v>

89
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>movement and the microaggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies and all of that is that it does</v>

90
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.921
<v Speaker 1>run so contrary to what every clinician </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth his or her salt knows about </v>

91
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:03.361
<v Speaker 1>treating anxiety or depression and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>one so.</v>

92
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of a remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A phenomenon in itself is that what we </v>

93
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.381
<v Speaker 1>know clinically has been absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>inverted by people who are </v>

94
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically agitating on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>students' mental health.</v>

95
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.531
<v Speaker 1>And it's not as if the mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>community has stood up on moss and </v>

96
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>denounced this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

97
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And I also don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

98
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.911
<v Speaker 1>I also don't understand how we got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys talk in the book a little bit </v>

99
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:33.781
<v Speaker 1>about your little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hypothesize a little bit about the </v>

100
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>internet generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

101
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:40.081
<v Speaker 1>And those are the kids born after 1995.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't put the finger on the </v>

102
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:43.591
<v Speaker 1>millennials but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's talk a little bit about why </v>

103
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you think things changed in 2013 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>

104
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Let me just first say your point about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole,</v>

105
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>these whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these new ideas are not clinically </v>

106
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that we suggest in the book.</v>

107
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if this is going on.</v>

108
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.170
<v Speaker 3>To what extent is this a sincere desire </v>
<v Speaker 3>for protection and a sincere belief that</v>

109
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:10.361
<v Speaker 3>students are fragile and to what extent </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it the pursuing of a political agenda</v>

110
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:10.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

111
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>and making political points and using </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health as a cover.</v>

112
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I think both are operative and and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it may depend on the context.</v>

113
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think the first one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>operative?</v>

114
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Because this runs so contrary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's known about the actual</v>

115
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.371
<v Speaker 1>protection of mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very skeptical about attributing a </v>

116
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.110
<v Speaker 1>positive motivation to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

117
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven by resentment.</v>

118
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

119
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.090
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

120
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.760
<v Speaker 3>so you're absolutely right that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological community does not support</v>

121
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet has not stood up very vocally to</v>

122
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 3>condemn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are hopeful that psychologists and</v>

123
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone we spoke to,</v>

124
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 3>agreed that ends over only exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst thing to do for someone who </v>

125
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>suffers from ptsd is to sweep clean </v>
<v Speaker 3>their daily life of reminders,</v>

126
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.470
<v Speaker 3>thereby denying them the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>situate,</v>

127
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 3>to decondition the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

128
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 3>the power of these quotes triggers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real world.</v>

129
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It's worse in some sense too because one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things you do when you expose </v>

130
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:26.171
<v Speaker 1>people who have anxiety disorders to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are anxious about is not </v>

131
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>make them less anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make them more courageous.</v>

132
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it generalizes because </v>

133
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.401
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts thought that exposure</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just mean the fears would pop up </v>

134
00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

135
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's because people learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to them than they thought.</v>

136
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And then when you protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do not expose them,</v>

137
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>which is a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also teach them to generalize.</v>

138
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:52.271
<v Speaker 1>The idea of their weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really terrible thing to do </v>

139
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>to people so you couldn't invent more </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive mental health movement</v>

140
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 1>and instituted on campus is if you set </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to design it.</v>

141
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 2>That's something that we always try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasize.</v>

142
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>So interesting for us to look at was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

143
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 2>the third anti free speech movement is </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from students,</v>

145
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the relatively recent past,</v>

146
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Speaker 2>so late eighties and early nineties for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

147
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that was so striking was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were medicalizing all,</v>

148
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>all of these claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.490
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm sitting there going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't sound right.</v>

150
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to John and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't sound right.</v>

151
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 2>And we interviewed for the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>

152
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe seven different clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>

153
00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>cbt experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

155
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And the thing I keep on trying keep on </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining it as it's,</v>

156
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 2>as a fraternity up what could be a minor</v>
<v Speaker 2>version into something more like a </v>

157
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 2>phobia because we're giving it so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more power.</v>

158
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And the worst thing of all that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

159
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.220
<v Speaker 2>so much of our campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're turning it into a Schema.</v>

160
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 2>We're turning the idea that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm broken into,</v>

161
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

162
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a permanent sort of self definition.</v>

163
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I do think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a mixed motive thing going</v>

164
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 3>on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have a self fulfilling </v>

165
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.021
<v Speaker 3>prophecy going on to some degree because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that some of this kind of </v>

166
00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:06.531
<v Speaker 3>hopeless ideology is actually genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard students actually making them </v>

167
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:10.481
<v Speaker 3>more anxious and depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course it's really incompatible </v>

168
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:10.481
<v Speaker 3>with</v>

169
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.650
<v Speaker 1>statistics to that end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you guys </v>

170
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.621
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the book is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is statistics indicating that there has </v>

171
00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>in fact been there is evidence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline in mental health over the last.</v>

172
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 1>What is it about the last decade</v>

173
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.970
<v Speaker 3>since around 22,000?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine to 2012 is when the elbow,</v>

174
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.220
<v Speaker 3>that's where things begin to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to arch up.</v>

175
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 3>And then they go steadily up to about </v>
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>

176
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.710
<v Speaker 3>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know if they're still going up </v>

177
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.381
<v Speaker 3>or if they're plateauing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what's going into a little </v>

178
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.350
<v Speaker 3>bit of detail because it was just an </v>
<v Speaker 3>article in the New York Times.</v>

179
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Richard Friedman psychiatrist wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 3>article,</v>

180
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.660
<v Speaker 3>something about how the idea of a wave </v>
<v Speaker 3>of increased anxiety is a myth.</v>

181
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.110
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said it's just based on one or two,</v>

182
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been some,</v>

183
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 3>a couple of self report studies in which</v>
<v Speaker 3>students say that they're more anxious.</v>

184
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.020
<v Speaker 3>And he dismissed that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry America,</v>

185
00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:07.021
<v Speaker 3>you kids aren't becoming more anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we thought we dug into this in </v>

186
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 3>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did not want to catastrophize.</v>

187
00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:12.670
<v Speaker 3>We did not want to foment a moral panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we didn't want to say,</v>

188
00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:13.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

189
00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:14.620
<v Speaker 3>the sky is falling.</v>

190
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

191
00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:18.190
<v Speaker 3>are depressed and anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we looked into this in great detail.</v>

192
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were.</v>

193
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So we were looking for this data in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>art Atlantic article and it wasn't </v>

194
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

195
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 3>that is the anecdotes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were saying the mental health </v>

196
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.381
<v Speaker 3>centers are swamped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were plenty of reports from </v>

197
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:36.391
<v Speaker 3>mental health centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't this just because kids these </v>

198
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:37.090
<v Speaker 3>days are more comfortable seeking </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>

199
00:10:37.091 --> 00:10:38.630
<v Speaker 3>That's why the mental health centers is </v>
<v Speaker 3>swap.</v>

200
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's no real increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Atlantic article we could not make</v>

201
00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 3>a strong case and we left it very </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculative,</v>

202
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.900
<v Speaker 3>but just two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

203
00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:50.860
<v Speaker 3>when Jean [inaudible] book came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I aged and she brought in data from,</v>

204
00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:55.861
<v Speaker 3>for national nationally representative </v>
<v Speaker 3>surveys showing that it really is an </v>

205
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 3>increased out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

206
00:10:57.041 --> 00:11:00.400
<v Speaker 3>those were almost all self report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What convinced us,</v>

207
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.580
<v Speaker 3>but convince us that it's real is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

208
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 3>there was a major study done published </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Jama,</v>

209
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Journal of American Medical Association </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at hospital admission data.</v>

210
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.550
<v Speaker 3>So they broke it down by gender and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>always have to look male,</v>

211
00:11:12.551 --> 00:11:13.220
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>separate.</v>

212
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They broke it down by sex and by age </v>
<v Speaker 3>group within teenagers and for all of </v>

213
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Speaker 3>the age groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for four of the girls,</v>

214
00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:25.150
<v Speaker 3>teenage girls hospital admissions for </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell part from cutting yourself,</v>

215
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 3>taking voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nonfatal.</v>

216
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flat,</v>

217
00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:29.410
<v Speaker 3>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

218
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.060
<v Speaker 3>And then right around 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012,</v>

219
00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:33.070
<v Speaker 3>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he starts going up and up and up,</v>

220
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 3>and of course the rate is lowest for 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>to 13 year old girl.</v>

221
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:41.231
<v Speaker 3>So let's let the do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the increase was the largest and 20 </v>

222
00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:45.541
<v Speaker 3>says that social media is social </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison seems to be hardest on the </v>

223
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:50.161
<v Speaker 3>youngest girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the self harm data confirms this is </v>

224
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:50.860
<v Speaker 3>behavioral data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not self report.</v>

225
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the real kicker,</v>

226
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 3>it's suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the suicide statistics,</v>

227
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 3>they showed the same pattern as the self</v>
<v Speaker 3>report of depression data,</v>

228
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

229
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the first decade of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

230
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 3>so 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one to two to 2010,</v>

231
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 3>the average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number of kids who killed themselves </v>

232
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 3>successfully commits suicide.</v>

233
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 3>The rate for boys from that decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

234
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.740
<v Speaker 3>through Twenty 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2016,</v>

235
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 3>those two years of data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes up and up and up up 25 percent,</v>

236
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.960
<v Speaker 3>which is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been an enormous increase in </v>

237
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 3>voice suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The increase for girls is 70 percent,</v>

238
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 3>seven zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So boys,</v>

239
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 3>the rate is higher for boys because </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls make many more attempts,</v>

240
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 3>but boys methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the.</v>

241
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 3>So the increase is actually fairly </v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel,</v>

242
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but as a percentage is much higher for </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

243
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Social Media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least this is his argument and we </v>

244
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.060
<v Speaker 3>think there's some validity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenties argument is that the spread of </v>

245
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 3>of iphones and social media has brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>boys into play video games.</v>

246
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 3>They play a lot of video games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those aren't actually that harmful.</v>

247
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the social comparison sites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a instagram and and other things </v>

248
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:06.781
<v Speaker 3>where girls are comparing their lives to</v>
<v Speaker 3>other girls and feeling left out that we</v>

249
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:12.241
<v Speaker 3>think we don't know for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that we think is the most powerful </v>

250
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:12.590
<v Speaker 3>reason why the girls rates have </v>
<v Speaker 3>increased so much.</v>

251
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Greenberg.</v>

252
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 3>That data too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because even since 2007,</v>

253
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.830
<v Speaker 3>if you just pick 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a doubling in terms </v>

254
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 3>of suicide in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the.</v>

255
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 3>That was the lowest year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you just.</v>

256
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's best to not take 2007.</v>

257
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It's best to just take the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>bounces around.</v>

258
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 3>No trend in the first decade.</v>

259
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could hypothesize perhaps that </v>

260
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.110
<v Speaker 1>there's something approximating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive feedback loop going on here.</v>

261
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So imagine because I'm trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out why things have gone out of control,</v>

262
00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>say since 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's been a tipping point.</v>

263
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to offer a few ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys can tell me what you think.</v>

264
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

265
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>let's think of four or five reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's an increase in </v>

266
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.501
<v Speaker 1>political perceived political </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization and maybe real political </v>

267
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:03.320
<v Speaker 1>polarization because the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

268
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media is dying and as it dies</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>

269
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.810
<v Speaker 1>it gets more attracted to quick bait </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism and exaggerates the degree of</v>

270
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:16.811
<v Speaker 1>extremism on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a consequence of a </v>

271
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:20.201
<v Speaker 1>technological revolution that the threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're under from probably from </v>

272
00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Internet media sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>

273
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>The next one would be the UN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm opposed,</v>

274
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:33.491
<v Speaker 1>rise of the postmodern Marxist doctrines</v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize disciplines,</v>

275
00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:35.450
<v Speaker 1>particularly like women's studies.</v>

276
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you guys talked about a woman who </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated,</v>

277
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality theory,</v>

278
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Kimberle crenshaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd been looking into Kate Millett </v>

279
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 1>who established patriarchy theory or one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people who established it and she</v>

280
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.260
<v Speaker 1>was a radical lesbian for political </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and had an alcoholic and abusive</v>

281
00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:01.571
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's quite interesting and </v>

282
00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that these theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crenshaw and,</v>

283
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and millets theories were basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored by serious scholars in the,</v>

284
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.460
<v Speaker 1>in the academic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've spread and have had a </v>

285
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:17.801
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities and their combined with a </v>

286
00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 1>kind of Marxist viewpoints that divides </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world into victimizer and victim.</v>

287
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe we have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you just said.</v>

288
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Bet.</v>

289
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.180
<v Speaker 3>On the political polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

290
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:36.181
<v Speaker 3>We have a whole chapter on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to think about this as </v>

291
00:15:36.181 --> 00:15:39.371
<v Speaker 3>universities are complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions nested within a broader </v>

292
00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.430
<v Speaker 3>society and they're changing and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>broader society has changed.</v>

293
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.440
<v Speaker 3>And so we document how the rise in </v>
<v Speaker 3>political polarization and here the </v>

294
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.280
<v Speaker 3>thing to focus on is not polarization of</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitudes about abortion or things like </v>

295
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.211
<v Speaker 3>that is how much do you hate the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side that has been going up steadily </v>

296
00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:57.460
<v Speaker 3>since the 19 nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have a left right battle,</v>

297
00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:02.461
<v Speaker 3>it's getting more and more intense at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time as the professoriate is </v>

298
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.480
<v Speaker 3>going from leaning left to being much </v>
<v Speaker 3>further on the left.</v>

299
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:07.110
<v Speaker 3>So we document this in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

300
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.720
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overall left right ratio for a </v>

301
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:12.720
<v Speaker 3>variety of reasons went from a two to </v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

302
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.940
<v Speaker 3>one overall putting everybody to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to one of the early nineties,</v>

303
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.500
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to one left,</v>

304
00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:22.501
<v Speaker 3>right ratio by 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a more politically </v>

305
00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:26.071
<v Speaker 3>purified institution at a time when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electromagnetic forces of crossbars and </v>

306
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.180
<v Speaker 3>hatred are ginning up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yes,</v>

307
00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:31.390
<v Speaker 3>you have a more politicized institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot going on there.</v>

308
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not unique to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just so happens that universities </v>

309
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Speaker 3>have been polarizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left other institutions,</v>

310
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:37.350
<v Speaker 3>polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

311
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.780
<v Speaker 3>If you believe in diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe that diversity makes </v>

312
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.591
<v Speaker 3>people think better because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges thoughts in a loss of </v>

313
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:46.090
<v Speaker 3>political diversity is harmful and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a contributor,</v>

314
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.930
<v Speaker 2>echo chambers that we agreed on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

315
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Social media does go to pat you on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back for having those thick of an echo </v>

316
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 2>chamber as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

317
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely a big proponent of sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the big sort of hypothesis certainly </v>

318
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 2>lived this experience that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly live in a politically </v>

319
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.060
<v Speaker 2>homogeneous communities now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Sort of course talks about us living</v>

320
00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:08.250
<v Speaker 2>in more politically homogeneous </v>
<v Speaker 2>counties,</v>

321
00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but Charles Murray and others have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>research about how we actually live even</v>

322
00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:17.001
<v Speaker 2>more politically homogeneous city blocks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually we are sort of self </v>

323
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:17.820
<v Speaker 2>sorting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyler Cowen talks about this too,</v>

324
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 2>and of course if you have sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>social circle where you practically </v>

325
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.220
<v Speaker 2>never run into anybody who disagrees </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

326
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different sort of tribalism </v>

327
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.891
<v Speaker 2>experiments that they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>polarization experiments they've done </v>

328
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:32.640
<v Speaker 2>over the years shows that you attend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of spiral off into the distance.</v>

329
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:34.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the reasons why I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

330
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.660
<v Speaker 2>this is what we call him the book of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with progress,</v>

331
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 2>but if you think about the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can live in communities that reflect our</v>

332
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:43.740
<v Speaker 2>values going back around late 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

333
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.460
<v Speaker 2>that sounds lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds great,</v>

334
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in communities for my values,</v>

335
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but if you've ever lived in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reflects just one political point </v>

336
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.911
<v Speaker 2>of view and virtually none of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does have a tendency to become a </v>

337
00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:59.870
<v Speaker 2>virtue signal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a contest more than an actual place </v>

338
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.870
<v Speaker 2>where you discuss ideas.</v>

339
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now let's move on to the services of </v>

340
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

341
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.620
<v Speaker 3>so I think you and I both agree that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that postmodernism Marxism,</v>

342
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these are lenses that tend to </v>

343
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.060
<v Speaker 3>amplify conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are somehow involved.</v>

344
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you and I may disagree a bit on </v>

345
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 3>the dynamics here and the extent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll just leave it.</v>

346
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.660
<v Speaker 3>The way that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas,</v>

347
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:24.560
<v Speaker 3>this way of looking at things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even these ideas of of trigger warnings,</v>

348
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:29.561
<v Speaker 3>matrices of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those ideas existed in feminist circles </v>

349
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:32.891
<v Speaker 3>going all the way back to the nineties </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a professor at Nyu and previous that </v>

350
00:18:32.891 --> 00:18:37.751
<v Speaker 3>Uva,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not seen that postmodernism or </v>

351
00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Marxism or in any way spreading across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disciplines.</v>

352
00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:42.110
<v Speaker 3>They've always been there in a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplines.</v>

353
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of of Marxist analysis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sociology.</v>

354
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.770
<v Speaker 3>I have not noticed that spreading at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>among the professoriate or across </v>

355
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:50.770
<v Speaker 3>disciplines.</v>

356
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I think what has happened is that social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media and the Internet,</v>

357
00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:58.511
<v Speaker 3>especially social media has knocked down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the compartments a good society needs a </v>

358
00:18:58.521 --> 00:19:00.800
<v Speaker 3>lot of compartments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs a lot of walls,</v>

359
00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:05.801
<v Speaker 3>were different norms and different </v>
<v Speaker 3>practices flourish that you can do </v>

360
00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 3>different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think social media is knocked down the</v>

361
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:12.701
<v Speaker 3>walls so that certain ideas that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>some students get from their gender </v>

362
00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.150
<v Speaker 3>studies or anthropology or sociology </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes,</v>

363
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.140
<v Speaker 3>those ideas can spread among the </v>
<v Speaker 3>students and they're often not even </v>

364
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.110
<v Speaker 3>really the accurate ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a sort of a bastardized version,</v>

365
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.460
<v Speaker 3>a modified in ways that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>even understand that can spread around.</v>

366
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:31.730
<v Speaker 3>This is how you can get bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological ideas that political ideas</v>

367
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:37.390
<v Speaker 3>spreading around among the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's been most striking to us </v>

368
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.430
<v Speaker 3>is that this is really the change is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really student led.</v>

369
00:19:37.431 --> 00:19:42.431
<v Speaker 3>It's a generational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can blame faculty and in certain </v>

370
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:46.631
<v Speaker 3>departments for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can certainly disagree with their </v>

371
00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:48.631
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that there's this </v>

372
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:48.631
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy as far as we can tell a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy,</v>

373
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the professors to take over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll disagree with that.</v>

374
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.820
<v Speaker 3>We see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it as more student led.</v>

375
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to talk a lot about John </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talk a lot about,</v>

376
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't quite make it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

377
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 2>What we've dubbed it is the fortress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we mean by that is if you look </v>

378
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 2>at the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

379
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I went to Stanford for law school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked for the Eclu of Northern </v>

380
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

381
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Speaker 2>and I saw this sort of happening even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties that one of the </v>

382
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:15.710
<v Speaker 2>things that some of these postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

383
00:20:15.711 --> 00:20:20.711
<v Speaker 2>particularly privileged theory allow is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a matter of arguing in which you never </v>

384
00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:23.540
<v Speaker 2>ever have to get to the substance of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

385
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.750
<v Speaker 2>So even in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reformable borders had a lot of levels </v>

386
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.351
<v Speaker 2>of protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to listen to anybody if </v>

387
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:32.351
<v Speaker 2>they're conservative was almost taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>for granted,</v>

388
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:34.460
<v Speaker 2>which I deeply ashamed of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

389
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.330
<v Speaker 2>and now if you add to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to listen to anybody.</v>

391
00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:43.331
<v Speaker 2>If they have privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way 100 percent of people </v>

392
00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:46.151
<v Speaker 2>actually do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you can choose to listen to </v>

393
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:48.060
<v Speaker 2>whomever the hell you want because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only optional.</v>

394
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>You have an option to either dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>marks a as being a white privileged male</v>

395
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:57.781
<v Speaker 2>or you can listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anytime you run into someone who </v>

396
00:20:57.781 --> 00:21:00.541
<v Speaker 2>disagrees with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have several sort of tools at your </v>

397
00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:00.541
<v Speaker 2>disposal.</v>

398
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 2>The was that were white males defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>our privileged.</v>

399
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Almost nobody engaged with the substance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the argument.</v>

400
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boiled down to the power claims of </v>

401
00:21:18.871 --> 00:21:22.650
<v Speaker 1>competing identity groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is no such thing as substance</v>

402
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:28.010
<v Speaker 1>and I think that actually fits quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely with certain strains of </v>

403
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.071
<v Speaker 1>postmodern thinking that have a tendency</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny any knowledge of any real world </v>

404
00:21:31.071 --> 00:21:35.550
<v Speaker 1>and to presume that everything is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only interpretation interpretation based</v>

405
00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:40.551
<v Speaker 1>on a power claims for competing groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the intersectionality theory.</v>

406
00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:45.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just finished writing the preface to </v>

407
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Speaker 1>that new version of the Fiftieth </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anniversary version of the Gulag.</v>

408
00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:52.641
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago was quite something and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to synthesize Solzhenitsyn's </v>

409
00:21:55.861 --> 00:22:00.861
<v Speaker 1>arguments about why the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution went so badly south </v>

410
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:04.950
<v Speaker 1>immediately after it began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very interesting to think about</v>

411
00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:09.951
<v Speaker 1>it from this intersectionality </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because as you guys just </v>

412
00:22:09.951 --> 00:22:13.971
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an unreasonable proposition </v>

413
00:22:13.971 --> 00:22:16.110
<v Speaker 1>that people have multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple group identities.</v>

414
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there's some use in considering </v>

415
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.461
<v Speaker 1>that because you can think of the ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have different advantages </v>

416
00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:29.181
<v Speaker 1>and disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the real pernicious side </v>

417
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:33.411
<v Speaker 1>effects of that kind of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's conjoined with a </v>

418
00:22:33.411 --> 00:22:36.090
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint that divides the world into </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim and victimizer,</v>

419
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:41.091
<v Speaker 1>is that you can take any one person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe generate 20 group identities for </v>

420
00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:46.671
<v Speaker 1>them and you can find at least one </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity along which they're privileged </v>

421
00:22:46.671 --> 00:22:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and that means that not only can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore them as a consequence of them </v>

422
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.751
<v Speaker 1>speaking only on behalf of their power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a valid reason for </v>

423
00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:58.011
<v Speaker 1>persecuting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what happened in the </v>

424
00:22:58.011 --> 00:22:58.011
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>

425
00:22:58.011 --> 00:22:59.850
<v Speaker 1>As long as I could find one dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>along which you were an oppressor,</v>

426
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.440
<v Speaker 1>then you were done.</v>

427
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

429
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were the best example of that.</v>

430
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Any other countries where search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where my family comes from and in</v>

431
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:16.580
<v Speaker 2>any other country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:23:16.581 --> 00:23:21.581
<v Speaker 2>my family's story would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we went from being to being </v>

433
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:21.770
<v Speaker 2>lawyers and judges within a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

434
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather was in Kiev,</v>
<v Speaker 2>polytechnic studying to be a professor </v>

435
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.470
<v Speaker 2>when World War One broke out and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course people like me,</v>

436
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.160
<v Speaker 2>success stories and any other country we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were shot in the back of the head by the</v>

437
00:23:34.161 --> 00:23:34.550
<v Speaker 2>millions.</v>

438
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

439
00:23:35.731 --> 00:23:40.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were actually the working class </v>

440
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:40.731
<v Speaker 1>success stories because when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was,</v>

441
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 1>when was eradicated in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

442
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.280
<v Speaker 1>in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

443
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people</v>

444
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.490
<v Speaker 1>were basically slaves up to that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people made very rapid,</v>

445
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaps in status within a single </v>

446
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.161
<v Speaker 1>generation or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those were the Kulaks that were </v>

447
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.100
<v Speaker 1>medicated by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Soviets after World War One.</v>

448
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Then that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

449
00:24:00.451 --> 00:24:04.860
<v Speaker 1>that's what led to the huge starvation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and massive starvation of the 19,</v>

450
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.810
<v Speaker 1>late 1920 [inaudible] and 1930 </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and early 19 thirties.</v>

451
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So it was a complete catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

452
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

453
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you put together a bunch of symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you said well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>microaggression theory,</v>

455
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm no admirer of Daryl is derald wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sue?</v>

456
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

457
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read his book,</v>

458
00:24:23.221 --> 00:24:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in all in all possible manners.</v>

459
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.340
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of oppression theory and </v>

460
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.991
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we're in a patriarchal </v>

461
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:38.931
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one of the things that you've </v>

462
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:42.041
<v Speaker 1>pointed out at the beginning of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview was the unknown effect of </v>

463
00:24:42.391 --> 00:24:46.120
<v Speaker 1>social comparison with these new social </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>

464
00:24:46.121 --> 00:24:47.850
<v Speaker 1>social media technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

465
00:24:47.851 --> 00:24:52.851
<v Speaker 1>Because we're really at a really laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to these new technologies </v>

466
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.230
<v Speaker 1>because we have no idea what the effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have on adults,</v>

467
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Speaker 1>let alone young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so do you think that is actually </v>

468
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.911
<v Speaker 1>making young people feel that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a more dangerous place and requiring </v>

469
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:06.300
<v Speaker 1>them to seek protection?</v>

470
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think that's a big part of it.</v>

471
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Physical Safety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe or unsafe for death rates go down </v>

472
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 3>so you know Steve Pinker and many </v>
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>

473
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:24.251
<v Speaker 3>a chronicle of the decline of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we react to the world not as it is.</v>

474
00:25:25.111 --> 00:25:28.050
<v Speaker 3>We react to the world as we perceive it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the filters that were given.</v>

475
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remember the old movie from the </v>

476
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 3>19 eighties or nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the bowling for columbine boy,</v>

477
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Michael Moore's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowling for Columbine,</v>

478
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:42.650
<v Speaker 3>where he traces out why Americans are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid compared to Canadian,</v>

479
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

480
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 3>he blames it all on cable TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting stories of crime in our face.</v>

481
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.610
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a lot of truth to </v>

482
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:53.610
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

483
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.720
<v Speaker 3>imagine social media channeling not just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories of crime,</v>

484
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.450
<v Speaker 3>but whichever side you're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically,</v>

485
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.600
<v Speaker 3>you now get filtered through of all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stupid things that any person says </v>

486
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 3>in our country of 330 million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

487
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Someone on the left says something </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly stupid and offensive.</v>

488
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.250
<v Speaker 3>And everyday some of the rights says </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you know,</v>

489
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 3>and as a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're being.</v>

490
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.490
<v Speaker 3>So if you're rewarded for forwarding </v>
<v Speaker 3>outrage,</v>

491
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>things that outrage you aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're rewarded for forwarding them at </v>

492
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all forwarding it.</v>

493
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.850
<v Speaker 3>We're all drowning in outrage stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that that sells or</v>

494
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:32.851
<v Speaker 3>that sells in terms of getting retweets </v>
<v Speaker 3>is stories of aggression or violence or </v>

495
00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 3>racism or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People trampling on your side,</v>

496
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:38.440
<v Speaker 3>sacred values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're exposed constantly,</v>

497
00:26:38.441 --> 00:26:40.000
<v Speaker 3>the stories of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

498
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're exposed to stories of right not,</v>

499
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.220
<v Speaker 3>not season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that half the country is,</v>

500
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 3>this is going to have a big effect on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your perceptions,</v>

501
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 3>even if even if the reality is social </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>

502
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 3>even if the reality is increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>safety.</v>

503
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So we do think that the reason why it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so many things are going haywire,</v>

504
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.520
<v Speaker 3>not just in America but in many </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries is the Internet and social </v>

505
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 3>media all hitting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

506
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 3>globalization is the other factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more distant,</v>

507
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>but I think their intersection </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersecting interacting in all kinds of</v>

508
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 3>interesting ways that we don't yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

509
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.170
<v Speaker 1>We talked about polarization on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right than on the left.</v>

510
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that struck me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong about this,</v>

511
00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:26.191
<v Speaker 1>is that I'd be particularly concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the rise of the radical left.</v>

512
00:27:26.621 --> 00:27:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>immersed in the University of you and as</v>

513
00:27:31.391 --> 00:27:36.391
<v Speaker 1>you already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left is overrepresented at least </v>

514
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:40.321
<v Speaker 1>among the social scientists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities and I suspect as well the </v>

515
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:44.251
<v Speaker 1>administration in the universities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I see as well people being </v>

516
00:27:44.251 --> 00:27:45.670
<v Speaker 1>concerned about the rise of the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

517
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 1>But I certainly don't see the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>right as posing a threat in the </v>

518
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.701
<v Speaker 1>universities and I can't see what sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of threat the radical right is posing </v>

519
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.250
<v Speaker 1>because I can't get numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when,</v>

520
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of stories about outright</v>
<v Speaker 1>types and about neo Nazis and white </v>

521
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.070
<v Speaker 1>supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem,</v>

522
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 1>rally in Washington about a month and a </v>

523
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.570
<v Speaker 1>half ago and I think they got 16 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a bus on the white supremacists side </v>

524
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.221
<v Speaker 1>and several thousand counter protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm wondering to what degree the </v>

525
00:28:18.341 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 1>radical right is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.510
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know where they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

527
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So do you have thoughts about that?</v>

528
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

529
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.060
<v Speaker 3>In my work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this being the most recent </v>

530
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.761
<v Speaker 3>trend and we talk about this in the book</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not necessarily the radical </v>

531
00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've seen some of the talk about it</v>

532
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.670
<v Speaker 3>kind of like we have this sort of echo </v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber on the universities and there is</v>

533
00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:45.671
<v Speaker 3>a sort of an echo chamber on the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well and those two have been a sort </v>

534
00:28:45.671 --> 00:28:46.220
<v Speaker 3>of colliding with each other with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

535
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:51.460
<v Speaker 3>So we've definitely seen an uptick in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire of liberal professors getting in </v>

536
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.720
<v Speaker 3>trouble for what they say on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

537
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.290
<v Speaker 3>what they say on twitter or facebook or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

538
00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.600
<v Speaker 3>going on Fox News for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we talk about a couple of examples </v>

539
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.351
<v Speaker 3>of that in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is so recent that we're not </v>

540
00:29:05.351 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 3>going to have real data on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it definitely is a noticeable change</v>

541
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 3>for those of us who work on the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

542
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's important to look at the timing </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because we hear this a lot too.</v>

543
00:29:11.931 --> 00:29:13.190
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever we talk about something,</v>

544
00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:14.270
<v Speaker 3>people will find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

545
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:15.230
<v Speaker 3>what about the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

546
00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:17.120
<v Speaker 3>and what about the Nazis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

547
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.340
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we started this,</v>

548
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:21.930
<v Speaker 3>when Greg first notice what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2013,</v>

549
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.280
<v Speaker 3>2014 and in our article came out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>

550
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.590
<v Speaker 3>the right had nothing to do with it now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nobody had heard of the alt right </v>

551
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.740
<v Speaker 3>practically they weren't trolling on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus.</v>

552
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.200
<v Speaker 3>So whenever the origins of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>on campus,</v>

553
00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 3>it is not a reaction to the right now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2016,</v>

554
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right got a lot more attention and </v>

555
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.670
<v Speaker 3>it got much more sophisticated trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

556
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 3>as I read a little bit about trolling or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times began to cover it,</v>

557
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.790
<v Speaker 3>it became really clear all you need is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few people with a kind of a perverse </v>

558
00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 3>sense of humor and a few anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet accounts and they can provoke a</v>

559
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 3>gigantic reaction from the group that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to provoke.</v>

560
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And so I think in 2016 we saw the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and into 2017,</v>

561
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>that's where we start actually seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cases of right wing movements to get</v>

562
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:11.521
<v Speaker 3>professors fired there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some really nasty stuff coming </v>

563
00:30:11.521 --> 00:30:16.261
<v Speaker 3>out of various sites on the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>flooding people's inboxes with rape </v>

564
00:30:16.261 --> 00:30:17.850
<v Speaker 3>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And death threats and racist rants.</v>

565
00:30:17.851 --> 00:30:22.851
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of nasty stuff coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the right towards professors in </v>

566
00:30:22.851 --> 00:30:26.641
<v Speaker 3>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And since then it wasn't happening as </v>

567
00:30:26.641 --> 00:30:26.641
<v Speaker 3>far as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't anything new,</v>

568
00:30:26.641 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't really part of the story early</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

569
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 3>So we've talked to six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The polarization cycle of the problem we</v>

570
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 3>believe is not originally from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the right,</v>

571
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 3>although now they are a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>polarization cycle</v>

572
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>right out of the darkness in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

573
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've seen on youtube </v>

574
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 1>and the other commentary sources that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've be monitoring is a real increase in</v>

575
00:30:53.371 --> 00:30:57.120
<v Speaker 1>antisemitic comments and it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

576
00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to quantify that,</v>

577
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:02.550
<v Speaker 1>but your appallingly common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.670
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube and on twitter as well.</v>

579
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are coded,</v>

580
00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:13.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's common place nowadays to </v>

581
00:31:13.311 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 1>put your comment in three brackets which</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates a,</v>

582
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.870
<v Speaker 1>an antisemitic origin or emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very pernicious.</v>

583
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.360
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how many people are </v>

584
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>actually engaging in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very difficult thing to,</v>

585
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.240
<v Speaker 1>to come to terms with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like when I look at the United </v>

586
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.240
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

587
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.640
<v Speaker 1>and more power to you that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>political dialogue is actually quite </v>

588
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.211
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fair bit of power on the left </v>

589
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:41.211
<v Speaker 1>and there's a fair bit of power on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

590
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left seems to be </v>

591
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:45.780
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented in universities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's unique.</v>

592
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't get a handle on the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacists and Nazi types.</v>

593
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Nazis are vanishingly rare.</v>

594
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacists types as well,</v>

595
00:31:56.401 --> 00:32:01.401
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

596
00:32:01.401 --> 00:32:01.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't being cultivated in some sense.</v>

597
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is how much should we </v>
<v Speaker 3>react to it?</v>

598
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 3>So I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother told me when I was growing up </v>

599
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.470
<v Speaker 3>that America is the promised land for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jews.</v>

600
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel is the promised land.</v>

601
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was raised to believe that America is </v>

602
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.810
<v Speaker 3>the promised land for the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

603
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.380
<v Speaker 3>There was some antisemitism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents,</v>

604
00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.060
<v Speaker 3>we moved to Scarsdale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

605
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.400
<v Speaker 3>and they could not join certain country </v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs.</v>

606
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Big Deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were Jewish clubs,</v>

607
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:30.530
<v Speaker 3>there were clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way things were.</v>

608
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.000
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't perfect,</v>

609
00:32:32.001 --> 00:32:34.160
<v Speaker 3>but compared to what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compared to the rest of the world,</v>

610
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandparents got off the boat in New </v>

611
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 3>York and didn't go onto Buenos Aires or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

612
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 3>any place else that was settled </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally by the Spanish.</v>

613
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so America is not an antisemitic </v>

614
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

615
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 3>What do we make of the fact that now </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing all this antisemitic stuff.</v>

616
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:55.210
<v Speaker 3>What I make of it is that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few assholes who are organizing and </v>

617
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.571
<v Speaker 3>doing this and am I triggered by it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I grew up where occasionally you</v>

618
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 3>come across a swastika,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like scratched into the bathroom stall.</v>

619
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 3>You'd find the f word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd find them Saturdays,</v>

620
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 3>you'd find a drawing of a penis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd see a swastika.</v>

621
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.890
<v Speaker 3>And my reaction was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Yuck or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would go on with my day.</v>

623
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.110
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we teach kids now,</v>

624
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.200
<v Speaker 3>if you find something on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been triggered and of course you will </v>

625
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.200
<v Speaker 3>always find something on the Internet.</v>

626
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I will say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just anecdotal,</v>

627
00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I speak a lot of times in California and</v>

628
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.720
<v Speaker 2>some of the sort of anti Israel bleeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>into antisemitism is something that </v>

629
00:33:33.731 --> 00:33:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

630
00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen really dramatic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost as if it's become stylish to</v>

631
00:33:38.861 --> 00:33:41.560
<v Speaker 2>be so anti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're almost antisemitic.</v>

632
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:46.561
<v Speaker 2>At least certain circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I spoke at the British Labor Party </v>

633
00:33:46.561 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

634
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I spoke at the 50th anniversary of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>start of the free speech movement way </v>

635
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>back in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

636
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I spoke at Berkeley and I'll be damned </v>
<v Speaker 2>if my speech was not in a room with a </v>

637
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:02.611
<v Speaker 2>lot of antisemites and there was even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was trying to address this </v>

638
00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:02.611
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

639
00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:04.150
<v Speaker 2>and people want to call it antisemitic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so wrong,</v>

640
00:34:04.151 --> 00:34:07.980
<v Speaker 2>and then you finish that sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's undeniable that the poison hand</v>

641
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.240
<v Speaker 2>of Zionism destroys everything it </v>
<v Speaker 2>touches.</v>

642
00:34:10.241 --> 00:34:11.890
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

643
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's A.</v>

644
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand wanting to call you </v>

645
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

646
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's in people's heads </v>

647
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.440
<v Speaker 2>that this is real and I've noticed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>most pronounced for some reason in </v>

648
00:34:24.461 --> 00:34:24.940
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

649
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the idea of.</v>

650
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened in </v>

651
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Germany in the 19 twenties was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization process,</v>

652
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously much more severe than the </v>

653
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.801
<v Speaker 1>one that we're going through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if when the political </v>

654
00:34:43.801 --> 00:34:48.451
<v Speaker 1>spectrum polarizes that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism of a certain sort of rises</v>

655
00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:53.761
<v Speaker 1>and drive something like antisemitism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe maybe when the left and the </v>

656
00:34:54.341 --> 00:34:59.341
<v Speaker 1>right are relatively close together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't so obsessed with their </v>

657
00:34:59.341 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 1>group identities or the extreme types </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

658
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.140
<v Speaker 1>But then with the polarization process </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>

659
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:05.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody locks harder into the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities and then anyone who's.</v>

660
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's anyone who's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsider is viewed with access to </v>

661
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.430
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see the situation with the Jewish </v>

662
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.010
<v Speaker 1>people is complicated too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often successful.</v>

663
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if it's some perverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction between ethnocentrism and </v>

664
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.120
<v Speaker 1>resentment for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the successful,</v>

665
00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:30.121
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drives antisemitism during </v>

666
00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:30.310
<v Speaker 1>polarization processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get,</v>

667
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 1>get a finger organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 1>trying to put my finger on it.</v>

669
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're reaching for it here is this</v>

670
00:35:35.981 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that you suddenly these bursts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of intolerance.</v>

671
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.821
<v Speaker 3>What triggers that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here I turned to Karen Stenner of </v>

672
00:35:43.821 --> 00:35:44.740
<v Speaker 3>political scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work at Princeton,</v>

673
00:35:44.741 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 3>and now she lives in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wrote this brilliant book,</v>

674
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 3>the authoritarian dynamic published in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2005.</v>

675
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.690
<v Speaker 3>And what she says in there is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritarianism is not a stable </v>

676
00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:00.001
<v Speaker 3>personality trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dynamic in which some people got </v>

677
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.240
<v Speaker 3>20 or 30 percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

678
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.920
<v Speaker 3>when they perceive that society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming apart.</v>

679
00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.490
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I study morality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a sense of shared moral order or</v>

681
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.050
<v Speaker 3>at times when we feel that the moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>order is secure,</v>

682
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.780
<v Speaker 3>violations aren't punished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's fine.</v>

683
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are other times when we feel </v>

684
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 3>things are coming apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's chaos,</v>

685
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.080
<v Speaker 3>it's Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that's happening,</v>

686
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.170
<v Speaker 3>people who have this predisposition to </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritarianism,</v>

687
00:36:26.171 --> 00:36:31.171
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a button on their head</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets pushed and they then become </v>

688
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:32.380
<v Speaker 3>intolerant against all outsiders.</v>

689
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.650
<v Speaker 3>And so she does experiments where she </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives a story about,</v>

690
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:37.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's Mexican immigration,</v>

691
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 3>but it turns that that then makes know </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you present it in a threatening way </v>

692
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.051
<v Speaker 3>as Donald Trump does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't just turn people against </v>

693
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns them against lgbt Americans.</v>

694
00:36:48.011 --> 00:36:51.900
<v Speaker 3>So it's a general dynamic of stamp out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>descend,</v>

695
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.970
<v Speaker 3>stamp out the outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back to the purity of our group.</v>

696
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.290
<v Speaker 3>So when we have times of increasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity,</v>

697
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.780
<v Speaker 3>when we have peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's a sense of progress,</v>

698
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:06.170
<v Speaker 3>the pie is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is some sense that we are.</v>

699
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.550
<v Speaker 3>We have something in common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then things get much calmer,</v>

700
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 3>but a number of events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a financial crisis may have contributed </v>

701
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.910
<v Speaker 3>to sense that there is not a growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pie.</v>

702
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 3>But I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media has made it so that if you </v>

703
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.811
<v Speaker 3>are prone to this and then you sign up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to any group that is concerned about </v>

704
00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.730
<v Speaker 3>immigration or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will now be so you will,</v>

705
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 3>it will be come flooding into you really</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful videos designed to press that </v>

706
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.450
<v Speaker 3>button over and over and over again.</v>

707
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.150
<v Speaker 3>And before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America goes from having,</v>

708
00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:39.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 Nazis to having 500,</v>

709
00:37:39.701 --> 00:37:41.740
<v Speaker 3>maybe even 5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not 5 million.</v>

710
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think there are five know</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

711
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not like two or three percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country are Nazis.</v>

712
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.530
<v Speaker 3>So we've got to somehow learn to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to the fact that we've got to </v>

713
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.621
<v Speaker 3>somehow get back to judging by sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the average or the overall rather than </v>

714
00:37:55.621 --> 00:38:00.180
<v Speaker 3>the individual extremes because now we </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be faced with the individual </v>

715
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.620
<v Speaker 3>extremes forever and also while we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommending books.</v>

716
00:38:02.621 --> 00:38:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Amy Chu was political tribes talks a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this too and it's really,</v>

717
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.580
<v Speaker 3>really an interesting stimulating.</v>

718
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Well partly what I've been trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my lectures.</v>

719
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm lecturing to people and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this to some degree on youtube as well </v>

720
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.300
<v Speaker 1>as to emphasize the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coleman Center.</v>

721
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a return to classic liberal and </v>

722
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:25.930
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree classic conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

723
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean some intermingling of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some emphasis on traditional,</v>

724
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.900
<v Speaker 1>well a traditional phenomenon like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like monogamous marriage,</v>

725
00:38:34.901 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>but the</v>

726
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.160
<v Speaker 4>idea of the sovereignty of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual as part of that common </v>

727
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 4>landscape that unites us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that seems to be quite useful.</v>

728
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 4>Although I would go ahead,</v>

729
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.480
<v Speaker 3>just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a very important point </v>

730
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 3>that if you go down the identitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>path,</v>

731
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.980
<v Speaker 3>there is no clear endpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can point to where this will end </v>

732
00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.940
<v Speaker 3>in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's,</v>

733
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:04.790
<v Speaker 3>what's so interesting and here's one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most encouraging signs is that just </v>

734
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.001
<v Speaker 3>in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are seeing an explosion of books </v>

735
00:39:09.001 --> 00:39:12.331
<v Speaker 3>written by people who are not straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>white males who are saying identity </v>

736
00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:14.710
<v Speaker 3>politics practiced in this way is a dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

737
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 3>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to really emphasize what we have</v>

738
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 3>in common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'll just read you.</v>

739
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I just started collecting a file,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put this online someplace soon.</v>

740
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Here are some of the books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's something really interesting </v>

741
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.020
<v Speaker 3>things coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just recently,</v>

742
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Amy Schumer's book political tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Greg mentioned,</v>

743
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 3>a Francis Fukuyama has a new book </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

744
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 3>The demand for dignity and the politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>of resentment just came out last week.</v>

745
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Appiah isn't writing brilliantly</v>

746
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.220
<v Speaker 3>about identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

747
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan Rouch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

748
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

749
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:43.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been writing again very,</v>

750
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about amy Chu and about other reasons </v>

751
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 3>why identity politics is a dead end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John mcwhorter,</v>

752
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been writing brilliantly about how,</v>

753
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti racism has become a religion a how </v>

754
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.190
<v Speaker 3>we need to start focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

755
00:39:59.191 --> 00:40:01.280
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that way I'm in Britain.</v>

756
00:40:01.281 --> 00:40:06.281
<v Speaker 3>There are a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people of Caribbean origin had been </v>

757
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:09.721
<v Speaker 3>writing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had dinner last week with your </v>

758
00:40:09.721 --> 00:40:09.721
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manji has a book coming up.</v>

759
00:40:09.721 --> 00:40:13.921
<v Speaker 3>Don't label me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is wonderful that we're seeing </v>

760
00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:15.160
<v Speaker 3>all of these people just to all of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify as being on the left.</v>

761
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:20.700
<v Speaker 3>None of them are straight white males </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all saying we need to </v>

762
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.390
<v Speaker 3>rethink this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're,</v>

763
00:40:21.391 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 3>we're thrilled because in our book and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chapter three,</v>

764
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 3>we distinguished between common </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>

765
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:30.841
<v Speaker 3>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what Martin Luther King did </v>

766
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:30.841
<v Speaker 3>have any of the civil rights leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which yes,</v>

767
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:32.480
<v Speaker 3>you need to demand rights for groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't have them,</v>

768
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 3>but you do it by appealing to our common</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity versus common enemy identity </v>

769
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what intersectionality tends to</v>

770
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:40.020
<v Speaker 3>devolve into it.</v>

771
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:45.020
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it often is bastardized into let's </v>

772
00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 3>all unite against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

773
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Canada,</v>

774
00:40:48.151 --> 00:40:53.151
<v Speaker 4>we've been pursuing a multicultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy and our prime minister is famous </v>

775
00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:57.591
<v Speaker 4>for saying that Canada has no identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is an absolute catastrophe</v>

776
00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 4>of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

777
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.030
<v Speaker 4>if you think about the multicultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape of the planet,</v>

778
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.630
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly produces records along </v>
<v Speaker 4>with diversity.</v>

779
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 4>So the question is how do you bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>people from different communities into a</v>

780
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:16.340
<v Speaker 4>universal community and maintain piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that you do that </v>

781
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:22.790
<v Speaker 4>essentially by concentrating on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sovereignty of the individual as the </v>

782
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.271
<v Speaker 4>fundamental marker for human identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than rather than the group.</v>

783
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.370
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality,</v>

784
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 4>which I think by the way is a painfully </v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious idea.</v>

785
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:38.351
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you could be classified </v>

786
00:41:38.351 --> 00:41:41.200
<v Speaker 4>among many group dimensions and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if their social status consequences </v>

787
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 4>to all of those and that they interact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

788
00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 4>but I think intersectionality is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually the discovery of the fatal flaw</v>

789
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 4>of identity politics because if you drag</v>
<v Speaker 4>people down,</v>

790
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 4>if you allow their group identities to </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiply and interact and you get to the</v>

791
00:41:56.571 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 4>point where each individual's unique </v>
<v Speaker 4>nexus of group identities.</v>

792
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:05.081
<v Speaker 4>And I actually think that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>western culture discovered over the last</v>

793
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:10.510
<v Speaker 4>several thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the logical end point is the </v>

794
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.851
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you take everyone's advantages </v>

795
00:42:12.851 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 4>and disadvantages into account </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimally,</v>

796
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:19.360
<v Speaker 4>then what you do is you treat them as </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals like there isn't any one </v>

797
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.631
<v Speaker 4>else liked them in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except in terms of their common say </v>

798
00:42:22.631 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 4>divine value or something approximating </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

799
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.150
<v Speaker 3>If you followed it to its logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion,</v>

800
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.600
<v Speaker 3>then the worst aspects of identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>arianism would vanish.</v>

801
00:42:31.601 --> 00:42:36.601
<v Speaker 3>Because as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody ultimately unfortunately of </v>

802
00:42:36.601 --> 00:42:38.950
<v Speaker 3>the 20 or 30 dimensions on which one </v>
<v Speaker 3>could categorize people.</v>

803
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It's really only three to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's straight white males.</v>

804
00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:45.250
<v Speaker 3>That's really where it's at.</v>

805
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 4>We're digging into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

806
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 4>because that that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>illustrative.</v>

807
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.140
<v Speaker 4>I would say to some degree of the actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivations.</v>

808
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.960
<v Speaker 4>There is all these identities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically there's nothing to </v>

809
00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.820
<v Speaker 4>distinguish them in terms of primacy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in terms of their effect,</v>

810
00:42:59.821 --> 00:43:04.821
<v Speaker 4>say on socio economic outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then it seems to me to be a victim </v>

811
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 4>victimizer narrative that's driving the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that it's straight white males,</v>

812
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that in some sense have the,</v>

813
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:15.310
<v Speaker 4>have the phenomenal upper hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is another thing I don't really </v>

814
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:15.310
<v Speaker 4>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

815
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.510
<v Speaker 4>most of the dangerous jobs are done by </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

816
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

817
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.510
<v Speaker 3>who has power and wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:24.450
<v Speaker 3>straight white man can plead guilty to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

819
00:43:24.451 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 3>that the world is not perfectly equal </v>
<v Speaker 3>across all categories.</v>

820
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.080
<v Speaker 3>But I think what we're seeing now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>very sharp relief since the Sarah John </v>

821
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Controversy in New York Times recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this red wine.</v>

822
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Wednesday instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year or two ago.</v>

823
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

824
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.450
<v Speaker 3>there are some people who see inequality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and want to end it.</v>

825
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.410
<v Speaker 3>There are other people who see </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality and want to reverse it.</v>

826
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.840
<v Speaker 3>At the time I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's interesting.</v>

827
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the Sarah John Controversy </v>

828
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.750
<v Speaker 3>where the New York Times hired a young </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korean American,</v>

829
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:59.770
<v Speaker 3>a person to join the opposite of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>editorial page and it was discovered </v>

830
00:44:00.361 --> 00:44:03.840
<v Speaker 3>that she had all these nasty anti white </v>
<v Speaker 3>entryway tweets.</v>

831
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.790
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that there was a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 3>and debate,</v>

832
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.620
<v Speaker 3>many people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

833
00:44:07.621 --> 00:44:09.810
<v Speaker 3>by definition there's no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti white racism.</v>

834
00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:11.850
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to say terrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>white people.</v>

835
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the key thing.</v>

836
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.280
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to look at someone and based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the way they look,</v>

837
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:22.110
<v Speaker 3>dislike them and treat them badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you think that's okay,</v>

838
00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:26.910
<v Speaker 3>then this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is common enemy identity politics.</v>

839
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't be judging people based on </v>

840
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 3>their race then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably supportive comments,</v>

841
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics as well.</v>

842
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I actually would like to push back </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the idea that it's just straight</v>

843
00:44:39.801 --> 00:44:44.801
<v Speaker 2>white men anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I always feel like </v>

844
00:44:44.801 --> 00:44:47.440
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like the Stanford Palo Alto </v>

845
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Slash San Francisco Bay area is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately way ahead on these trends.</v>

846
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are seeing pushback from minority </v>

847
00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:59.381
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's partially because for a long </v>

848
00:44:59.381 --> 00:44:59.381
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least among the friends,</v>

849
00:44:59.381 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe in this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a religious kind of way.</v>

850
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

851
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.590
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're extremely guilty about simply </v>

852
00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 2>being cisgendered as a non transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

853
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see sort of this call out culture</v>

854
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.380
<v Speaker 2>applied to a straight black men for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

855
00:45:12.381 --> 00:45:17.381
<v Speaker 2>So I do think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been falling deeper and deeper </v>

856
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:17.381
<v Speaker 2>down the rabbit hole where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>

857
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.850
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is just a permanent situation of</v>

858
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.140
<v Speaker 2>guilt and shame about an identity that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no control over.</v>

859
00:45:24.141 --> 00:45:25.520
<v Speaker 2>That can't possibly be right.</v>

860
00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing we can point out too is </v>

861
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.121
<v Speaker 1>that even if you do make allowances for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that let's say on average </v>

862
00:45:34.221 --> 00:45:38.480
<v Speaker 1>straight white men are doing or have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done relatively well economically,</v>

863
00:45:38.481 --> 00:45:43.481
<v Speaker 1>it's also very much worth pointing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a tiny minority of straight </v>

864
00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:45.830
<v Speaker 1>white men who have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly well.</v>

865
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have a distribution problem </v>

866
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.070
<v Speaker 1>within each with each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within each ethnic identity group.</v>

867
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And so to say that because on average </v>
<v Speaker 1>the socioeconomic status of a given </v>

868
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.250
<v Speaker 1>group is higher than the status of </v>
<v Speaker 1>another group.</v>

869
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:06.370
<v Speaker 1>All of the people who are members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that group are disproportionately </v>

870
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.150
<v Speaker 1>benefiting is actually a rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

871
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say a rather motivated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful analysis because it is always </v>

872
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.251
<v Speaker 1>a tiny proportion of people in a group </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are doing spectacularly well and </v>

873
00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:21.711
<v Speaker 1>then then you have to do something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you have to look at that </v>

874
00:46:21.711 --> 00:46:26.170
<v Speaker 1>proportion that are doing spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and you have to decide about how </v>

875
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.080
<v Speaker 1>many of them are doing well because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually deserve it and how many of them</v>

876
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:35.081
<v Speaker 1>are doing well because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate rent seekers and I would </v>

877
00:46:35.081 --> 00:46:38.561
<v Speaker 1>say because our culture is pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional and because we do generate a </v>

878
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:41.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of wealth along with the inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a fair number of people who</v>

879
00:46:41.511 --> 00:46:46.511
<v Speaker 1>are doing just proportionately well who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing that by benefiting everyone </v>

880
00:46:46.511 --> 00:46:50.141
<v Speaker 1>else and we're not very careful about </v>
<v Speaker 1>making those sorts of distinctions and </v>

881
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:50.141
<v Speaker 1>they're actually crucial.</v>

882
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we did.</v>

883
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:56.530
<v Speaker 3>So in chapter 11 we go into social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice and many people have claimed </v>

884
00:46:57.041 --> 00:47:00.490
<v Speaker 3>social justice is a meaningless term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets thrown around in certain ways.</v>

885
00:47:00.491 --> 00:47:03.070
<v Speaker 3>People can't define it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm digging into it.</v>

886
00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:05.950
<v Speaker 3>We decided that it actually is </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful,</v>

887
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:10.951
<v Speaker 3>but we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to break it down into its </v>

888
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:13.471
<v Speaker 3>component parts and so we go into what </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the psychology of justice and if you </v>

889
00:47:14.021 --> 00:47:19.021
<v Speaker 3>focus on distributive justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't people getting what they deserve </v>

890
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.351
<v Speaker 3>based on their inputs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody recognizes when people are </v>

891
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:22.351
<v Speaker 3>being cheated that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

892
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:24.310
<v Speaker 3>like in America now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of low wage workers,</v>

893
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.570
<v Speaker 3>the companies have found ways to skimp </v>
<v Speaker 3>on benefits and pay,</v>

894
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>so that is a violation of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributive fairness.</v>

895
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 3>People recognize that that is wrong if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is disproportionately affecting one</v>

896
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>race or if people are being cheated </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are members of any identity</v>

897
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

898
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 3>That is a violation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

899
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:46.771
<v Speaker 3>of social justice or injustice applied </v>
<v Speaker 3>to identity groups that we think is a </v>

900
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 3>very important concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simply procedural justice.</v>

901
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:54.400
<v Speaker 3>If the criminal justice system ends up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

902
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.700
<v Speaker 3>getting better representation to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups than others or treating people </v>

903
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 3>differently at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a violation of justice,</v>

904
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 3>which can possibly quality violation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice.</v>

905
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 3>What we pushed back against is the shift</v>
<v Speaker 3>in recent years to this obsessive </v>

906
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.660
<v Speaker 3>emphasis on outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social justice argument seems to be on </v>

907
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 3>campus as you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

908
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 3>men are overrepresented among coders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

909
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 3>they're not overrepresented among all </v>
<v Speaker 3>other functions at Google and apple.</v>

910
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 3>If you look at everyone else in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

911
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 3>you know it's 50 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're very close.</v>

912
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.790
<v Speaker 3>It's only in certain job classifications</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a disparity and so people </v>

913
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.590
<v Speaker 3>take that as ipso facto proof of </v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic sexism,</v>

914
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 3>but we really push back hard on saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's lazy.</v>

915
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 3>That's unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's inaccurate.</v>

916
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.710
<v Speaker 3>That's an invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those disparities or an invitation to </v>

917
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 3>look closer and if you see that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pipeline is 50 slash 50,</v>

918
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 3>but the outcome is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you've got a strong case.</v>

919
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 3>But if the pipeline from Grad programs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and computer science is exactly the same</v>

920
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 3>as the representation among coders at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google and apple,</v>

921
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:04.170
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do something to show that </v>

922
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.571
<v Speaker 3>people are being treated differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we think there's a lot of bad </v>

923
00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:09.361
<v Speaker 3>thinking gun in the service of </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecuting one's political agenda </v>

924
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:11.710
<v Speaker 3>within the culture war and that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know how to stand up to it.</v>

925
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:16.770
<v Speaker 3>And one thing that I find interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>but district become a blast from this </v>

926
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.590
<v Speaker 3>argument is a personal preference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly when people talk about </v>

927
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 3>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if you've ever actually read,</v>

928
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speech that got Larry Summers and so</v>

929
00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:28.411
<v Speaker 3>much trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly conclusion is it's probably </v>

930
00:49:28.411 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 3>mostly that these are not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these jobs are not our job.</v>

931
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the theoretical physics things,</v>

932
00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a lot of appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

933
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he basically,</v>

934
00:49:36.781 --> 00:49:41.781
<v Speaker 3>he comes down for some reason saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there might actually be a reason </v>

935
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 3>why no veterinary sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly women,</v>

936
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 3>some of some of these mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields are overwhelming.</v>

937
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Mimic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have something to do with it.</v>

938
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 3>Some small differences in what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually liked doing somehow.</v>

939
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:59.510
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest London Times just did an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article this week on two papers that </v>

940
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:00.050
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

941
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:06.050
<v Speaker 1>was quite an interesting article because</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the papers came out showing once </v>

942
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:09.000
<v Speaker 1>again that the personality differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women are largest in the</v>

943
00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:14.001
<v Speaker 1>most egalitarian societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they actually get quite large by </v>

944
00:50:14.001 --> 00:50:16.770
<v Speaker 1>psychological standards in countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Holland or the Netherlands.</v>

945
00:50:16.771 --> 00:50:21.771
<v Speaker 1>And also in the Scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the most egalitarian </v>

946
00:50:21.771 --> 00:50:24.771
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest difference between men </v>

947
00:50:24.771 --> 00:50:27.471
<v Speaker 1>and women and also one that grows in </v>
<v Speaker 1>more egalitarian countries is an </v>

948
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 1>interest and that that</v>

949
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 4>difference is more than the standard </v>
<v Speaker 4>deviation.</v>

950
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like one and a half standard </v>
<v Speaker 4>deviations.</v>

951
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 4>And so it's more than enough to account </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the disparity between male engineers</v>

952
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 4>and our female engineers and male </v>
<v Speaker 4>nurses.</v>

953
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:47.470
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that it grows as societies </v>
<v Speaker 4>become more egalitarian is actually a </v>

954
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 4>death blow to social constructionist </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>

955
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:49.960
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

956
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:54.970
<v Speaker 3>so let's go into this because this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really helpful area where I think we </v>

957
00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 3>have a good idea what's going on and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can see why it's so hard to find.</v>

958
00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Find the truth here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

959
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:04.240
<v Speaker 3>so when I taught at Uva,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lecture on sex and gender and I </v>

960
00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:10.021
<v Speaker 3>went into sex differences and have clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding for many decades is that if you </v>

961
00:51:10.021 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 3>look at differences in ability between </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women,</v>

962
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 3>they're very few and far between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men are better at spacial rotation.</v>

963
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Women on some images are a little bit or</v>
<v Speaker 3>at social skills and language.</v>

964
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 3>So there are some differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're few and far between.</v>

965
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:28.810
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the differences in what </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids like and what they choose to do </v>

966
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:33.311
<v Speaker 3>when there's no adult watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their huge little boys and girls play </v>

967
00:51:33.311 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 3>radically differently by my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

968
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we once gave up my triplet nephews and </v>

969
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.151
<v Speaker 3>they were four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years old again from a bag of </v>

970
00:51:42.151 --> 00:51:44.341
<v Speaker 3>plastic dinosaurs and the two boys </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed a dinosaur and they start </v>

971
00:51:44.341 --> 00:51:47.671
<v Speaker 3>battling the bashing them together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the girl takes two dinosaurs and she </v>

972
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ever leave me money.</v>

973
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 3>I won't be so dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is girls and boys play </v>

974
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>really differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

975
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:59.710
<v Speaker 3>if they're supervised by adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the differences get smaller was if you </v>

976
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Speaker 3>let kids play on their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the differences get bigger.</v>

977
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Differences in interest are huge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crucial.</v>

978
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Finding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

979
00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.010
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to ask you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

980
00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 3>why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think this is treated so </v>

981
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:12.090
<v Speaker 3>much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like heretical.</v>

982
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Bless was thought that must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately shot down,</v>

983
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.660
<v Speaker 4>that you zeroed in on the property issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

984
00:52:17.661 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 4>When you talked about the equity Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

985
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:24.791
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out is how we know when the left </v>

986
00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:28.040
<v Speaker 4>goes too far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we know when the right goes too far,</v>

987
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:31.280
<v Speaker 4>when they start making ethno nationalist</v>
<v Speaker 4>claims of superiority.</v>

988
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.400
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that and claiming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that all the good things should happen </v>

989
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.180
<v Speaker 4>to one ethnic or racial group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

990
00:52:38.181 --> 00:52:43.181
<v Speaker 4>Know where you're outside the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable political discourse at that </v>

991
00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:47.261
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now obviously the same thing can happen </v>

992
00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:47.261
<v Speaker 4>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it happens,</v>

993
00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 4>it's not so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no smoking pistol,</v>

994
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.220
<v Speaker 4>but I think emphasis on equity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is code word for equality of </v>

995
00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.720
<v Speaker 4>outcome is actually the smoking pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to pick one.</v>

996
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:57.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

997
00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I would disagree with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can't be a smoking pistol.</v>

998
00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Emphasizing equity can't get smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pistol,</v>

999
00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I think we mean by smoking pistol is </v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone makes an argument in good </v>

1000
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.921
<v Speaker 3>faith trying to understand some </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon in the world and they suffer </v>

1001
00:53:11.921 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Speaker 3>social consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the smoking pistol.</v>

1002
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Why we might be talking about two </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly different things.</v>

1003
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm maybe not.</v>

1004
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:25.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to figure out where the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the tipping point is on the left </v>

1005
00:53:26.081 --> 00:53:31.081
<v Speaker 4>that makes things spiral out of control </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you guys talked about the equality </v>

1006
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 4>of outcome doctrine as as the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1007
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.610
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't allow for multivariate </v>
<v Speaker 4>analysis.</v>

1008
00:53:37.611 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is a big problem,</v>

1009
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:44.031
<v Speaker 4>so it oversimplifies things radically if</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference in outcome than </v>

1010
00:53:44.031 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 4>ipso facto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a victim,</v>

1011
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:50.181
<v Speaker 4>victimizer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a narrative driving it or reality </v>

1012
00:53:50.181 --> 00:53:52.770
<v Speaker 4>driving it and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1013
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:58.060
<v Speaker 4>the fundamental problem on the radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>left is exactly that and that's the </v>

1014
00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 4>reason that they don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature on gender differences because</v>

1015
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:07.910
<v Speaker 4>you can point to gender differences in </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome and you can use them as proof </v>

1016
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 4>for the oppressive nature of society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look into it and you find out</v>

1017
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 4>that that's actually not proof that some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the differences,</v>

1018
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:20.330
<v Speaker 4>even some of the differences in outcome </v>
<v Speaker 4>are being driven by things like </v>

1019
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 4>biological difference in interest than </v>
<v Speaker 4>it radically weakens that central </v>

1020
00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 4>axiomatic claim of fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppression.</v>

1021
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:31.521
<v Speaker 4>And so that's viewed as an existential </v>
<v Speaker 4>threat by people for whom that's the </v>

1022
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 4>cardinal presupposition is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it looks to me.</v>

1023
00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 3>That is correct since since reading the </v>
<v Speaker 3>righteous mind,</v>

1024
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:42.720
<v Speaker 3>I always like to analyze things in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what sacred,</v>

1025
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.660
<v Speaker 3>organized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They circle around it,</v>

1026
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:50.661
<v Speaker 3>that binds them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of things that people </v>

1027
00:54:50.661 --> 00:54:50.661
<v Speaker 3>hold sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1028
00:54:50.661 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 3>on all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am struck by the fact that in the </v>

1029
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 3>academy it's not just questioning sacred</v>
<v Speaker 3>values of any sort.</v>

1030
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It's specifically questioning diversity </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies.</v>

1031
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:04.611
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to do and that does fit with what </v>

1032
00:55:04.611 --> 00:55:07.011
<v Speaker 3>you said that it's like it's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>project that we're all engaged in and </v>

1033
00:55:07.011 --> 00:55:11.541
<v Speaker 3>we'll working hard against the enemy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fighting the fight and if one of </v>

1034
00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:15.291
<v Speaker 3>us steps out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually maybe we'll wrong on this </v>

1035
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:15.291
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1036
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:16.220
<v Speaker 3>we've got to shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't have got to shooter.</v>

1037
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:21.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that probability would be </v>

1038
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.410
<v Speaker 4>proportionate to the centrality of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>axiom.</v>

1039
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I think the central axiom here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it's causing all the trouble,</v>

1040
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:30.790
<v Speaker 4>is the insistence that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>insistence's one.</v>

1041
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:35.791
<v Speaker 4>Is that the best way to characterize </v>
<v Speaker 4>Western society as an oppressive </v>

1042
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:35.791
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy?</v>

1043
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:36.550
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1044
00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.160
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1045
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:42.270
<v Speaker 4>and the second is that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>characterize people is by their group </v>

1046
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.300
<v Speaker 4>and those two things interact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the gender data is particularly a</v>

1047
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:52.150
<v Speaker 4>horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say to people who hold those </v>

1048
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.150
<v Speaker 4>axioms because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1049
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:55.840
<v Speaker 4>for two reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is because the gender differences </v>

1050
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.910
<v Speaker 4>actually exist and they do account for </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences in outcome,</v>

1051
00:55:56.911 --> 00:55:59.300
<v Speaker 4>but even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a catastrophe,</v>

1052
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I think for the social constructionist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that as you put egalitarian social </v>

1053
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:09.461
<v Speaker 4>policies into play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the very differences that you hate </v>

1054
00:56:09.461 --> 00:56:10.220
<v Speaker 4>get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1055
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:13.700
<v Speaker 4>and this needs to be said a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>times because it really is,</v>

1056
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fatal blow to the social </v>

1057
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.030
<v Speaker 4>constructionist egalitarianism and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the concepts they're using.</v>

1058
00:56:20.031 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Because one thing we could also ask is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1059
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if turns out that men and women are as </v>

1060
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 4>different in egalitarianism societies as</v>
<v Speaker 4>boys and girls are in there,</v>

1061
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 4>unsupervised play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is a reasonable analog,</v>

1062
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.880
<v Speaker 4>then we're going to have differences in </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome that are going to be magnified </v>

1063
00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.750
<v Speaker 4>by the very policies that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>egalitarian or putting in place.</v>

1064
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 4>And then we also might ask to his inner </v>
<v Speaker 4>truly,</v>

1065
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this society that we want to set up,</v>

1066
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.280
<v Speaker 4>maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case that people's free choice would </v>

1067
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.991
<v Speaker 4>determine their occupational outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we have to put up with a </v>

1068
00:56:57.991 --> 00:56:59.800
<v Speaker 4>certain degree of inequality of outcome </v>
<v Speaker 4>and think in a complex way about it.</v>

1069
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:06.690
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about about sacredness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the stories we talked about </v>

1070
00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:12.571
<v Speaker 2>in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're very well familiar with </v>

1071
00:57:12.571 --> 00:57:14.970
<v Speaker 2>the Rebecca to bell story paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an academic paper talking about,</v>

1072
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we accept transsexuality,</v>

1073
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.940
<v Speaker 2>what implications does that have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Rachel woke,</v>

1074
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:26.180
<v Speaker 2>kind of wants to decide what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

1075
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 2>what a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She claimed that she was black heels,</v>

1076
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:32.720
<v Speaker 2>black inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1077
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:34.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and both John and I are very,</v>

1078
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 2>we've really tried to sort of be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable as possible,</v>

1079
00:57:38.171 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 2>aggressively reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1080
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this one we,</v>

1081
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:41.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1082
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.770
<v Speaker 2>we liken it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1083
00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 2>a male Durkheim's definition of witch </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunts because it really,</v>

1084
00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:48.770
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately really set because you not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only do you have this kind of like,</v>

1085
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like normal,</v>

1086
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:55.291
<v Speaker 2>interesting intellectual exercise of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic article and making an </v>

1087
00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:55.291
<v Speaker 2>interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1088
00:57:55.291 --> 00:58:00.010
<v Speaker 2>she's treated absolutely like a blast </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer and so badly that people are </v>

1089
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.750
<v Speaker 2>signing letters condemning her while at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time emailing saying,</v>

1090
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really terrible what happened to</v>

1091
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1092
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just absolutely bizarre and </v>

1093
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 2>scary as the smoking gun proves that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem is when there are </v>

1094
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.751
<v Speaker 2>social consequences to make good faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>are out in the public square.</v>

1095
00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the comments section on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>

1096
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:21.010
<v Speaker 2>of course we're trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

1097
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:26.011
<v Speaker 2>is this really unique and important </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing which is create an environment in </v>

1098
00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 2>which people are expected to challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1099
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.590
<v Speaker 2>We're not supposed to be there to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable and it all makes sense.</v>

1100
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It's all okay because it's the surface </v>
<v Speaker 2>service of finding truth.</v>

1101
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as people who are taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>part in that process are shamed,</v>

1102
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 2>punished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excluded,</v>

1103
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>there calls to expel them or punish </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1104
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.820
<v Speaker 2>as soon as that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we have more of a sort of east </v>

1105
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.210
<v Speaker 2>German mindset where people are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about what's true,</v>

1106
00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.430
<v Speaker 2>what will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will avoid getting in trouble,</v>

1108
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:56.431
<v Speaker 2>what am I allowed to say by the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what will get me incredible praise for </v>

1109
00:58:56.681 --> 00:58:58.710
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing myself as a true believer.</v>

1110
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Tremendous amount of authority is </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated by the desire to avoid being </v>

1111
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.540
<v Speaker 4>shunned and treated as the violator up </v>
<v Speaker 4>at taboo because that's exactly what's </v>

1112
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:13.150
<v Speaker 4>happening is that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are new taboos.</v>

1113
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 4>So then part of the question might be to</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is there such an insistence that the</v>

1114
00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 4>culture we live in is a patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyranny,</v>

1115
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 4>which is also a collapse of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1116
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously our culture has its flaws.</v>

1117
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tends towards,</v>

1118
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:32.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rigidity and tyranny,</v>

1119
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:35.720
<v Speaker 4>like all cultures do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But comparatively speaking,</v>

1120
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.890
<v Speaker 4>as we've talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

1121
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:41.210
<v Speaker 4>by world standards today or by world </v>
<v Speaker 4>standards,</v>

1122
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:43.620
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty damn free and,</v>

1123
00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:48.780
<v Speaker 4>and productive culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have this tremendous emphasis on </v>

1124
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 4>the idea that it's fundamentally a </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1125
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:56.501
<v Speaker 4>and that if you a question that then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're treated as a taboo violator.</v>

1126
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 4>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1127
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is driving this insistence</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a patriarchal purity with,</v>

1128
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 4>with Kate Millett?</v>

1129
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see who originated,</v>

1130
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 4>at least in part patriarchy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that she had a very,</v>

1131
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:16.330
<v Speaker 4>she had an alcoholic and abusive father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that's quite interesting </v>

1132
01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.440
<v Speaker 4>because I think there are psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamics here at work.</v>

1133
01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:23.441
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder to what degree the people who </v>

1134
01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:23.441
<v Speaker 4>are pushing this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1135
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 4>have had very disturbed interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships,</v>

1136
01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 4>gender relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1137
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what would you say driving the </v>

1138
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.710
<v Speaker 4>collapse of their political viewpoint in</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a single dimension like a single </v>

1139
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.971
<v Speaker 4>oversimplified dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that sort of oversimplified </v>

1140
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:42.971
<v Speaker 4>thinking when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

1141
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at psychopathological complexes,</v>

1142
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with,</v>

1143
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:47.620
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1144
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with women,</v>

1145
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:50.840
<v Speaker 4>with eating disorders in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what men too.</v>

1146
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:53.900
<v Speaker 4>But that's rarer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything collapses to a single,</v>

1147
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a single dimension of evaluation.</v>

1148
01:00:56.841 --> 01:00:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Something like thin equals beautiful or </v>
<v Speaker 4>thin equals good.</v>

1149
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 4>And then that drives everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1150
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.400
<v Speaker 4>and then I also think maybe it is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>also a challenge too to cultural </v>

1151
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 4>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an actual intellectual challenge.</v>

1152
01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we think that your,</v>

1153
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your way of,</v>

1154
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.780
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1155
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.640
<v Speaker 4>of operating within the culture is too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too radical.</v>

1156
01:01:20.641 --> 01:01:25.641
<v Speaker 4>That we're going to throw everything we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can at you and an attempt to make you </v>

1157
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:26.800
<v Speaker 4>prove that that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

1158
01:01:26.801 --> 01:01:29.330
<v Speaker 4>I can't get any farther underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The math.</v>

1159
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.590
<v Speaker 3>So you're a clinical psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think your first impulse is let's </v>

1160
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:35.590
<v Speaker 3>look to the person's formative </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1161
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Why do they think this way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a social psychologist.</v>

1162
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.600
<v Speaker 3>So I think in terms of if there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>new or some interesting social movement,</v>

1163
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.080
<v Speaker 3>what are the social forces and pressures</v>
<v Speaker 3>on them that led them to think this way?</v>

1164
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I also read a lot and think a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

1165
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what first drew me to you.</v>

1166
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:56.251
<v Speaker 3>You went through when I met in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both loved Carl young and I love this</v>

1167
01:01:56.430 --> 01:02:00.990
<v Speaker 3>idea of archetypes interpreted from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary point of view as to like,</v>

1168
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.140
<v Speaker 3>why do we dream about dragons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do so many cultures have dragons?</v>

1169
01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1170
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ancestors,</v>

1171
01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:07.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 million years ago,</v>

1172
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:09.520
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in a world of dinosaurs.</v>

1173
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.400
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's right.</v>

1174
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm human beings have a tendency to </v>

1175
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.280
<v Speaker 3>think in a manichaean style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's effortless.</v>

1176
01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 3>It's default for us to divide the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>into good and evil.</v>

1177
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:24.951
<v Speaker 3>And that's why the third grade on truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our book is the untruth of US versus </v>

1178
01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is a battle between good people and</v>

1179
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 3>evil people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to teach this to people.</v>

1180
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1181
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:38.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we think that is innate as a </v>

1182
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.771
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is why are some </v>

1183
01:02:39.771 --> 01:02:41.961
<v Speaker 3>movements now teaching this and why is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it making more progress in some areas </v>

1184
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 3>the university now than it was 10 or 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago?</v>

1185
01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that,</v>

1186
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.300
<v Speaker 3>to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were engaged in a,</v>

1187
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 3>in a radical program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radical means you want to tear things </v>

1188
01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want radical change,</v>

1189
01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 3>you need to demonize the country to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

1190
01:02:57.571 --> 01:03:02.571
<v Speaker 3>You want to tear down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to say that America is the </v>

1191
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:02.571
<v Speaker 3>worst.</v>

1192
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 3>America is a paragon of racism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexism.</v>

1193
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And of course we have our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1194
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:10.431
<v Speaker 3>most of us think that things have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting steadily better since the 19th </v>

1195
01:03:10.431 --> 01:03:10.431
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1196
01:03:10.431 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 3>but you're committed to saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>America is the worst.</v>

1197
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:15.000
<v Speaker 3>So there was an interesting study </v>
<v Speaker 3>published a few months ago,</v>

1198
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 3>if you've probably heard about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rent America as like the,</v>

1199
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 3>like the twelfth worst country on earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>for women.</v>

1200
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:23.220
<v Speaker 3>It was behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1201
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:28.221
<v Speaker 3>Eritrea and Sudan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea know it was the one of the </v>

1202
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Speaker 3>worst places on earth to be a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1203
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.110
<v Speaker 3>just on the smell test and really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1204
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go into why that's so </v>

1205
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the methodology it was,</v>

1206
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 3>it was judged by her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what it was.</v>

1207
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 3>But despite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it was in the judgment of like</v>

1208
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 3>human rights activists or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1209
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 3>rights activists are generally many of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1210
01:03:47.371 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 3>and just American human rights activist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was something like that.</v>

1211
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.130
<v Speaker 3>They are not weighing up statistics on </v>
<v Speaker 3>how women fare around the world.</v>

1212
01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.870
<v Speaker 3>They're being asked what are the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries for women?</v>

1213
01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 3>And if you were engaged in the project </v>
<v Speaker 3>of critique in America,</v>

1214
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you're motivated to say that America is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst.</v>

1215
01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's explained that ranking</v>

1216
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:13.270
<v Speaker 4>that justifies your continued activism </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if that's what you've staked your </v>

1217
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.670
<v Speaker 4>career on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's also necessary.</v>

1218
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.820
<v Speaker 4>I also think that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's driving all of the things that </v>

1219
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.811
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>produced a committed activists class </v>

1220
01:04:22.811 --> 01:04:26.561
<v Speaker 4>that has been heavily subsidized for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years and they are always in need of </v>

1221
01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.120
<v Speaker 4>reasons to justify their continued </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>

1222
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1223
01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.400
<v Speaker 4>as we all are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1224
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.700
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is a situation where that's </v>

1225
01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:36.700
<v Speaker 4>become dangerous,</v>

1226
01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.570
<v Speaker 3>committed activists class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1227
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I think this is important also to focus </v>
<v Speaker 3>on for a moment because in discussions </v>

1228
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all supposed to praise the </v>

1229
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 3>students political activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all supposed to praise activism,</v>

1230
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1231
01:04:47.861 --> 01:04:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Pepsi tried that disastrous commercial </v>
<v Speaker 3>of just like,</v>

1232
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>random beautiful people being activist </v>

1233
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>because if you have a bullhorn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullhorn,</v>

1234
01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 3>that's political activity goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there is an idea among young </v>

1235
01:05:03.251 --> 01:05:08.251
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is I think more true on the </v>

1236
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:09.661
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to be political is to be </v>

1237
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:12.631
<v Speaker 3>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just telling me like why is it that the </v>

1238
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:12.631
<v Speaker 3>right when they're upset about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1239
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.430
<v Speaker 3>they go and they get people to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>school board and they changed the rules.</v>

1240
01:05:15.431 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the right I think is more pragmatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>in its politics.</v>

1241
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.070
<v Speaker 3>The left is more expressive and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a point that Mark Lilla has been</v>

1242
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 3>made so ultimately ends up backfiring.</v>

1243
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.630
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1244
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the respect that we accord to activism,</v>

1245
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:36.841
<v Speaker 3>pure and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that should be rethought and I </v>

1246
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:42.990
<v Speaker 3>might be about to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One President of a major university in </v>

1247
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:47.681
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this region recently said something </v>

1248
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:49.690
<v Speaker 3>to the effect that universities are </v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming ungovernable now.</v>

1249
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They face a lot of pressures,</v>

1250
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.600
<v Speaker 3>but the student activism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it's,</v>

1251
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be anything.</v>

1252
01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:01.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not addressed at injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's addressed at something in the </v>

1253
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:01.950
<v Speaker 3>dining hall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that a student,</v>

1254
01:06:01.951 --> 01:06:06.951
<v Speaker 3>but it's because there are protests </v>
<v Speaker 3>about almost anything I think many </v>

1255
01:06:06.951 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 3>administrators are realizing what have </v>
<v Speaker 3>we done,</v>

1256
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:11.920
<v Speaker 3>what kind of Frankenstein monster have </v>
<v Speaker 3>we created by incentivizing and praising</v>

1257
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:13.760
<v Speaker 3>this kind of of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1258
01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 3>of activism.</v>

1259
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.660
<v Speaker 4>Our whole being talking to politicians </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Canada about the possibility of </v>

1260
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:25.640
<v Speaker 4>making a distinction between education </v>
<v Speaker 4>and activism and political activism.</v>

1261
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:29.910
<v Speaker 4>So you know in Canada if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>charitable organization,</v>

1262
01:06:29.911 --> 01:06:32.880
<v Speaker 4>you can't engage in political activism </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1263
01:06:32.881 --> 01:06:37.881
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 4>between what might constitute education </v>

1264
01:06:37.881 --> 01:06:42.351
<v Speaker 4>and what might constitute activism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that there's something </v>

1265
01:06:42.351 --> 01:06:43.890
<v Speaker 4>intrinsically moral and noble about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1266
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.200
<v Speaker 4>about complaining about the evil people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world is definitely something you</v>

1267
01:06:49.201 --> 01:06:54.201
<v Speaker 4>don't want literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The humanities used to be the antidote </v>

1268
01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:57.441
<v Speaker 4>to that to some degree because one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that characterize is great </v>

1269
01:06:57.441 --> 01:07:01.491
<v Speaker 4>literature as opposed to secondary </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature is that if the literature is </v>

1270
01:07:01.491 --> 01:07:06.440
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the battle between good and evil occurs </v>

1271
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:06.440
<v Speaker 4>in the hearts of each protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1272
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a psychological issue and not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sociological issue.</v>

1273
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm turning here to our opening quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1274
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.300
<v Speaker 3>and we already talked about one instance</v>
<v Speaker 3>of one of our three opening quotes,</v>

1275
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.690
<v Speaker 3>the line dividing good and evil cuts </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the heart of every human being.</v>

1276
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And that is what we should be teaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>students to complexify situation to the </v>

1277
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.370
<v Speaker 3>extent that we teach them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1278
01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:33.350
<v Speaker 3>it's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know the category,</v>

1279
01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:35.570
<v Speaker 3>you know their moral valence and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know there are bad.</v>

1280
01:07:35.571 --> 01:07:40.571
<v Speaker 3>And so you've sent that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are teaching students to think in </v>

1281
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:40.571
<v Speaker 3>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are harming them.</v>

1282
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:43.360
<v Speaker 3>You're setting them up for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are preparing them for citizenship in</v>

1283
01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:46.880
<v Speaker 3>a democracy and we are harming the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future of our country.</v>

1284
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.020
<v Speaker 3>And I probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a</v>

1285
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:51.270
<v Speaker 2>little bit of insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a as a first amendment lawyer,</v>

1286
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:56.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone who's spent a lot of time </v>

1287
01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.041
<v Speaker 2>defending the rights protestors and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with very many protestors who were</v>

1288
01:07:58.801 --> 01:08:03.801
<v Speaker 2>protesting utterly sensible things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like absolutely more power to you.</v>

1289
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.120
<v Speaker 2>But also I've talked to other people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt were tilting at windmills or,</v>

1290
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.880
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1291
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:11.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time representative group that was,</v>

1292
01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>or Algebra represented group that </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that the US should have no navy</v>

1293
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that you think we should </v>

1294
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>spend less on military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should literally have no navy.</v>

1295
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And that was the argument and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask some of my activist friends in San </v>

1296
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were doing,</v>

1297
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I think particularly with criminal </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and that kind of stuff,</v>

1298
01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>but another case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd see sort of activists sort of </v>

1299
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>groups that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opposed the second Iraq war.</v>

1301
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had friends who also oppose it </v>

1302
01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.400
<v Speaker 2>would immediately go into a and nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 was a conspiracy to,</v>

1303
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.230
<v Speaker 2>to allow for the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1304
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>why are you moving it to that next </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument where you're going to lose more</v>

1305
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:57.761
<v Speaker 2>people and the perception was that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to keep the temperature at boiling </v>

1306
01:08:57.761 --> 01:09:02.081
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to keep it a to 12 or else </v>

1307
01:09:02.081 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 2>people will lose interest and I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>to in pinker is actually more correct on</v>

1308
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:09.371
<v Speaker 2>this is that we're actually creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually through some some of the </v>

1309
01:09:09.371 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 2>postmodern is thoughts that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating,</v>

1310
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 2>a situation in which actually progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>is more or less hopeless and all you can</v>

1311
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:18.230
<v Speaker 2>really do a shout about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually makes people more cynical</v>

1312
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:22.880
<v Speaker 2>and does less to achieve your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas as pinker likes to point out,</v>

1313
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:24.260
<v Speaker 2>if we actually look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1314
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.020
<v Speaker 2>what did we do that actually works and </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to keep doing that,</v>

1315
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.280
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a better bet for actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress knowing.</v>

1316
01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:35.450
<v Speaker 4>Welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perverse thing there too is that I </v>

1317
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:35.680
<v Speaker 4>believe this to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

1318
01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.060
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned that there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 4>variety of books coming out.</v>

1319
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I could get that list and post </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in the description of this youtube </v>

1320
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.650
<v Speaker 4>video that might be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also a whole string of books</v>

1321
01:09:46.651 --> 01:09:50.700
<v Speaker 4>that's been published lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including Steven Pinker's book,</v>

1322
01:09:50.701 --> 01:09:55.701
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now showing that the rate of economic </v>

1323
01:09:55.701 --> 01:09:59.361
<v Speaker 4>progress around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with regard to lifting the </v>

1324
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.451
<v Speaker 4>abjectly poor out of poverty is </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing at an unparalleled rate and </v>

1325
01:10:03.181 --> 01:10:07.440
<v Speaker 4>that might be a secondary benefit to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse of communism since 1989.</v>

1326
01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 4>A lot of things are driving it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but certainly some of it is the spread </v>

1327
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:16.191
<v Speaker 4>of ideas of individual sovereignty and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the use of free market policies by </v>

1328
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:18.530
<v Speaker 4>developing countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just as we see the,</v>

1329
01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:23.860
<v Speaker 4>the landscape for poor around the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be radically improved during this </v>

1330
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:28.731
<v Speaker 4>process and the west of criticizing our </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental principles to the point </v>

1331
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:28.731
<v Speaker 4>where we're.</v>

1332
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:30.960
<v Speaker 4>We're driving a dangerous level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>polarization.</v>

1333
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 4>And so that's our very perverse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange situation and difficult to </v>

1334
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:36.900
<v Speaker 4>contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1335
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.480
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1336
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:39.290
<v Speaker 4>let's switch a bit here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of left.</v>

1337
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So while we see the problem,</v>

1338
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:48.830
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that we're still </v>
<v Speaker 4>sketching it out and trying to </v>

1339
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 4>articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's something like the rise of a,</v>

1340
01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 4>a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>victimizer culture that might be driven </v>

1341
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.971
<v Speaker 4>by young people's increasing sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability as a consequence of the </v>

1342
01:10:59.971 --> 01:11:04.830
<v Speaker 4>unexamined effects of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big polarization driven by tendency </v>

1343
01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:11.050
<v Speaker 4>for a dying media to come to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 4>on extremism,</v>

1344
01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 4>the domination of the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>discourse in the universities by the </v>

1345
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:21.470
<v Speaker 4>left and the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these things are playing together </v>

1346
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 4>and they're causing a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble,</v>

1347
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:27.771
<v Speaker 4>like the rise of this excessive safety </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture that has negative psychological </v>

1348
01:11:27.771 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1349
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:32.580
<v Speaker 4>that's all dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we do about it,</v>

1350
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Jonathan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the Heterodox Academy.</v>

1351
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

1352
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.500
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something you've put into </v>

1353
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 4>practice that was designed to increase </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint diversity.</v>

1354
01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your sense of that?</v>

1355
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.630
<v Speaker 4>What's the consequence of that?</v>

1356
01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the problem is,</v>

1357
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we say in the book,</v>

1358
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.460
<v Speaker 3>there's six different separate </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributing factors all coming </v>

1359
01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The solution is not easy.</v>

1360
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's break it down into what do we need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do to get our universities </v>

1361
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 3>functioning better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we need to do to raise kids who </v>

1362
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 3>are more resilient and more able to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with difference?</v>

1363
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Let's focus on those two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's.</v>

1364
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So let's start with universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1365
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cofounded Heterodox Academy,</v>

1366
01:12:13.711 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Heterodoxacademy.org</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Nick Rosenkranz,</v>

1367
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>last caller and Chris Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Grad student in sociology and then a </v>

1368
01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.230
<v Speaker 3>bunch of other social psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1369
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.760
<v Speaker 3>because we were concerned that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a faculty initiative that </v>

1370
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.870
<v Speaker 3>discussions among professors of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology and research and psychology </v>

1371
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 3>was showing signs that certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypotheses wouldn't be investigated.</v>

1372
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Other interpretations were favored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were seeing signs and almost all of </v>

1373
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:41.090
<v Speaker 3>us were on the left or center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1374
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 3>there's only two conservative social </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist that I know of.</v>

1375
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.210
<v Speaker 3>We were concerned about research </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

1376
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 3>That's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we ended up putting up this site,</v>

1377
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 3>went live on or about September 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015.</v>

1378
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Totally unrelated to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg and I had been writing the Atlantic</v>

1379
01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:02.841
<v Speaker 3>article totally separate track and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>all hell broke loose at Halloween in </v>

1380
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 3>2015 and it became clear this isn't just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a faculty issue.</v>

1381
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>The problem on campus is a culture issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which in which student,</v>

1382
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 3>this new form of student activism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new form of student,</v>

1383
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 3>that belief in fragility is affecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we do our research,</v>

1384
01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:23.210
<v Speaker 3>how we educate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all problems are interrelated a bit </v>

1385
01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 3>to focus on the faculty issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're doing in Heterodox Academy.</v>

1386
01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Provisionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was running it,</v>

1387
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I thought the issue was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1388
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 3>we have no political diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to get more.</v>

1389
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:35.421
<v Speaker 3>We need to encourage more conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Libertarians to get phd's and then </v>

1390
01:13:35.421 --> 01:13:35.790
<v Speaker 3>we need to help them get jobs.</v>

1391
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:40.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought originally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over time the problem has morphed a </v>

1392
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:45.560
<v Speaker 3>and it's become clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do actually have some diversity in </v>

1393
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.110
<v Speaker 3>every field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody is on the left.</v>

1394
01:13:46.111 --> 01:13:50.250
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are in the center or </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian or they say,</v>

1395
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I can't be putting a box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what we have to do is encourage </v>

1396
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 3>those people to feel that they can speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1397
01:13:56.251 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 3>they can question dominant ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can be a little subversive.</v>

1398
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to make it so they're not </v>

1399
01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:05.060
<v Speaker 3>afraid of social consequences for </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking of.</v>

1400
01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's the way that I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it now.</v>

1401
01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Janet,</v>

1402
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 3>last January,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I turned over a heterodox academy.</v>

1403
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I hired an amazing woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deborah.</v>

1404
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 3>She's a professor at Harvey Mudd </v>
<v Speaker 3>College.</v>

1405
01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:18.811
<v Speaker 3>She is leaving that job to run heterodox</v>
<v Speaker 3>academy full time deb studies </v>

1406
01:14:18.911 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a great teacher.</v>

1407
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 3>She is moving the organization to focus </v>
<v Speaker 3>more on helping,</v>

1408
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 3>helping campuses recreate that climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we all know and love.</v>

1409
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1410
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.630
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love being a professor.</v>

1411
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:36.631
<v Speaker 3>I love universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm deb is focusing on how do we prepare</v>

1412
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:41.830
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we've talked a lot about this in </v>

1413
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.830
<v Speaker 3>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do at orientation?</v>

1414
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 3>What are the norms you made clear about </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and free speech.</v>

1415
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Of course we need to do training in </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity and inclusion and sexual </v>

1416
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.120
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>

1417
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 3>but how many schools trained for free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech?</v>

1418
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the fact that we don't mention any </v>

1419
01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.741
<v Speaker 3>of these deep philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major concepts that will be deep </v>

1420
01:14:58.741 --> 01:15:00.100
<v Speaker 3>philosophical underpinnings of academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

1421
01:15:00.101 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's just so much we can complain</v>

1422
01:15:02.591 --> 01:15:04.900
<v Speaker 3>about students not knowing them when </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's actually thought.</v>

1423
01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1424
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 4>it's been really interesting on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lecture tour and find out how receptive </v>

1425
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 4>people are to exactly that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>message,</v>

1426
01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:15.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been beating the drum,</v>

1427
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:20.221
<v Speaker 4>let's say four or more conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the relationship </v>

1428
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:24.130
<v Speaker 4>between meaning and personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility because one of the things</v>

1429
01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 4>we also teach students is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1430
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.400
<v Speaker 4>the proper focus for them is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>violation of their intrinsic rights as </v>

1431
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:37.651
<v Speaker 4>if the upholding of those rights is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to provide them with a sustaining </v>

1432
01:15:37.651 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 4>meaning in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't believe that that's true.</v>

1433
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:44.311
<v Speaker 4>I think that what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's more true is that most people </v>

1434
01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:48.091
<v Speaker 4>find a sustaining meaning by adopting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly heavy burden of personal </v>

1435
01:15:48.091 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 4>responsibility partly for themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly for their family.</v>

1436
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:52.830
<v Speaker 4>And partly for the broader community and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1437
01:15:52.831 --> 01:15:57.831
<v Speaker 4>that that just seems to have dropped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the public discourse in its entirety </v>

1438
01:15:57.831 --> 01:16:02.611
<v Speaker 4>and then also what could be taught to </v>
<v Speaker 4>incoming students is this clinical </v>

1439
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 4>doctrine that we've been describing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is well,</v>

1440
01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:10.501
<v Speaker 4>how do you make yourself stronger while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you expose yourself voluntarily to </v>

1441
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:16.470
<v Speaker 4>challenges that are outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain of current competence and that </v>

1442
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>often involves confronting things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that you think are frightening,</v>

1443
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:24.121
<v Speaker 4>but you might also think are disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what happens with </v>

1444
01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 4>obsessive compulsive disorder treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1445
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:29.701
<v Speaker 4>and discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously runs a motivates some of this </v>

1446
01:16:29.701 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 4>political polarization.</v>

1447
01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.850
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody alerted me,</v>

1448
01:16:32.851 --> 01:16:37.110
<v Speaker 3>somebody as civil rights scholar told me</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how the marchers in the sixties,</v>

1449
01:16:37.111 --> 01:16:42.111
<v Speaker 3>how they trained and here they are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to a staging,</v>

1450
01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:45.810
<v Speaker 3>protests going in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing sit ins facing real violence,</v>

1451
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:50.811
<v Speaker 3>and some of them were actually killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they prepared for it was others </v>

1452
01:16:50.811 --> 01:16:53.160
<v Speaker 3>would shout racist slurs at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will be prepared for it.</v>

1453
01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:56.340
<v Speaker 3>They would expose themselves to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst and then when the worst happens,</v>

1454
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:59.010
<v Speaker 3>at least it was less painful than had </v>
<v Speaker 3>they not encountered it.</v>

1455
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.420
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again,</v>

1456
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.670
<v Speaker 3>we see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

1457
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.580
<v Speaker 3>is your goal to toughen yourself up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is your goal to become stronger and more</v>

1458
01:17:05.581 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>able to deal with the world as it is or </v>
<v Speaker 3>is your goal to demand</v>

1459
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.700
<v Speaker 2>that somebody make the world other than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1460
01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.250
<v Speaker 2>which is the which is the more reliable </v>
<v Speaker 2>path to success in life.</v>

1461
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm in both John and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm president of fire and through </v>

1462
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Heterodox we're both trying to also </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out ways to get to people well </v>

1463
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.640
<v Speaker 2>before they set foot on a college </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus.</v>

1464
01:17:28.641 --> 01:17:33.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly I think it's kind of </v>

1465
01:17:33.641 --> 01:17:34.811
<v Speaker 2>unforgivable that most universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't teach about some of these </v>

1466
01:17:34.811 --> 01:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>philosophies and concepts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>

1467
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>but you should be learning about some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas when,</v>

1468
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.700
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in high school.</v>

1469
01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.900
<v Speaker 2>So one thing that John did that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally jealous of is they did a graphic</v>

1470
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:49.901
<v Speaker 2>novel version of a part of chapter two </v>
<v Speaker 2>of on liberty about freedom of speech as</v>

1471
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:54.030
<v Speaker 2>a great way to tell a generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>students about.</v>

1472
01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:57.690
<v Speaker 2>And I also just love on liberty </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictably argument,</v>

1473
01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:02.770
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech as a lawyer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this guy because this guy </v>

1474
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.860
<v Speaker 2>argued being able to defend the decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend blasts one meal to go up </v>

1475
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.040
<v Speaker 2>against blasphemy prohibitions at 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>59,</v>

1476
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 2>but then managed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1477
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:12.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1478
01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:17.650
<v Speaker 2>who suffered under blasphemy laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and socrates guess enforced them.</v>

1479
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Marcus Aurelius also one of your heroes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like you just won the case.</v>

1480
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:30.020
<v Speaker 2>You're a world class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me suggest that viewers go to </v>

1481
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:34.451
<v Speaker 2>Amazon and look up all minus one a or go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to heterodoxacademy.org/mill.</v>

1482
01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.240
<v Speaker 2>We can get a free version of pdf or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have a $3 kindle version of it as </v>

1483
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 2>well as the printed Arco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1484
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Put that in the description as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1485
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so high school,</v>

1486
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 2>any high school that wants to teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>about free speech and sign this,</v>

1487
01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:53.030
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely readable by high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

1488
01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just chapter two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut by 50 percent.</v>

1489
01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.280
<v Speaker 2>And metaphors are illustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1491
01:18:59.881 --> 01:19:04.881
<v Speaker 4>so the free speech issue too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the concepts that I've been </v>

1492
01:19:07.061 --> 01:19:12.061
<v Speaker 4>wrestling with is we have to produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies in order to accomplish tasks</v>

1493
01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:17.460
<v Speaker 4>collectively and we have to accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 4>tasks because they're suffering to </v>

1494
01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.331
<v Speaker 4>address real problems to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to produce hierarchies </v>

1495
01:19:21.331 --> 01:19:25.291
<v Speaker 4>and hopefully the hierarchies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on merit in relationship to </v>

1496
01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:30.061
<v Speaker 4>the solution of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the right winger types are more </v>

1497
01:19:30.061 --> 01:19:34.800
<v Speaker 4>inclined to support hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures because of their </v>

1498
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.981
<v Speaker 4>psychological predisposition and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>left wingers are more likely to be </v>

1499
01:19:38.651 --> 01:19:43.651
<v Speaker 4>concerned about the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy's inevitably dispossessed </v>

1500
01:19:43.651 --> 01:19:45.340
<v Speaker 4>because they'll produce on equal </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution of resources.</v>

1501
01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you can imagine that the </v>

1502
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:52.291
<v Speaker 4>political landscape is a battleground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are permanent battleground between those</v>

1503
01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:58.291
<v Speaker 4>who stand for the hierarchies and note </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they have their utility but are </v>

1504
01:19:58.291 --> 01:20:00.940
<v Speaker 4>perhaps blind to their proclivity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>become tyrannical.</v>

1505
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:06.300
<v Speaker 4>And those who are more sensitive to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>claims of the dispossessed and worried </v>

1506
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 4>about the proclivity of tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hierarchies to become,</v>

1507
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on nothing but power.</v>

1508
01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 4>At some points the hierarchy is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be weak and need to be strengthened.</v>

1509
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.200
<v Speaker 4>And the other points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there has to be more clamor on the side </v>

1510
01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 4>of the dispossessed and the reason you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have free speech as far as I'm concerned</v>

1511
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:31.320
<v Speaker 4>is because it's the mechanism that keeps</v>
<v Speaker 4>those two to opponent process,</v>

1512
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:37.160
<v Speaker 4>opponent process processes balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a core,</v>

1513
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>it's the core element of a free society </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's actually the process by </v>

1514
01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:45.070
<v Speaker 4>which the society maintains and improves</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself across time.</v>

1515
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.670
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just another value among </v>
<v Speaker 4>many values</v>

1516
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.140
<v Speaker 2>is one of the founding fathers were </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good evolutionary psychologists.</v>

1517
01:21:00.381 --> 01:21:05.381
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one thing that I love about working </v>

1518
01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 2>in constitutional law is just how both </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic and optimistic it was at the</v>

1519
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:12.741
<v Speaker 2>same time were the tensions of Alexander</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton and Madison were so concerned </v>

1520
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:15.500
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1521
01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 2>how do you balance out these natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

1522
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.800
<v Speaker 2>it's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas today,</v>

1523
01:21:19.801 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to claim the reason.</v>

1524
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.950
<v Speaker 2>There isn't any such thing as human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature on.</v>

1525
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.700
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is I have a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different philosophy on,</v>

1526
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.640
<v Speaker 2>on freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually much simpler than a lot of</v>

1527
01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:32.250
<v Speaker 2>sort of like the more sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>platonic,</v>

1528
01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 2>platonic ideal of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is simply that it's always </v>

1529
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:39.720
<v Speaker 2>valuable to know what people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>think as simple as that sounds.</v>

1530
01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:41.250
<v Speaker 2>It does mean that when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1531
01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:46.251
<v Speaker 2>you certainly certainly you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to conspiracy theorists and </v>

1532
01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:46.251
<v Speaker 2>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they say about stuff.</v>

1533
01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:48.300
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a popular conspiracies,</v>

1534
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:53.330
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you have some clue about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the population actually thinks </v>

1535
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:54.640
<v Speaker 2>about things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we,</v>

1536
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:55.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1537
01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:01.440
<v Speaker 2>that understanding what people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>despise actually think and believe is </v>

1538
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.950
<v Speaker 2>always a value because the project </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is a project of human knowledge.</v>

1539
01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.520
<v Speaker 2>No one human beings as they actually are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as we wish they were.</v>

1540
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:14.150
<v Speaker 4>I can use that terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if I want to know what you're </v>

1541
01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:19.811
<v Speaker 4>going to do and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if I happen to be near you </v>

1542
01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.500
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or have you or have to interact with you</v>

1543
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:26.501
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I know what you think and I can </v>

1544
01:22:26.501 --> 01:22:28.670
<v Speaker 4>understand how you're going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if I don't know how you,</v>

1545
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.880
<v Speaker 4>how you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly because you're not allowed to </v>

1546
01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.401
<v Speaker 4>express it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're an opaque mystery to me and </v>

1547
01:22:36.401 --> 01:22:38.120
<v Speaker 4>the probability that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>engage in conflict goes up tremendously.</v>

1548
01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.750
<v Speaker 4>So I mean there are multiple reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the,</v>

1549
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.680
<v Speaker 4>for protecting the sanctity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say a free speech.</v>

1550
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that really distresses</v>

1551
01:22:48.621 --> 01:22:53.621
<v Speaker 4>me about the postmodern slash neo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist philosophy is that there isn't </v>

1552
01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:58.340
<v Speaker 4>any room in that philosophy for the idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of free speech.</v>

1553
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Know this is something I've come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand more deeply over the last two</v>

1554
01:23:02.331 --> 01:23:02.630
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1555
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 4>When you're talking to someone from that</v>
<v Speaker 4>theoretical.</v>

1556
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:11.260
<v Speaker 4>They can't engage in the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>about free speech because it doesn't fit</v>

1557
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 4>into their worldview because all there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1558
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:19.590
<v Speaker 4>There isn't sovereign individuals </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaging in a discussion about the </v>

1559
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:22.951
<v Speaker 4>nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's avatars of their power group </v>

1560
01:23:22.951 --> 01:23:26.820
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously making claims on behalf of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their privilege and that there's never </v>

1561
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.050
<v Speaker 4>free speech there because you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>a free agent.</v>

1562
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 4>You're not even a real entity as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

1563
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:32.870
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1564
01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:38.020
<v Speaker 4>and that's a far more pernicious assault</v>
<v Speaker 4>on free speech than mere objection to </v>

1565
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:38.540
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

1566
01:23:38.541 --> 01:23:43.541
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a right wing as something that's been </v>

1567
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:44.720
<v Speaker 4>hijacked by the right wing to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to validate their power,</v>

1568
01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 4>their particular privilege,</v>

1569
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.030
<v Speaker 2>because this is one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that we get back,</v>

1570
01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>is a free speech is just a way for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful to retain their power.</v>

1571
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Greg's cause when the Nazis started </v>
<v Speaker 2>having rallies for free speech.</v>

1572
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's really not what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your response when people say </v>

1573
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>free speech is just to help some </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1574
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:13.490
<v Speaker 2>It drives me nuts because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental misunderstanding of history </v>

1575
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and government and political philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

1576
01:24:15.031 --> 01:24:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I've had this argument with Stanley fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seemed like a total shock to him.</v>

1577
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it'd be thought of it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need a special protection </v>

1578
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.320
<v Speaker 2>of an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1579
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1580
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:31.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1581
01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:33.340
<v Speaker 2>for the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1582
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.360
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich people and powerful people under </v>

1583
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.990
<v Speaker 2>any system of government where rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's under communism,</v>

1584
01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:41.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do so well.</v>

1585
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they take over,</v>

1586
01:24:42.691 --> 01:24:43.820
<v Speaker 2>but after they take over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1587
01:24:43.821 --> 01:24:46.980
<v Speaker 2>like the KGB people get rich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1588
01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:50.760
<v Speaker 2>People are always going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you set up a democracy,</v>

1589
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority is always,</v>

1590
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:55.920
<v Speaker 2>if there's a consistent majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority is always going to be fine.</v>

1591
01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You only need a special protection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech for minority points of</v>

1592
01:25:00.211 --> 01:25:00.480
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

1593
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1594
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.990
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely amazing that that's not.</v>

1595
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:08.490
<v Speaker 2>And John Roche and it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1596
01:25:09.450 --> 01:25:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Refresh has a lot of interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says it's like,</v>

1597
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:18.590
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've reached the point where </v>

1598
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.590
<v Speaker 2>there's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1599
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:19.680
<v Speaker 2>enough people who are worried about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing,</v>

1600
01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:24.060
<v Speaker 2>that they're willing to pass a law and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority country to get you protected.</v>

1601
01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It probably means the real dark days are</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>

1602
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that we've talked </v>

1603
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 2>about me and Roche is that if we passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>an anti,</v>

1604
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.650
<v Speaker 2>sort of a hate speech law saying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>late 19 sixties,</v>

1605
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:38.130
<v Speaker 2>it would have frozen in place kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitudes about homosexuality,</v>

1606
01:25:38.131 --> 01:25:43.131
<v Speaker 2>which he was concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we would have ended up with </v>

1607
01:25:43.131 --> 01:25:47.151
<v Speaker 2>a law that looked a lot more like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see in Russia that actually ends up </v>

1608
01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:50.001
<v Speaker 2>being used against a gay people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>then then rather these sort of </v>

1609
01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:51.120
<v Speaker 2>progressive law that we hope it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1610
01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.110
<v Speaker 2>But time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you like,</v>

1611
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:55.840
<v Speaker 2>by the way I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep on trying to put this out to from</v>

1612
01:25:55.850 --> 01:26:00.270
<v Speaker 2>a very practical way like so you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws that define that,</v>

1613
01:26:00.271 --> 01:26:03.290
<v Speaker 2>that allow the government to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful speech and you want trump</v>

1614
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 3>and some.</v>

1615
01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:11.710
<v Speaker 4>There's an old military doctrine which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is whatever weapon you design your </v>

1616
01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:16.601
<v Speaker 4>enemies will have in 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you start putting restrictions on</v>

1617
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:22.241
<v Speaker 4>something like free speech as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a benefit to your ideological </v>

1618
01:26:22.241 --> 01:26:26.891
<v Speaker 4>position and you don't imagine that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be out maneuvered in their use by </v>

1619
01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 4>your enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're not sufficiently awake.</v>

1620
01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 4>So when I did a lecture a year and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>half ago,</v>

1621
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 4>which was a left wing case for free </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>

1622
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:38.990
<v Speaker 4>and I just thought that was self evident</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the reasons that you put forward,</v>

1623
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:43.991
<v Speaker 4>which is well the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can use leftwing terminology </v>

1624
01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:48.011
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the powerful have an a priori monopoly </v>

1625
01:26:48.011 --> 01:26:52.541
<v Speaker 4>on speech obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you want to put protections in </v>

1626
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:56.471
<v Speaker 4>place so that the dispossessed who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically champion get a chance to </v>

1627
01:26:56.471 --> 01:26:58.430
<v Speaker 4>put their viewpoint forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's really,</v>

1628
01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:03.670
<v Speaker 4>it's quite a mystery that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's not merely axiomatically </v>

1629
01:27:03.670 --> 01:27:06.420
<v Speaker 4>obvious now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1631
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:12.101
<v Speaker 3>it's not Caesar calling for free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the easy thing to do is say,</v>

1632
01:27:12.361 --> 01:27:13.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then it must be bad.</v>

1633
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1634
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1635
01:27:16.471 --> 01:27:18.300
<v Speaker 4>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go back to the book.</v>

1636
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:24.580
<v Speaker 4>So how you said earlier when we talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>before the interview that it had,</v>

1637
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the New York Times bestseller list </v>

1638
01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:31.860
<v Speaker 4>and it seems to be selling well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you hoping,</v>

1639
01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 4>what do you see happening as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of your essay in the </v>

1640
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.301
<v Speaker 4>Atlantic and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as a consequence of the book and </v>

1641
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 4>what you hope will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say over the next year if we're </v>

1642
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:44.730
<v Speaker 4>going to be optimistic about where we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>headed,</v>

1643
01:27:44.731 --> 01:27:45.550
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen?</v>

1644
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:51.470
<v Speaker 3>So I felt for the last two years that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of in an emperor's new </v>

1645
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>clothes situation where most people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are paying attention,</v>

1646
01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:59.460
<v Speaker 3>most people are involved in universities</v>
<v Speaker 3>or an education realized that something </v>

1647
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.610
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't understand what it is and</v>

1648
01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:05.611
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to appear insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people don't want to stand up and </v>

1649
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 3>critique if it seems that you're pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>back against it,</v>

1650
01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.770
<v Speaker 3>against the historical marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups in particular.</v>

1651
01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:12.250
<v Speaker 3>So there's been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So university administrators,</v>

1652
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:14.770
<v Speaker 3>we spoke to a lot of college presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're overwhelmingly,</v>

1653
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:16.660
<v Speaker 3>what I would call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal left,</v>

1654
01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:21.690
<v Speaker 3>not illiberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know of any college presidents </v>

1655
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:22.240
<v Speaker 3>who are illiberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're often afraid to stand up for</v>

1656
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.890
<v Speaker 3>what you've observed you to Evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 3>State University.</v>

1657
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1658
01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1659
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1660
01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.200
<v Speaker 3>So there's been a lot of desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

1661
01:28:34.201 --> 01:28:38.250
<v Speaker 3>a lot of desire to restore some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordering community on campus that we can</v>

1662
01:28:38.251 --> 01:28:40.440
<v Speaker 3>do our work and our teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1663
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1664
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.360
<v Speaker 3>but I'm hopeful that our book will do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is give everyone a common set of </v>

1665
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.351
<v Speaker 3>concepts and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of a look into how this thing </v>

1666
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:54.621
<v Speaker 3>plays out if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't do anything to stop it </v>

1667
01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:54.621
<v Speaker 3>going down this rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1668
01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:58.520
<v Speaker 3>my hope for the book is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting stuff is,</v>

1669
01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:01.440
<v Speaker 3>is new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a lot of people have been what's</v>

1670
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:06.441
<v Speaker 3>going on on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't realize this is now </v>

1671
01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.350
<v Speaker 3>happening in high schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my hope is that every,</v>

1672
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:12.710
<v Speaker 3>every school principal from elementary </v>
<v Speaker 3>school through high school and every </v>

1673
01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:16.101
<v Speaker 3>college president will get a copy of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>book in the mail or given to them by a </v>

1674
01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 3>donor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

1675
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Jordan's large audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that you will buy a copy of the </v>

1676
01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:26.961
<v Speaker 3>book and give it to the principal of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids' elementary school and </v>

1677
01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:26.961
<v Speaker 3>certainly</v>

1678
01:29:27.710 --> 01:29:30.290
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can put that in the description</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

1679
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Makes a great gift to the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>educating your children.</v>

1680
01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1681
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 4>I'll write that down right now.</v>

1682
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Reaching parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's always the first constituency </v>

1683
01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:42.710
<v Speaker 3>we talk about because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1684
01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 3>we hear it from parents over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again as parents ourselves.</v>

1685
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:51.050
<v Speaker 3>There's this kind of like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that something's really going </v>

1686
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:55.461
<v Speaker 3>wrong in k through 12 education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainty there's something more going </v>

1687
01:29:55.461 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 3>on than just the process of parenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>where most people feel kind of.</v>

1688
01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.830
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a lot of parents feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of helpless because they don't have</v>

1689
01:30:01.831 --> 01:30:06.831
<v Speaker 3>that pluralistic ignorance problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know that everybody else </v>

1690
01:30:06.831 --> 01:30:10.790
<v Speaker 3>having the same problems and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually get the conversation </v>

1691
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.790
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can get to parents,</v>

1692
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1693
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:12.330
<v Speaker 3>we have a real fighting chance.</v>

1694
01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

1695
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1696
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.480
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

1697
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Are you optimistic or pessimistic about </v>
<v Speaker 4>where this is going at the moment?</v>

1698
01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.880
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly.</v>

1699
01:30:25.881 --> 01:30:30.881
<v Speaker 3>You hit a little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very pessimistic about the national </v>

1700
01:30:30.881 --> 01:30:34.891
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think polarization is going to get </v>

1701
01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:36.811
<v Speaker 3>worse for awhile while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think we have to think about </v>

1702
01:30:36.811 --> 01:30:39.400
<v Speaker 3>how do we adapt our institutions to life</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an increasingly polarized country.</v>

1703
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.800
<v Speaker 3>So if know politics is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is dominating everything and it's </v>

1704
01:30:45.281 --> 01:30:50.281
<v Speaker 3>getting nastier and Nastier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be great if when you go into a </v>

1705
01:30:50.281 --> 01:30:50.281
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to think about,</v>

1706
01:30:50.281 --> 01:30:54.140
<v Speaker 3>is this a Democrat restaurant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go into buy a pair of sneakers,</v>

1707
01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:56.270
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this a democratic pair of sneakers,</v>

1708
01:30:56.271 --> 01:31:01.271
<v Speaker 3>a Republican pair of sneakers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we maybe go into the rope to </v>

1709
01:31:01.271 --> 01:31:01.271
<v Speaker 3>everything is polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's political.</v>

1710
01:31:01.271 --> 01:31:03.830
<v Speaker 3>That'd be terrible if universities to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to that,</v>

1711
01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:07.000
<v Speaker 3>if this is a Democrat university or </v>
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>

1712
01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.670
<v Speaker 3>that would be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1713
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.160
<v Speaker 3>so I think on the national level I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>very pessimistic,</v>

1714
01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there is enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition that we're all exhausted.</v>

1715
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:18.270
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is out of control,</v>

1716
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.480
<v Speaker 3>but I think we will have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be possible to get a constituency </v>

1717
01:31:23.701 --> 01:31:26.820
<v Speaker 3>to say our elementary schools or middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools or high schools.</v>

1718
01:31:26.821 --> 01:31:28.710
<v Speaker 3>And universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have work to do,</v>

1719
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1720
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 3>we need to reform what we're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that are better for the kids.</v>

1721
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:35.040
<v Speaker 3>We all love our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all want our kids to be resilient.</v>

1722
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>So I like Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very optimistic that,</v>

1723
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 3>that the trend towards overprotective </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting,</v>

1724
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:42.590
<v Speaker 3>which has just been continuing on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1725
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm very optimistic that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will reverse once people see those </v>

1726
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 3>graphs once people and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents of teenagers,</v>

1727
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:52.560
<v Speaker 3>even if their kid isn't depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven of their kids' friends,</v>

1728
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:54.030
<v Speaker 3>depressed or anxious.</v>

1729
01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me ask you about that a little </v>

1730
01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:00.960
<v Speaker 4>bit and maybe we'll end with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1731
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to figure out why this </v>
<v Speaker 4>overprotectiveness epidemic has emerged.</v>

1732
01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:11.941
<v Speaker 4>And so I took the social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological root of analysis instead </v>

1733
01:32:11.941 --> 01:32:16.351
<v Speaker 4>of the psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I do know you should look at </v>

1734
01:32:16.351 --> 01:32:18.961
<v Speaker 4>situational factors before you look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>app in personality factors.</v>

1735
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Let's say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1736
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:24.310
<v Speaker 4>here's some demographic trends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1737
01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:30.330
<v Speaker 4>fewer kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe parents don't make their kids </v>

1738
01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:31.830
<v Speaker 4>resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe siblings do,</v>

1739
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of,</v>

1740
01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.100
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1741
01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.580
<v Speaker 4>what would you call status competition </v>
<v Speaker 4>between siblings and if you're special </v>

1742
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:47.490
<v Speaker 4>or unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] your siblings are going to </v>

1743
01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 4>have a field day with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1744
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:53.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can't raise kids that are </v>

1745
01:32:53.130 --> 01:32:55.231
<v Speaker 4>resilient unless they have three </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters or something like </v>

1746
01:32:55.231 --> 01:32:55.231
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1747
01:32:55.231 --> 01:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>That makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my recollection was elicits a cela </v>

1748
01:32:59.210 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who wrote birth order,</v>

1749
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 3>what was that book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My recollection is that the effects of </v>

1750
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:09.940
<v Speaker 3>birth out are actually very small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so whether you're a first or last,</v>

1751
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 3>whether you're an only child or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So research one back very far,</v>

1752
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:17.761
<v Speaker 3>those effects are pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would not put this big change on </v>

1753
01:33:17.761 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 3>the factor of declining families because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have siblings rather declining</v>

1754
01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:23.500
<v Speaker 3>families means there just aren't that </v>
<v Speaker 3>many kids in the neighborhood.</v>

1755
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the other issue.</v>

1756
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

1757
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because more significant.</v>

1758
01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:34.630
<v Speaker 4>So then next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>next thing might be older parents know </v>

1759
01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:41.220
<v Speaker 4>we don't know how optimally stupid you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be when you're a,</v>

1760
01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:46.490
<v Speaker 4>when you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it might be that you might need to </v>

1761
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.251
<v Speaker 4>be somewhat narcissistically entranced </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your own life to ignore your </v>

1762
01:33:49.251 --> 01:33:52.740
<v Speaker 4>children enough to allow them to develop</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent resilience,</v>

1763
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're,</v>

1764
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:56.520
<v Speaker 4>if now let's say you don't have a child </v>
<v Speaker 4>until you're,</v>

1765
01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:59.640
<v Speaker 4>well let's say 40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you only have one or two,</v>

1766
01:33:59.641 --> 01:34:04.641
<v Speaker 4>so they're pretty damn precious and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd been waiting a long time and now </v>

1767
01:34:04.641 --> 01:34:08.301
<v Speaker 4>you're more conservative because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>older because you will be and you have </v>

1768
01:34:08.301 --> 01:34:12.210
<v Speaker 4>endless resources to devote to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily valuable individual.</v>

1769
01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if it,</v>

1770
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:18.450
<v Speaker 4>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's the consequence of it switch and</v>

1771
01:34:18.451 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 4>demographics and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1772
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 4>and older parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's going to be a harder thing to </v>

1773
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.950
<v Speaker 4>rectify as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation of attitude.</v>

1774
01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas is major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major theory on this stuff.</v>

1775
01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.100
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1776
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to say some things that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>have changed.</v>

1777
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:42.160
<v Speaker 3>And definitely what first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a first generation American.</v>

1778
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1779
01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.240
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that there's this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1780
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:53.580
<v Speaker 3>of the stratification in the US in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of income is getting so dramatic and the</v>

1781
01:34:53.581 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 3>way you can get to that life raft is </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into a princeton or Stanford</v>

1782
01:34:58.350 --> 01:35:00.030
<v Speaker 2>or Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1783
01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.270
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not entirely in people's heads,</v>

1784
01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately the way we thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1785
01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:09.640
<v Speaker 2>the best way to do that is to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sort of rocket ship hyper invested</v>

1786
01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:14.650
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have two kids and you treat them </v>

1787
01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:16.661
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like keep seeking missiles and you </v>

1788
01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 2>completely eliminate any autonomy over </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

1789
01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:19.700
<v Speaker 2>They get up at six and they're scheduled</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they go to bed.</v>

1790
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that this is visibly </v>

1791
01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:25.080
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

1792
01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:29.771
<v Speaker 2>it's why we interviewed Julie Haines who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called how to raise an </v>

1793
01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:29.771
<v Speaker 2>adult about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1794
01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.920
<v Speaker 2>freshmen are showing up at Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm depressed partially because they </v>

1795
01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.590
<v Speaker 2>have been no sense of locus of control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their life.</v>

1796
01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:42.420
<v Speaker 2>So I think there is a really stunning </v>
<v Speaker 2>success that we found in researching the</v>

1797
01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:47.501
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no surprise that meant if you </v>

1798
01:35:47.501 --> 01:35:49.781
<v Speaker 2>compare it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to the 19 fifties and </v>

1799
01:35:49.781 --> 01:35:51.791
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how men spend their time and </v>

1800
01:35:51.791 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 2>today it's no surprise that men are </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending more time in childcare and more</v>

1801
01:35:53.931 --> 01:35:54.680
<v Speaker 2>time with their kids.</v>

1802
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all think that's great.</v>

1803
01:35:56.750 --> 01:36:01.750
<v Speaker 2>What do you think has happened to women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women were very rarely working in the </v>

1804
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:05.381
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties and so look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of hours they spent two and </v>

1805
01:36:05.381 --> 01:36:07.871
<v Speaker 2>childcare involve their children back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then getting us going up or down since </v>

1806
01:36:07.871 --> 01:36:08.810
<v Speaker 2>the fifties or sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they most women are working.</v>

1807
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Answer one more time with their kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are very few kids now.</v>

1808
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have mom and dad both spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>more time with their one or two kids </v>

1809
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:24.270
<v Speaker 2>supervising over investing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not a lot of kids out in the </v>

1810
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and investing poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's important is right there.</v>

1811
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're investing in a what?</v>

1812
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:30.140
<v Speaker 2>A net zero calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Concerted cultivation.</v>

1813
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 2>We have the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two.</v>

1814
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:34.360
<v Speaker 4>Here's another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another conundrum.</v>

1815
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:40.830
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that struck me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of this gender play that you </v>

1816
01:36:40.871 --> 01:36:45.871
<v Speaker 4>see gender roleplay that you see in </v>
<v Speaker 4>among adolescents now,</v>

1817
01:36:45.911 --> 01:36:48.280
<v Speaker 4>older adolescents and young adults in </v>
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

1818
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:53.281
<v Speaker 4>So the gender bender and gender fluidity</v>
<v Speaker 4>a games and I'm calling them games for a</v>

1819
01:36:54.641 --> 01:36:59.641
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They remind me of pretend play within </v>

1820
01:36:59.641 --> 01:37:01.480
<v Speaker 4>insistence by the player that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>joins the game.</v>

1821
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:06.510
<v Speaker 4>And I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe we're seeing a delayed </v>

1822
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:10.150
<v Speaker 4>reaction to the eradication of fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 4>play in early childhood as a consequence</v>

1823
01:37:10.151 --> 01:37:12.370
<v Speaker 4>of the introduction of technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>devices.</v>

1824
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the developmental psychologists know </v>

1825
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:19.480
<v Speaker 4>very well that children have to engage </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of fantasy play.</v>

1826
01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:25.050
<v Speaker 4>And then if you introduce technology </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that interferes with that or </v>

1827
01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 4>supersedes if then the fantasy play </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do occurred.</v>

1828
01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.300
<v Speaker 4>You're playing with different roles when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're engaged in fantasy play.</v>

1829
01:37:31.630 --> 01:37:33.280
<v Speaker 4>So I'm also wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1830
01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:36.610
<v Speaker 4>because I noticed even when I had kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is no for a long time ago,</v>

1831
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:40.990
<v Speaker 4>often when I took them to the houses of </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people with kids,</v>

1832
01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.440
<v Speaker 4>instead of letting the kids go off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>caused a bit of trouble and then settle </v>

1833
01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.840
<v Speaker 4>into a spontaneous fantasy play episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd put on a video,</v>

1834
01:37:51.370 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 4>but now that's like 20 times is bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>because all kids have access to endless </v>

1835
01:37:56.941 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 4>electronic devices and we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that's doing to the early childhood</v>

1836
01:38:00.421 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 4>play and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1837
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:08.691
<v Speaker 4>those are some of the sociological </v>
<v Speaker 4>forces that I thought might be at work </v>

1838
01:38:08.691 --> 01:38:12.170
<v Speaker 4>that are driving this hype of </v>
<v Speaker 4>protectiveness and if it isn't obvious </v>

1839
01:38:12.170 --> 01:38:15.351
<v Speaker 4>to see how to reverse them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not happening consciously in </v>

1840
01:38:15.421 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 4>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1841
01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:21.291
<v Speaker 4>It's not like everybody decided that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to hyper protect their </v>

1842
01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:21.291
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1843
01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think social norms are very </v>

1844
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.221
<v Speaker 3>powerful and if everybody else acts like</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting your kid walk a dog is </v>

1845
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:33.891
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be less likely to let your kid </v>

1846
01:38:33.891 --> 01:38:34.410
<v Speaker 3>walk the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be possible to reverse that.</v>

1847
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:37.220
<v Speaker 3>What we're hoping will emerge from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>book and our discussions,</v>

1848
01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 3>the book is the norm that if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>letting your kid out,</v>

1849
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.410
<v Speaker 3>you're harming your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a vitamin deficiency.</v>

1850
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know if doctor story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if pediatricians and the pediatricians </v>

1851
01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:53.181
<v Speaker 3>just put out a big report on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance of play at kids need a lot </v>

1852
01:38:53.181 --> 01:38:57.321
<v Speaker 3>more play than they're getting vitamin P</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how much vitamin P did your kid get </v>

1853
01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:59.910
<v Speaker 3>today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And parents and vitamin D is not.</v>

1854
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't count if you were there with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1855
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:05.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1856
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:10.610
<v Speaker 3>so if we start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if pediatricians aren't asking them how </v>

1857
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:11.580
<v Speaker 3>much vitamin peg kid get less and only </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me about the unsupervised time.</v>

1858
01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:16.370
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we look at the idea because you know,</v>

1859
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:19.410
<v Speaker 3>so your point about the shrinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>families is,</v>

1860
01:39:19.411 --> 01:39:24.411
<v Speaker 3>is right and that's irreversible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're never going to go back to large </v>

1861
01:39:24.411 --> 01:39:24.411
<v Speaker 3>families.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to adapt to that.</v>

1862
01:39:24.411 --> 01:39:26.100
<v Speaker 3>And if you really want your kid to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>

1863
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:27.630
<v Speaker 3>he'll back off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

1864
01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 3>We have to get across.</v>

1865
01:39:30.490 --> 01:39:35.490
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kid's going to have to encounter </v>

1866
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:36.580
<v Speaker 4>the full tragedy of life as they mature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and become adults.</v>

1867
01:39:37.090 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to do what you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1868
01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:46.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are all sorts of things.</v>

1869
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.080
<v Speaker 3>So when Nisha said what doesn't kill you</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you stronger,</v>

1870
01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 3>the principle is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not literally true and the </v>

1871
01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:01.020
<v Speaker 3>research on adverse childhood </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences and we talk a fair amount </v>

1872
01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.960
<v Speaker 3>about advocating for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly for goodness sakes,</v>

1873
01:40:09.401 --> 01:40:14.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to get in fights with other </v>

1874
01:40:14.401 --> 01:40:17.281
<v Speaker 3>kids and resolved among themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got rid of that and now we have a </v>

1875
01:40:17.741 --> 01:40:19.450
<v Speaker 3>generation that's looking upwards.</v>

1876
01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Say whatever doesn't kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you stronger.</v>

1877
01:40:27.141 --> 01:40:30.670
<v Speaker 4>So he certainly knew that something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1878
01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's a matter of optimal exposure to </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenge and it's by challenging your </v>

1879
01:40:36.501 --> 01:40:41.501
<v Speaker 4>kid's not five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protecting them that you make them </v>

1880
01:40:41.501 --> 01:40:42.710
<v Speaker 4>resilient and they need to be resilient </v>
<v Speaker 4>because life is actually difficult.</v>

1881
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:44.350
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1882
01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.360
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's been gratifying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me too is during my lectures I've </v>

1883
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.460
<v Speaker 4>been telling people that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're okay the way they are,</v>

1884
01:40:52.461 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 4>especially if young is an appalling </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

1885
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:59.650
<v Speaker 4>What they could be concentrating on is </v>
<v Speaker 4>who they could be.</v>

1886
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:05.650
<v Speaker 4>One of the really positive elements to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the notion of optimal challenges,</v>

1887
01:41:05.651 --> 01:41:07.110
<v Speaker 4>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1888
01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:12.930
<v Speaker 4>it's encouraging for people to know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to let them take a risk </v>

1889
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:16.900
<v Speaker 4>because you have enough faith in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to learn and prevailed that,</v>

1890
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.790
<v Speaker 4>that supersedes the risk.</v>

1891
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.760
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well thank you guys very much </v>

1892
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.460
<v Speaker 4>appreciated the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get this up as soon as I get it </v>

1893
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:34.351
<v Speaker 4>edited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which shouldn't be too long and if you </v>

1894
01:41:34.351 --> 01:41:36.841
<v Speaker 4>would be so kind as to send me all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>url links you'd like me to post in the </v>

1895
01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:41.311
<v Speaker 4>description,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I would be more than happy to do </v>

1896
01:41:41.311 --> 01:41:44.341
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And good luck with your continued sales </v>

1897
01:41:44.341 --> 01:41:46.360
<v Speaker 4>of your book and with all your other </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavors as well.</v>

1898
01:41:46.361 --> 01:41:51.361
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully a good sense will prevail </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can do something to reverse this </v>

1899
01:41:52.781 --> 01:41:57.781
<v Speaker 4>polarization and to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also maybe to reduce the safety </v>

1900
01:41:58.031 --> 01:42:01.770
<v Speaker 4>culture on in the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would really be something.</v>

1901
01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan.</v>

1902
01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good to see you both.</v>
