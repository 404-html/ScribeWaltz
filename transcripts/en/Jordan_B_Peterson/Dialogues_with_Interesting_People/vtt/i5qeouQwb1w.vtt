1
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking today with Samuel Andrea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a composer or Canadian composer </v>

2
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>who's currently residing in Strausberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's working as a composer and </v>

3
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk today about music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think we'll start off by having </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam talk a little bit about his career </v>

5
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and position itself so that we can move </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

6
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>into the conversation and provide a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of context for everybody who's watching </v>

7
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take it away.</v>

8
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a composer.</v>

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Canada originally and I lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>there until I was 22 and I decided </v>

10
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 2>actually fairly early on that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in France.</v>

11
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I moved to Paris where I studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>for quite a number of years at the Paris</v>

12
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>conservatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I remained there for 12 years and moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Strasburg two and a half years ago </v>

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>and I've been here ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mainly a composer,</v>

15
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 2>but I do a lot of other things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a poet.</v>

16
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a performer.</v>

17
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences in,</v>

18
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>in North America first as a composer.</v>

19
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should start by saying that because I </v>

20
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.901
<v Speaker 2>left so young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really have the opportunity to </v>

21
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>put together anything resembling a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional career when I was living in</v>

22
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>but what I can say is that I started out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in music by,</v>

24
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 2>by producing songs when I was a teenager</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that became something of an </v>

25
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.971
<v Speaker 2>obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very interested in a sort of </v>

26
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:46.811
<v Speaker 2>unusual branch of the sort of singer </v>
<v Speaker 2>songwriter tradition that involved </v>

27
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to avalon guard </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of music and trying to </v>

28
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 2>incorporate those into the pop song </v>
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And there is a very fascinating and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lengthy history of that.</v>

30
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And so that was sort of my initial foray</v>
<v Speaker 2>into music.</v>

31
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So I made a total of about eight or nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>albums of,</v>

32
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of songs.</v>

33
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And as I was going along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became more and more interested in </v>

34
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>forms of musical expression that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>not easily compatible with the song </v>

35
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>

36
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 2>And that resulted in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting tension.</v>

37
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 2>And so towards the end of my sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>very short lived career as a,</v>

38
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 2>as a singer songwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became obvious to me that I couldn't,</v>

39
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't resolve the contradictions </v>
<v Speaker 2>between sort of popular forms of </v>

40
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.141
<v Speaker 2>expression and the sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really starting to fascinate me </v>

41
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>and just keep me up at night in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>format of the pop song.</v>

42
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 2>So that resulted in a kind of schism at </v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain point where I was making songs</v>

43
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 2>that really didn't sound like songs at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

44
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>And it was from that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

45
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 2>it was a fairly straightforward matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to abandon ship,</v>

46
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

47
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and basically,</v>

48
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take up a full time composition.</v>

49
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You said that you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate avant garde elements into </v>

50
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.071
<v Speaker 1>your songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think maybe the first thing you </v>

51
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:16.681
<v Speaker 1>could do is defined for the listeners </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the song and and </v>

52
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>other forms of composition because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not self evident to people standing </v>

53
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>outside the professional musical </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

54
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>And also what you mean by avant garde </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms and why you were trying to </v>

55
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>incorporate them.</v>

56
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Well essentially the song is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vernacular format,</v>

57
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:30.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

58
00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:35.801
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of expression that deals </v>
<v Speaker 2>with materials that are familiar to </v>

59
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody in that are accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

60
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard pop song has three chords </v>

61
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these are,</v>

62
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>these are very easy materials to </v>
<v Speaker 2>masters,</v>

63
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 2>so anyone you know who's interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough in it can,</v>

64
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.950
<v Speaker 2>can take the trouble to learn those </v>
<v Speaker 2>three chords and put together something </v>

65
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 2>resembling a pop song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not be very good at it,</v>

66
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.591
<v Speaker 2>but you can still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can access the basic fundamental </v>

67
00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>building blocks of the pop song fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

68
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas other branches of a composition </v>

69
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.810
<v Speaker 2>are primarily written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not primarily things that come </v>

70
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 2>out of a performance tradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily.</v>

71
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be initially encoded as a,</v>

72
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 2>as a score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then only after the score is </v>

73
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.661
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have hopefully a performance </v>

74
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 2>tradition coming out of the piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas an in pop music,</v>

75
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start with the instrument,</v>

76
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you start with performing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start with,</v>

77
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 2>with the sort of immediate to a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactile relationship.</v>

78
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:34.221
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your instrument and the music sort of </v>

79
00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:37.490
<v Speaker 2>flows out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't begin with the score with </v>

80
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.490
<v Speaker 2>the written document</v>

81
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.680
<v Speaker 1>and these avant garde elements that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about.</v>

82
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

83
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 1>what got you interested in them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you think it was useful?</v>

84
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:49.431
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and explain a bit more about what </v>

85
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:49.650
<v Speaker 1>happened when you started pursuing them.</v>

86
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility.</v>

87
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 2>It was something that had literally just</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed me by the throat because when </v>

88
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 2>one thing that started to happen was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties particularly,</v>

90
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:05.191
<v Speaker 2>you had this very brief cultural moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was a kind of crossover </v>

91
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:08.821
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between what the postwar avant garde </v>

92
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:12.091
<v Speaker 2>we're doing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sort of most broadly popular </v>

93
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>rock acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

94
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:18.211
<v Speaker 2>the Beatles on there on the white album </v>
<v Speaker 2>famously included the track called </v>

95
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>revolution nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a sound collage.</v>

96
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a piece of a sonic art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an absolutely no regard a rock </v>

97
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did that because the,</v>

98
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Lennon and Paul Mccartney,</v>

99
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>we're interested in Stockhausen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like this.</v>

100
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's an extraordinary cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and the Beatles were far from the</v>

101
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>only ones to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

102
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>if you get interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that kind of music from that year,</v>

103
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>from the sixties and onwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look at it closely,</v>

104
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't help noticing that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of shadow world that's,</v>

105
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>that's peeking through via these sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of manifestations and a lot of,</v>

106
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>a lot of groups did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did things like that as well.</v>

107
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 2>The doors did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did very,</v>

108
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange sort of collage,</v>

109
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>avant garde poetry and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>

110
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

111
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>that you can't easily square with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands of the pop song format.</v>

112
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So as I was listening to these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 12 or 13 years old,</v>

113
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.550
<v Speaker 2>my attention was instinctively drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more unusual elements of those </v>

114
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.760
<v Speaker 2>records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting because when they </v>

115
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.861
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were usually the tracks that </v>

116
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:23.861
<v Speaker 2>everybody skipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

117
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:23.861
<v Speaker 2>But not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I was instinctively fascinated by them.</v>

119
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that Jim Morrison's </v>
<v Speaker 1>foray outside of the song format was </v>

120
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>generally unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

121
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and I was confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

122
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:34.440
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to revolution number </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

123
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 1>although I thought that in the context </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that album,</v>

124
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it was very interesting because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

125
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a double album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very remarkable album and it</v>

126
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:46.260
<v Speaker 1>seemed oddly enough to fit in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange way.</v>

127
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean that whole double album fits </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a remarkable way even though</v>

128
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:55.011
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a diverse range of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a song formats that are incorporated </v>

129
00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think the.</v>

130
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So let's do a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we define what constitutes </v>

131
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.130
<v Speaker 1>avant garde period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily a term that people,</v>

132
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.250
<v Speaker 1>they've heard it undoubtedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people hear all sorts of,</v>

133
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call them terms.</v>

134
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>They hear all sorts of terms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not necessarily that haven't </v>

135
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.211
<v Speaker 1>been well defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could tell us about the avant </v>

136
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>garde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us why it attracted you,</v>

137
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 1>do you think as well?</v>

138
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

139
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:24.820
<v Speaker 2>to define the avant garde.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

140
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a military term and it simply means</v>

141
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:30.810
<v Speaker 2>the unfortunate souls that are the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into battle out there on the front</v>

142
00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

143
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I suppose that in the,</v>

144
00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:38.811
<v Speaker 2>in the artistic domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it simply means people who are engaging </v>

145
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:39.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in forms of artistic expression that are</v>

146
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 2>as yet untested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a,</v>

147
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:47.311
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly debate whether that </v>
<v Speaker 2>term is at all historically valid </v>

148
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:47.550
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

149
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and there's a strong case to be made for</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that the avant garde in a certain</v>

150
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.700
<v Speaker 2>sense basically no longer exists because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been so thoroughly,</v>

151
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized and written about and </v>

152
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>

153
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>very difficult these days to make a work</v>
<v Speaker 2>of art that actually shocks anybody,</v>

154
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of an interesting thing.</v>

155
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very recent phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>

156
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do absolutely outrageous things </v>

157
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

158
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 2>and have them be installed in public </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and it'll generate a certain </v>

159
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.141
<v Speaker 2>amount of civic controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing even remotely close to what </v>

160
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:20.860
<v Speaker 2>would have happened 60 years ago even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing,</v>

161
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.010
<v Speaker 2>an interesting phenomenon in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

162
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a kind of extraordinary </v>

163
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 2>tolerance for all sorts of artistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

164
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:34.300
<v Speaker 2>But you could also argue that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of societal indifference as well.</v>

165
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:34.930
<v Speaker 2>You could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

166
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.931
<v Speaker 2>the reason nobody's rioting and no one's</v>
<v Speaker 2>shocked and and seeking to have these </v>

167
00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 2>sorts of cultural forms bend is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it simply doesn't matter.</v>

168
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Those sorts of arts have been declawed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain sense.</v>

169
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's an argument you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make in that sense.</v>

170
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>People are so flooded with sounds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>images now too,</v>

171
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>that the sheer volume of those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we're to,</v>

172
00:08:55.531 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I also think inoculates us against or </v>
<v Speaker 1>also inoculate,</v>

173
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.560
<v Speaker 1>inoculate us against shock but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it more and more difficult to be </v>

174
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently original to actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that effect on people.</v>

175
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like people have dropped all </v>

176
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.300
<v Speaker 1>their taboos because you see that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Da,</v>

177
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the taboos about what can be said for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

178
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:21.141
<v Speaker 1>just shift around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it certainly does seem to be the </v>

179
00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>case that it's harder for artists to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

180
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.390
<v Speaker 1>to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>to play a role that it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose speaks to some degree to the </v>

182
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>degeneration of cultural norms around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around all sorts of different areas.</v>

183
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Because if there are strongly </v>
<v Speaker 1>established norms,</v>

184
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to violate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty interesting because it</v>

185
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.000
<v Speaker 1>also means you can't be a revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless there's a half decent tire around</v>

186
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me End,</v>

187
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

188
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think the avant garde </v>

189
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 1>attracted you instead of it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

191
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.410
<v Speaker 1>it would have been more typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for someone who started out </v>

192
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.710
<v Speaker 1>composing pop songs to continue in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>vein,</v>

193
00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:58.990
<v Speaker 1>not to go down the rabbit hole of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avant garde,</v>

194
00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:01.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing for anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

195
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of reasons.</v>

196
00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

197
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.110
<v Speaker 2>the pop song format is interesting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

198
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 2>it only works if you stay relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to its parameters and if you start</v>

199
00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:19.741
<v Speaker 2>to stray too far outside of them than </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing basically no longer </v>

200
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.010
<v Speaker 2>functions as a pop song because it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer vernacular.</v>

201
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a fascination with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of forms of music and the pop song</v>

202
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:31.340
<v Speaker 2>is an incredibly difficult medium to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work within.</v>

203
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

204
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

205
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It gets completely unforgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working in basically a,</v>

206
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 2>an extremely compressed format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare for pop songs to be too </v>

207
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.551
<v Speaker 2>much longer than three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't really have much room to </v>

208
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.750
<v Speaker 2>maneuver and you certainly don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any room to maneuver structurally.</v>

209
00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean you pretty much have to stick to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the verse,</v>

210
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Chorus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verse,</v>

211
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:53.080
<v Speaker 2>chorus thing from the immense majority </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pop songs.</v>

212
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>There's been very little variation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that since since rock really since the </v>

213
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>

214
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that three minute length </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

215
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.850
<v Speaker 1>That was actually a commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition if I remember correctly,</v>

216
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but that structure verse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chorus,</v>

217
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:07.700
<v Speaker 1>verse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chorus,</v>

218
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.530
<v Speaker 1>what out of what did that originate?</v>

219
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

220
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 2>that's an extremely old forum and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly have a.</v>

221
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are broke forms such as the Rondo </v>

222
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.291
<v Speaker 2>or the returned mail though that have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely similar forum where you </v>

223
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:24.831
<v Speaker 2>alternate one fixed element that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>returning the same way essentially and </v>

224
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>then a secondary element that that sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gives you a certain degree of relief,</v>

225
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:32.340
<v Speaker 2>a certain degree of a contrast with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeding element,</v>

226
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's a chaos order interplay I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess of sorts.</v>

227
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>At least that's the way I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret it.</v>

228
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And why the three guards structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

229
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>why do you think instead of two chords </v>
<v Speaker 1>or four chords,</v>

230
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that's dominated?</v>

231
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if three chord structure is the bare </v>

232
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.400
<v Speaker 2>minimum that you need in order to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of harmonic tension basically,</v>

233
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

234
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in music,</v>

235
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.580
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

236
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.780
<v Speaker 2>you in tonal music anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very simple and effective </v>

237
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 2>polarity between the what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonic and the dominant degrees.</v>

238
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that was,</v>

239
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 2>that basically structured the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical period of the baroque period </v>

240
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 2>as well to it.</v>

241
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Unpack that for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for us.</v>

242
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And tell us what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that,</v>

243
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 1>why that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that works musically?</v>

244
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>White works aesthetically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

246
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>it's one of many possible strategies for</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

247
00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And in fact if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go beyond the broke into,</v>

248
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 2>into renaissance music or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

249
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 2>or even earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have this sort of strong </v>

250
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.520
<v Speaker 2>polarity between two opposing harmonic </v>
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>

251
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.460
<v Speaker 2>That was something that really came </v>
<v Speaker 2>about during the 17th century,</v>

252
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:40.850
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

253
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Conversational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>

254
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.720
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that I've noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>about many pieces of music is that they </v>

255
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.381
<v Speaker 1>sound like dialogues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an announcement on the one hand </v>

256
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:55.681
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the response on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and then there's an announcement </v>

257
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:55.681
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

258
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be based in dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>based analogically metaphorically,</v>

259
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe in dialogue you hear that in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical pieces as well.</v>

260
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

261
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of setting up an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>rudimentary story and extremely </v>

262
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.850
<v Speaker 1>rudimentary form of narrative in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that you start with that</v>

263
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 2>a region that is established that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you basically have as your home </v>

264
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>base essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>

265
00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:24.891
<v Speaker 2>you modulate to a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different harmonic region and through </v>

266
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 2>this process of modulating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move from</v>

267
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>your home base to somewhere else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates a tension.</v>

268
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It creates a nostalgia and it creates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>need for resolution.</v>

269
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of other ways you can </v>

270
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.250
<v Speaker 1>do right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

271
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.250
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>

272
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that made me that made me </v>

273
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:50.041
<v Speaker 1>think about right away is the proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of small children to do that with their </v>

274
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>mother in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the space around the mother is </v>

275
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.650
<v Speaker 1>defined as home territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because mother is familiar,</v>

276
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because if something </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong and mother is their mother </v>

277
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.800
<v Speaker 1>can fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so there's.</v>

278
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a zone around the child when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother is there,</v>

279
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.830
<v Speaker 1>where there is access to immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources that will fill in where the </v>

280
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.911
<v Speaker 1>child's skills are lacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what the child will do after </v>

281
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:22.681
<v Speaker 1>obtaining sufficient comfort from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the presence of mom is to go out far </v>

282
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>enough into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven by their curiosity,</v>

283
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>which which has an underlying biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

284
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 1>There's an exploratory system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives the child out there too.</v>

285
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.390
<v Speaker 1>It discovered new information and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extend their skills by pushing against </v>

286
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>the unknown and then when that when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>either get tired or when they go out far</v>

287
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>enough so that negative emotion as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of threat predominates,</v>

288
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.740
<v Speaker 1>they run back to their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it reminded me of that.</v>

289
00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a microcosm of the hero's </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>

290
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:56.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the journey from a safe and and</v>

291
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>defined plays out into the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a return.</v>

292
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even say that's the simplest </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

294
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the simplest story that also </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves transformation.</v>

295
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So it might be the simplest good story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

296
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>But I haven't mapped that on to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A chorus,</v>

297
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you call it?</v>

298
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Verse Chorus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

299
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:17.950
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

300
00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So that and that return to stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

301
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does that make sense?</v>

302
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 1>That mapping as far as you're concerned?</v>

303
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the,</v>

304
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 2>one of the main tenants of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

305
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:34.410
<v Speaker 2>the total harmonic system is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an eventual return to where you </v>

306
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.730
<v Speaker 2>started out at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

307
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 2>there's always the promise of a return </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end and that's the essential </v>

308
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.740
<v Speaker 2>structure that you see in pop songs as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

309
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally a,</v>

310
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:48.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a directional to td logical sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

311
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's extremely different from,</v>

312
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.790
<v Speaker 2>from renaissance music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically has a very,</v>

313
00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:59.791
<v Speaker 2>very weak degree of directionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to want to particularly </v>

314
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 2>go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sort of floats and uh,</v>

315
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.930
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thing that,</v>

316
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.790
<v Speaker 2>that music sort of window off in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other sort of direction.</v>

317
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any idea why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformational curd?</v>

318
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because there was a,</v>

319
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:19.291
<v Speaker 2>a need for a more dramatically intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of music and that certainly that </v>

320
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:24.661
<v Speaker 2>certainly took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took place during the Baroque and of </v>

321
00:16:24.661 --> 00:16:26.791
<v Speaker 2>course that's related to the power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural influence of the Catholic </v>

322
00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Church and the need to create forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>artwork that would be extremely dramatic</v>

323
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and expressive.</v>

324
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.970
<v Speaker 2>And in Baroque music you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensification of musical expression </v>

325
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite striking in a sense.</v>

326
00:16:37.301 --> 00:16:38.200
<v Speaker 2>You could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

327
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:43.230
<v Speaker 2>that strongly directional thrust that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in music developed even further </v>

328
00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:46.570
<v Speaker 2>in the classical and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>romantic periods as well,</v>

329
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>to the point where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

330
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>it becomes this sort of constant push </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards ever more cataclysmic forms of </v>

331
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.460
<v Speaker 2>expression until it actually ruptures </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fabric of music itself.</v>

332
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you no longer can contain this,</v>

333
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>this level of extra acidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

334
00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:07.171
<v Speaker 2>so let's go back a little bit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lots of the people that are </v>

335
00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:07.171
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I presume,</v>

336
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.220
<v Speaker 2>won't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

337
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.910
<v Speaker 1>temporal relationship between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of musical development that you </v>

338
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 1>just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you go back to the,</v>

339
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 1>to the medieval era and then just lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the periods of time across which </v>

340
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.900
<v Speaker 1>music developed and then we'll go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that idea of this cataclysmic </v>

341
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.590
<v Speaker 1>upheaval that sort of shattered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of music.</v>

342
00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Say in the 20th century.</v>

343
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Well there's only so far you can go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>because music has only begun to be </v>

344
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 2>written down in a way that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's reliably retrievable since the </v>

345
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:41.051
<v Speaker 2>late 14th century or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you try to go too much farther </v>

346
00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:45.550
<v Speaker 2>back than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with documents that are </v>

347
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.971
<v Speaker 2>extremely hard to decipher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know exactly what these </v>

348
00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:48.971
<v Speaker 2>things sounded like.</v>

349
00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>We've got about six years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

350
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 2>we've got about 600 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So roughly speaking,</v>

351
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 2>the renaissance period extends to about </v>
<v Speaker 2>1600.</v>

352
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.370
<v Speaker 2>So roughly between 1400 and 1600 and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baroque is usually said to end with the </v>

353
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:07.191
<v Speaker 2>death of bar in 1750.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a kind of no man's land </v>

354
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>that lasted 20 or 30 years where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a sort of in between period of,</v>

355
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.290
<v Speaker 2>of generalized experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't yet a strongly </v>

356
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 2>characterized style yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have classicism that starts</v>

357
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.750
<v Speaker 2>really towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the second half of the,</v>

358
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 2>of the 18th century and romanticism is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more difficult to pin down,</v>

359
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Beethoven is considered to be one of</v>

360
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>the earlier exponents of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

361
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a romantic style.</v>

362
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:40.401
<v Speaker 2>He died in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27 so that more or less takes us to the </v>

363
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:44.151
<v Speaker 2>end of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have something that you could </v>

364
00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:47.450
<v Speaker 2>plausibly call late romanticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that's very difficult to </v>

365
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.511
<v Speaker 2>define.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that sort of dovetails with </v>

366
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:50.511
<v Speaker 2>modernism.</v>

367
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So can you set out some of the defining </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of each of those,</v>

368
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 1>set out the defining features of each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those parks,</v>

369
00:18:55.931 --> 00:19:00.931
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you can walk us through </v>

370
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you expressed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly cataclysmic changes and </v>

371
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:09.310
<v Speaker 1>then that resulting in in sight 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century music.</v>

372
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.260
<v Speaker 1>That takes us back to the avant garde as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

373
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of categorizations are are </v>

374
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 2>generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>

375
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't take 200 years of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural endeavor and reduce them down </v>

376
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.460
<v Speaker 2>to a single word and of course these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are constantly flowing and,</v>

377
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and transforming and,</v>

378
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

379
00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:33.091
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of overlapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm contrasting movements happening at </v>

380
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:38.941
<v Speaker 2>any given time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is really just for the sake of </v>

381
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:38.941
<v Speaker 2>convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

382
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:39.160
<v Speaker 2>but if you want us to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generalization,</v>

383
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you could say that during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>renaissance,</v>

384
00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:45.811
<v Speaker 2>music was essentially linear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was essentially melodic and and </v>

385
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.850
<v Speaker 2>contrapuntal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words that you would have,</v>

386
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you would have individual voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual lines that would be flowing </v>

387
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.621
<v Speaker 2>along together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but music was not yet primarily thought </v>

388
00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:45.520
<v Speaker 2>of in terms of vertical or harmonica </v>
<v Speaker 2>sonorities.</v>

389
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:51.150
<v Speaker 2>That really starts to with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Baroque early in the 17th </v>

390
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.601
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baroque music has a much stronger </v>

391
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>harmonic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dimension to it.</v>

392
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

393
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 2>You could argue that it's harmonically </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat simpler than,</v>

394
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 2>than renaissance music because it's more</v>
<v Speaker 2>codified.</v>

395
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start getting the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatises on harmony.</v>

396
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 2>The first theoretical writings on music </v>
<v Speaker 2>also isn't the Baroque period.</v>

397
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.790
<v Speaker 2>It's also characterized by the use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>highly stylized and very strong dance </v>

398
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 2>rhythms</v>

399
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.320
<v Speaker 2>that the classical period is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>a simplification of the Baroque style </v>

400
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.731
<v Speaker 2>and a certain sentence and music became </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly divided between what you would </v>

401
00:21:56.731 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 2>call foreground and background elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

402
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:03.991
<v Speaker 2>you would have a very prominent melodic </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and then you would have an </v>

403
00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 2>accompaniment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the two are not necessarily of equal</v>

404
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:11.521
<v Speaker 2>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in the Baroque and the </v>

405
00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:13.411
<v Speaker 2>renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voices would have tended to be </v>

406
00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:13.411
<v Speaker 2>basically equal importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very,</v>

407
00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 2>there's very little foreground </v>
<v Speaker 2>background distinction in,</v>

408
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 2>in Baroque and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pre baroque music.</v>

409
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 2>So the classical style is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplification.</v>

410
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:23.680
<v Speaker 2>It's also a codification of musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>forums.</v>

411
00:22:23.681 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>symphony,</v>

412
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.980
<v Speaker 2>the string quartet a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concerto while the concertos with </v>

413
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.590
<v Speaker 2>broke for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it starts to take on the </v>

414
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.120
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other classical forms such as the,</v>

415
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 2>the sonata in the classical period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get this,</v>

416
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:42.800
<v Speaker 2>basically this is codification and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplification of the,</v>

417
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 2>of the basic tools of music in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical period.</v>

418
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>And in the classical period is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite extraordinary actually,</v>

419
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:50.370
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

420
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rather short lived period in </v>

421
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>which for a very brief span of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

422
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

423
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 2>an overlapping of popular and savant </v>
<v Speaker 2>styles.</v>

424
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.550
<v Speaker 2>So you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had sort of a vernacular dimension </v>

425
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.180
<v Speaker 2>in the classical period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had very simple popular forums and </v>

426
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:17.431
<v Speaker 2>popular forms of expression and you also</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the absolute highest degree of </v>

427
00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 2>musical science and they were combined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in every composer,</v>

428
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:24.961
<v Speaker 2>but certainly the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that comes to mind as having </v>

429
00:23:24.961 --> 00:23:27.721
<v Speaker 2>been the highest manifestation of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of the different qualities </v>

430
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:27.721
<v Speaker 2>is Mozart.</v>

431
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.600
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a unique historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>

432
00:23:57.601 --> 00:23:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

433
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't very many composers that </v>

434
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can achieve that.</v>

435
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.400
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be historically lucky that </v>

436
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.740
<v Speaker 2>the state of the musical language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're alive has to,</v>

437
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 2>has to coincide with your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

438
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.820
<v Speaker 2>need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.010
<v Speaker 2>to push the boundaries of your art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a,</v>

440
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.750
<v Speaker 2>that's an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a romanticism,</v>

441
00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:20.760
<v Speaker 2>more or less puts an end to that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

442
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it puts a tremendous degree of focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual.</v>

443
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an exacerbation of the idea of the </v>

444
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:30.280
<v Speaker 2>self and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

445
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>it elevates the subjective emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses of the artists to a,</v>

446
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.080
<v Speaker 2>to a very high realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you get these forms of individual</v>

447
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:45.081
<v Speaker 2>expression that begin to not really jive</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

448
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.460
<v Speaker 2>the underlying rules of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when things really get </v>

449
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.460
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

450
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that moves us into the,</v>

451
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.700
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

452
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you've just talked about the classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

453
00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The next one that comes along is </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic,</v>

454
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

455
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 1>What happens during the romantic period </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said Beethoven was nearly an </v>

456
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.190
<v Speaker 1>early manifestation of that with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of cataclysmic</v>

457
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.760
<v Speaker 2>starts off writing music that's strongly</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by Haydn who's,</v>

458
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:17.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's one of the most important </v>

459
00:25:17.761 --> 00:25:17.761
<v Speaker 2>classical composers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of his career,</v>

460
00:25:17.761 --> 00:25:22.201
<v Speaker 2>he's doing pieces that basically are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are destroying these forms from within.</v>

461
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

462
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to Beethoven works like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hammerklavier Sonata for example,</v>

463
00:25:27.131 --> 00:25:32.131
<v Speaker 2>or the late string quartet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically pulling apart these,</v>

464
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.730
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these forums in it,</v>

466
00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 2>in a rather ruthless way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

467
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

468
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.230
<v Speaker 2>just pulverizing them.</v>

469
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.260
<v Speaker 1>There's an analogy between that and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in other fields of endeavor.</v>

470
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the philosopher of science,</v>

471
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:12.391
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Kuhn talked about and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the developmental </v>

472
00:26:12.391 --> 00:26:12.391
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>

473
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>what's with these revolutions in stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when,</v>

474
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.480
<v Speaker 1>so for Piaget or for science scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>were working within,</v>

475
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.740
<v Speaker 1>let's call it an axiomatic theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then make it a create new data into that</v>

476
00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:33.811
<v Speaker 1>theory without disrupting the axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now along now and then some data </v>

477
00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:36.490
<v Speaker 1>would come along that didn't even fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the axioms.</v>

478
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And then that data would generally be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored for a while because no one knew </v>

479
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.070
<v Speaker 1>what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

480
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:47.071
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't reasonable to leap to the </v>

481
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that if your theory doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict something,</v>

482
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:52.251
<v Speaker 1>that it should immediately be scrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's always the possibility </v>

483
00:26:52.251 --> 00:26:56.091
<v Speaker 1>that the data itself is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and then something new comes </v>

484
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough to collapse the science.</v>

485
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.950
<v Speaker 1>In some sense all the way down to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstated assumptions which then have to </v>

486
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.461
<v Speaker 1>be recast now piaget thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something similar in terms of </v>

487
00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 1>developmental stages in children and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults that the same thing happened when</v>

488
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:16.461
<v Speaker 1>we were organizing our internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world and but </v>

489
00:27:16.461 --> 00:27:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Piaget coon seemed to be a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relativist and that he believed that </v>

490
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.160
<v Speaker 1>paradigm's could be in incommensurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really couldn't speak between </v>

491
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.941
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes them a precursor in some ways </v>

492
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:31.221
<v Speaker 1>to to post modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Piaget's point was that each stage </v>

493
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>transition in human cognition which was </v>
<v Speaker 1>accompanied by,</v>

494
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a descent into chaos of some sort.</v>

495
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.590
<v Speaker 1>As the anomalous data accumulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each stage that emerged was superior to </v>

496
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:50.640
<v Speaker 1>the one before it because you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you could do in that stage.</v>

497
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Plus you could do more and so piaget </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was actually progress along the </v>

498
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.000
<v Speaker 1>along the stage transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for coon,</v>

499
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.820
<v Speaker 1>although I think Kuhn is less a emphatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

500
00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>that many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of his readers seem to think.</v>

501
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for cone it was more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lateral transformation or something like</v>

502
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

503
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:15.651
<v Speaker 1>it's been a big debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds very much to me like </v>

504
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:16.350
<v Speaker 1>something similar is happening as </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical forms develop.</v>

505
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be impossible to make the </v>

506
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.441
<v Speaker 2>argument though that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is constitutes in any way a </v>

507
00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:25.700
<v Speaker 2>progression or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

508
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 2>an improvement over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really make that argument </v>

509
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 2>about musical forums because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always checks and balances.</v>

510
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 2>There are always pluses and minuses that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are attendant with any,</v>

511
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 2>any novel form of musical expression.</v>

512
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the good things that seems </v>

513
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.161
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish art from science in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense is that it isn't obvious that art </v>

514
00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:47.020
<v Speaker 1>is improving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

515
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas at least in principle,</v>

516
00:28:48.911 --> 00:28:53.911
<v Speaker 1>it seems obvious that science is </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving in that piaget way is that we </v>

517
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:57.790
<v Speaker 1>could do everything we could plus more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but art so maybe aren't really does have</v>

518
00:28:57.791 --> 00:29:02.791
<v Speaker 1>that structure that Thomas Kuhn talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where that paradigms are </v>

519
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:05.290
<v Speaker 1>incommensurate and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no progression where science has</v>

520
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:10.291
<v Speaker 1>the more Eddie and structure where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually something that you can </v>

521
00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:12.340
<v Speaker 1>regard as genuine progress.</v>

522
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do have is a constant </v>

523
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.750
<v Speaker 2>oscillation between two fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>states and music history,</v>

524
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:24.751
<v Speaker 2>which is you have periods of expansion </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods in which axioms are tested and </v>

525
00:29:26.051 --> 00:29:31.051
<v Speaker 2>rethought and periods of consolidation </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which you strip away and you simplify</v>

526
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a permanent feature of music </v>

527
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

528
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very interesting thing when </v>

529
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.300
<v Speaker 2>things start to get a little bit too </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>

530
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>there tends to be a counter reaction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tendency simplification.</v>

531
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Certainly that's what happened in the in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classical with regards to the </v>

532
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Baroque period.</v>

533
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>implies that the entire system overtime </v>

534
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 1>is oscillating around some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden mean or something like that.</v>

535
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that that thing actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in some sense because it would </v>

536
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
<v Speaker 1>where the appropriate place is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be dependent on the nature of the </v>

538
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.171
<v Speaker 1>landscape at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the case you're making is that </v>

539
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 1>despite that there's some boundaries on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement.</v>

540
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 1>There is so much chaos and which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

541
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:19.561
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much revolutionary transformation </v>

542
00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that the degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be,</v>

543
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the experimentation could be so extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would actually break the boundaries</v>

544
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:26.140
<v Speaker 1>of what people are willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

545
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept as music.</v>

546
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 1>There has to be,</v>

547
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 2>be a social contract between the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the artist and the,</v>

548
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:36.841
<v Speaker 2>and the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're making a totally hermetic </v>

549
00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:39.481
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're making an art that is not </v>

550
00:30:39.481 --> 00:30:39.481
<v Speaker 2>necessarily intended for public </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption.</v>

551
00:30:39.481 --> 00:30:41.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very delicate balancing act </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

552
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:46.111
<v Speaker 2>because artists have the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclination to explore and audiences </v>

553
00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:50.431
<v Speaker 2>have the natural inclination to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to things that are familiar to </v>

554
00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:51.340
<v Speaker 2>them and that are already satisfying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in some manner.</v>

555
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think that contract is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly?</v>

556
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:59.071
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously the audience also </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to stay exactly where they </v>

557
00:30:59.071 --> 00:30:59.140
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

558
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:04.250
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to speak in general </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of audiences because they're made </v>

559
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.520
<v Speaker 2>up of individuals and individuals have </v>
<v Speaker 2>wildly different approaches to music and</v>

560
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 2>wildly different tastes in music as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

561
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

562
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>one of the extraordinary things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>music is that it has so many different </v>

563
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 2>functions simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were to take all of the different</v>

564
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>functions that music fulfills and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract out the music part and then try</v>

565
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:24.901
<v Speaker 2>to understand what phenomenon could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly cover all of those different </v>

566
00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:29.311
<v Speaker 2>functions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be very hard pressed to think of </v>

567
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:29.311
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean music is,</v>

568
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:29.311
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a science,</v>

569
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a form of entertainment.</v>

570
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were just speaking about that,</v>

571
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.480
<v Speaker 1>the actual function of music and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

572
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:41.510
<v Speaker 1>let's pick it up there because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting issue and the </v>

573
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.921
<v Speaker 1>function and meaning of music and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would really like to hear your thoughts </v>

574
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:44.921
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

575
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:45.290
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go from there.</v>

576
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 2>You can't speak of the function of music</v>
<v Speaker 2>because music has so many different </v>

577
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.341
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem on the surface of it to be </v>

578
00:31:53.341 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Speaker 2>almost completely incompatible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have music that functions as a,</v>

579
00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 2>as a form of an expression of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>devotion,</v>

580
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.300
<v Speaker 2>but you have music as well that whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary focus is to get teenagers to go </v>

581
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.590
<v Speaker 2>out on dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a,</v>

582
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you have music that is crassly </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial,</v>

583
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you have music that is a meditative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sublime.</v>

584
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>You have music that represents the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest aspirations of mankind,</v>

585
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and music that is piped in through </v>

586
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:18.990
<v Speaker 2>elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

587
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that's just a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very partial list.</v>

588
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I could go on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

589
00:32:21.671 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolutely amazing phenomenon in</v>

590
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 2>terms of the sheer number of functions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

591
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>that it covers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

592
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

593
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it's good to dance to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for movies.</v>

594
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:35.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in anything you can possibly think of.</v>

595
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.600
<v Speaker 2>There's been some form of music device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those</v>

596
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 1>functions is actually a little universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact that that music seems to</v>

597
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 1>be useful in movies is a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>

598
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you go,</v>

599
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.830
<v Speaker 1>if you go see a movie that lacks music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

600
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you actually become aware of quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly that it lacks music and it,</v>

601
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 1>it's much more two dimensional in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that,</v>

602
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it,</v>

603
00:32:58.671 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more two dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more difficult.</v>

604
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>What the music seems to do is to Philly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in somehow for the,</v>

605
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.960
<v Speaker 1>for the locking context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

606
00:33:06.961 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it rich and,</v>

607
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 1>and moral Rio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even more surprising and it </v>

608
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 1>partly does that by exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the emotions that are being </v>

609
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.371
<v Speaker 1>portrayed but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously if you could say </v>

610
00:33:21.371 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 1>completely what the music is doing in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

611
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:25.810
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't need to put the music </v>
<v Speaker 1>in because you could just incorporate it</v>

612
00:33:25.811 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 1>into a story.</v>

613
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.390
<v Speaker 1>But you talked about elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing and movies among many other </v>

614
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:36.071
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those three things are </v>

615
00:33:36.071 --> 00:33:37.331
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily different because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously what's being piped into the </v>

616
00:33:37.331 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 1>elevator is there to what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

617
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:44.261
<v Speaker 1>the awkward silence something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that with something </v>

618
00:33:44.261 --> 00:33:45.800
<v Speaker 1>familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it takes the edge off being locked</v>

619
00:33:45.801 --> 00:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>in an elevator with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>multiple other primates that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never met.</v>

621
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And people make fun of it too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's denatured music in some sense.</v>

622
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 1>But obviously there's a demand and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement for it and a function.</v>

623
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

624
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.210
<v Speaker 1>while anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

625
00:34:02.211 --> 00:34:07.211
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about the multi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple contradictory and paradoxical </v>

626
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.010
<v Speaker 1>rules that music can play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's,</v>

627
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.900
<v Speaker 1>let's go a little deeper and why don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

628
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:15.970
<v Speaker 1>why don't you tell us what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think music is doing and why</v>

629
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:19.700
<v Speaker 1>it's so important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming it is in fact important,</v>

630
00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 1>it certainly seems to be.</v>

631
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

632
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.840
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to talk generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

633
00:34:24.841 --> 00:34:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at non Western cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the role that music plays in them,</v>

634
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:29.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

635
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it's often extremely different from what</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what we do with it.</v>

636
00:34:32.461 --> 00:34:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a south Indian music is,</v>

637
00:34:34.621 --> 00:34:35.190
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

638
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.030
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long and drawn out and it's a,</v>

639
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.430
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially melodic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no harmony in it.</v>

640
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.490
<v Speaker 2>These are extremely long forms and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

641
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you can't listen to them if you only </v>
<v Speaker 2>have five minutes.</v>

642
00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:48.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an entire experience.</v>

643
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.090
<v Speaker 2>A Tibetan music is very closely tied up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

644
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.590
<v Speaker 2>with ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

645
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of reinforcing certain order </v>

646
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:58.290
<v Speaker 2>of doing things in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

647
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.230
<v Speaker 2>there are all sorts of examples.</v>

648
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I think in more traditional societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more archaic societies.</v>

649
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>The music is rarely divorced from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding context.</v>

650
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not divorced from dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not divorced for masks,</v>

651
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:14.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not divorced from the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>context and one of the things you see as</v>

652
00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>cultural differentiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you could say developed,</v>

653
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but let's say differentiate is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

654
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a fragmentation of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their,</v>

655
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.360
<v Speaker 1>into their higher resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents,</v>

656
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the language of biology for example,</v>

657
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:35.651
<v Speaker 1>continues to expand as we develop higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>and higher resolution models of the </v>

658
00:35:35.651 --> 00:35:40.061
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a society has more and more </v>

659
00:35:40.061 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to specialize more in each</v>

660
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:46.251
<v Speaker 1>of the sub dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also both breaks things apart </v>

661
00:35:46.251 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>but also allows for their further </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

662
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 1>So we could say as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe as you go back into the past,</v>

663
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.930
<v Speaker 1>then the number of things that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening simultaneously along with </v>

664
00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.470
<v Speaker 1>music explicitly probably increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

665
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd been struck by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

666
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.090
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends told me about going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

667
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 1>a led Zeppelin concert in Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was sitting politely,</v>

668
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was from a culture where everybody </v>

669
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.251
<v Speaker 1>would have been standing up and cheering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dancing and clapping and dancing </v>

670
00:36:16.251 --> 00:36:16.251
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

671
00:36:16.251 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Because of the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was frowned upon there,</v>

672
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting because it's an,</v>

673
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an indication of that kind of </v>

674
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:25.570
<v Speaker 1>almost artificial fragmentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

675
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

676
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that analysis is absolutely </v>

677
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:30.920
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

678
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Baroque music for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

679
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:35.640
<v Speaker 2>what you have is a generalized it kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stylized version of dense.</v>

680
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:37.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as,</v>

681
00:36:37.391 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 2>as music that you would actually dance </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

682
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

683
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:45.901
<v Speaker 2>the entire broke period really rests </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon dense rhythms and that,</v>

684
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 2>that goes for pretty much everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bach ever wrote from,</v>

685
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:52.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the cantatas down to the Fuchs.</v>

686
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all based on dense rhythms.</v>

687
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:59.211
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting thing because </v>

688
00:36:59.211 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously nobody dances to a fugue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

689
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I suppose you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really its primary </v>

690
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.791
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very interesting thing happens where </v>

691
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:11.070
<v Speaker 2>you get music that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is no longer explicitly devotional.</v>

692
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:16.071
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not explicitly meant to be </v>

693
00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:16.071
<v Speaker 2>performed as part of a liturgical </v>
<v Speaker 2>service of some kind,</v>

694
00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:18.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily meant to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dense to either a.</v>

695
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at music as being a </v>

696
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.600
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon that's easily existed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>

697
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:29.601
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the amount of the span of </v>

698
00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:29.601
<v Speaker 2>time during which that's been the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

699
00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 2>is just a drop in the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very,</v>

700
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>very recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that that you would get several</v>

701
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>hundred or several thousand people to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sit quietly in a room while </v>

702
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 2>someone's playing and just sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

703
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's extremely recent.</v>

704
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:44.360
<v Speaker 2>That really only starts to happen in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

705
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 2>in really in the romantic period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of a,</v>

706
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:52.581
<v Speaker 2>of a concert per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's nothing else attendant on </v>

707
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:52.581
<v Speaker 2>the experience of the music.</v>

708
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and then pop concerts,</v>

709
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:59.071
<v Speaker 1>rock concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that additional material has </v>

710
00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:01.771
<v Speaker 1>been put back in the form of light show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes in more dramatic forms </v>

711
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 1>than not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the light show I suppose is as close</v>

712
00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:09.010
<v Speaker 1>as you can get to representing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>music is doing in a visual format.</v>

713
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was conscious.</v>

714
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I know that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

715
00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:18.691
<v Speaker 1>it was Ken Keasy in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his band of merry pranksters that </v>

716
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>first started to experiment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic lighting and that sort of </v>

717
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.141
<v Speaker 1>thing in California when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with Lsd back in the </v>

718
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:28.441
<v Speaker 1>sixties and they were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>synesthesia and I know there were </v>

719
00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:31.591
<v Speaker 1>classical composers who were playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that much earlier and I suppose as </v>

720
00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:33.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the non electronic format,</v>

721
00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:38.941
<v Speaker 1>you could chase that back an long way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of spectacle encompassing </v>

722
00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:38.941
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

723
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

724
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:45.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's circle around the musical </v>

725
00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:45.151
<v Speaker 1>element a bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

726
00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you've thought a lot about this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>also write poetry and I also want to get</v>

727
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:53.131
<v Speaker 1>back to the periods after the romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we never did finish that </v>

728
00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:53.550
<v Speaker 1>discussion about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the cataclysmic restructuring of musical</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms up into the modern period.</v>

730
00:38:57.671 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

731
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.240
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start by pursuing the,</v>

732
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the meaning issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

733
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 1>so you are gripped by music and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avant garde and,</v>

734
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and you thought about it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

735
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.230
<v Speaker 1>and you've laid out some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ordering functions of music for</v>

736
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:16.231
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a disordering function of </v>

737
00:39:16.231 --> 00:39:16.231
<v Speaker 1>music as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

738
00:39:16.231 --> 00:39:20.730
<v Speaker 1>so give us some more your thoughts about</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what music is doing for people </v>

739
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

740
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

741
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the deepest possible sense.</v>

742
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the fundamental aspects of music </v>

743
00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to try to define music,</v>

744
00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would probably have to conclude that</v>

745
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>it has two essential components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is time and when is sound,</v>

746
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to give too much of a </v>

747
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 2>higher resolution definition of music </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that because it very,</v>

748
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 2>very quickly starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts to exclude all sorts of things</v>

749
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are thought of his music.</v>

750
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the essential a basis of it.</v>

751
00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:56.321
<v Speaker 2>I would say that between the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the temporal dimension is the </v>

752
00:39:56.321 --> 00:39:57.710
<v Speaker 2>most important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fundamentally I would say what music</v>

753
00:39:57.711 --> 00:40:02.711
<v Speaker 2>allows you to do is to experience forms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time that we cannot experience in,</v>

754
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:07.190
<v Speaker 2>in so-called real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

755
00:40:07.191 --> 00:40:07.730
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

756
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:10.820
<v Speaker 2>in music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a sort of distension of,</v>

757
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 2>of actual lift time or a contraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have multiple things happening </v>

758
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.870
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

759
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:22.010
<v Speaker 2>you can have people enter into </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively a trance state where there </v>

760
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.190
<v Speaker 2>are no longer aware of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing thing.</v>

761
00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

762
00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.030
<v Speaker 2>a lot of music has that explicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>function to it.</v>

763
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

764
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music has always struck me as something </v>

765
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 1>like a four dimensional sculpture that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself in three dimensions.</v>

766
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:42.601
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to music and Stereo </v>

767
00:40:42.601 --> 00:40:45.480
<v Speaker 1>listening of course enhances this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see these notes spread out </v>

768
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.710
<v Speaker 1>spatially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

769
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.840
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the three dimensions that you're </v>

770
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:51.840
<v Speaker 1>capable of perceiving from an auditory </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

771
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And so there are these patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves moment by moment,</v>

772
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but the entire pattern stretches across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

773
00:40:58.691 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's pattern upon pattern as</v>

774
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:08.551
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's transforming patterns </v>

775
00:41:08.551 --> 00:41:10.921
<v Speaker 1>upon transforming patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's a very close analog to </v>

776
00:41:10.921 --> 00:41:15.001
<v Speaker 1>what the world is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's in its multiplicity of layers </v>

777
00:41:15.001 --> 00:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>that are all interacting in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far as anything is real.</v>

778
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:21.961
<v Speaker 1>It constitutes a pattern that repeats </v>
<v Speaker 1>either spatially or temporarily means </v>

779
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 1>things like smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

780
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.730
<v Speaker 1>a cloud of smoke is sort of pseudo real </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that sense because it doesn't really </v>

781
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 1>have any borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any real repetition,</v>

782
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it does persist across moments </v>

783
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of a,</v>

784
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>of a patterning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most things that we interact with do</v>

785
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 1>repeat at least to some degree.</v>

786
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:48.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what object permanence is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The repetition of something across time </v>

787
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.821
<v Speaker 1>and music seems to model the persistence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the transformation across multiple </v>

788
00:41:51.821 --> 00:41:53.520
<v Speaker 1>levels all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

789
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 1>and what you said about the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time is interesting because Murcia </v>

790
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's great historian of religions and </v>

791
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Freud himself both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both talked about the,</v>

792
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:09.071
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transformation of time and the </v>

793
00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:12.071
<v Speaker 1>transcendence of time in certain states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fried noted that dreams were really </v>

794
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 1>good at compressing time or extending </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and you know,</v>

795
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:19.721
<v Speaker 1>so people have that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they'll hear the alarm go off </v>

796
00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:23.231
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and instead of waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll incorporate the alarm sound into</v>

797
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>a dream that seems to have gone on way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way longer.</v>

798
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes hours longer than the alarm </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and the Lee ad,</v>

799
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:35.351
<v Speaker 1>it talks about the he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he concentrated mostly are much on the </v>

800
00:42:35.351 --> 00:42:39.431
<v Speaker 1>dream time of the last of the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians and they viewed normal time </v>

801
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:43.940
<v Speaker 1>is sort of ensconced inside of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal time.</v>

802
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>That was always present that that seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something like the time in which </v>

803
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 1>music unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

804
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Obviously these are ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated things so.</v>

805
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the musical time is,</v>

806
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.950
<v Speaker 2>is a very complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I,</v>

807
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.960
<v Speaker 2>if I listened to a piece of music that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes long in no way have I </v>

808
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.040
<v Speaker 2>actually experienced three minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>real duration.</v>

809
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an extraordinary thing and this </v>

810
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.531
<v Speaker 2>actually allows me to connect to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>question about the avant garde and </v>

811
00:43:13.531 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated me when I was a teenager was </v>

812
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I would be listening to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece,</v>

813
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.370
<v Speaker 2>a 20th century piece that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely short.</v>

814
00:43:21.371 --> 00:43:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It might be two minutes long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would,</v>

815
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I would not be able to comprehend it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

816
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:28.020
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fascinated media.</v>

817
00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 2>The idea that I would not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend a piece of music now </v>

818
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.480
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's that has something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with my personality and not </v>

819
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.510
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going to be fascinated by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of music that they.</v>

820
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:39.670
<v Speaker 2>That they find impenetrable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my case I did.</v>

821
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.770
<v Speaker 1>There's also something else to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is that because you're musically </v>

822
00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going.</v>

823
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to go a lot closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the edge of what's regarded as let's </v>

824
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.581
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional or even the edge of what's </v>

825
00:43:54.581 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 1>regarded as music before you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's impenetrable.</v>

826
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for the average listener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

827
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 1>which in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly include myself.</v>

828
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go that close to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge before I run into music.</v>

829
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>That's complicated enough so that I at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least have to listen to it multiple,</v>

830
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 1>multiple times before I understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterning and the repetition and it's a</v>

831
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 1>lovely thing to experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you listen to something complex,</v>

832
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 1>say the fifth or sixth time at pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it start to fail together.</v>

833
00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I really had that experience with Bach's</v>
<v Speaker 1>well tempered clavier,</v>

834
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:29.441
<v Speaker 1>which I had to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay's maybe 20 times before I would say </v>

835
00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:33.101
<v Speaker 1>I had anything remotely like enjoyment </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a but and that and that clicking </v>

836
00:44:33.101 --> 00:44:38.001
<v Speaker 1>together of those patterns also seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be beautiful in some sense.</v>

837
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet the music with your </v>

838
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.581
<v Speaker 1>understanding and in that meeting of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music with your understanding is that </v>

839
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.770
<v Speaker 1>tremendous revelation of beauty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth and and harmony and all of those </v>

840
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 1>things that that are so good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>

841
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life affirming.</v>

842
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.660
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a very strange thing about </v>

843
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:02.660
<v Speaker 1>music as well and I've noticed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

844
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.611
<v Speaker 1>like even nihilistic people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply nihilistic people and hopeless </v>

845
00:45:07.611 --> 00:45:12.441
<v Speaker 1>people still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be pretty damn depressed </v>

846
00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:15.831
<v Speaker 1>before music loses its vibrancy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>savor and and life affirming properties,</v>

847
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a really magical thing.</v>

848
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I would say that being open to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that you could enjoy </v>

849
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.421
<v Speaker 2>something even though perhaps it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult going the first few times you </v>

850
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:29.110
<v Speaker 2>listen to it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably a key aspect.</v>

851
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:34.130
<v Speaker 1>So that brings me back to this contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the composer and the listener.</v>

852
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Like see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what stops a lot of people,</v>

853
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and I would again include myself in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe particularly with regards to that </v>

854
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.391
<v Speaker 1>garde art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in order to put in the time and </v>

855
00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>effort that would be necessary for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and appreciate something like</v>

856
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 1>the well tempered clavier let's say I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to trust that there's actually </v>

857
00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.231
<v Speaker 1>something there and then I'm not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the wool pulled over my eyes and </v>

858
00:46:00.231 --> 00:46:03.521
<v Speaker 1>that I'm some kind of fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with a lot of avant </v>

859
00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:07.941
<v Speaker 1>garde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the potential problem is that </v>

860
00:46:07.941 --> 00:46:10.191
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to dismiss the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that you're being played for a </v>

861
00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 1>fool by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by tricksters and jokesters and frauds.</v>

862
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And of course you are more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that situation if you're listening to</v>

863
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 1>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

864
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 1>so I think part of people's hesitancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

865
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

866
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and unwillingness to throw themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>into something that's truly new is,</v>

867
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 1>is the suspicion that the emperor has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and that they're being played </v>

868
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.071
<v Speaker 1>for a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you decide how did you know what you</v>

869
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 1>should continue to listen to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

870
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.320
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

871
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.120
<v Speaker 2>let's pull that apart for a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you,</v>

872
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.510
<v Speaker 2>if you look at things like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical avant garde,</v>

873
00:46:46.511 --> 00:46:48.460
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>avant garde movements that took place,</v>

874
00:46:48.461 --> 00:46:50.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for the sake of argument,</v>

875
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.930
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer avant garde.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

876
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.540
<v Speaker 2>it's been thoroughly picked apart by </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians.</v>

877
00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:56.980
<v Speaker 2>There's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

878
00:46:56.981 --> 00:47:01.981
<v Speaker 2>a sort of extended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a critical process that's already taken </v>

879
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:05.650
<v Speaker 2>place and that's sort of sifted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>these artifacts and decided what's worth</v>

880
00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.480
<v Speaker 2>discussing and what's not worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing.</v>

881
00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.220
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

882
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 2>one of the incontrovertible facts of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of music history or art history in </v>

883
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:18.061
<v Speaker 2>general is that the works that are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer able to communicate something </v>

884
00:47:18.611 --> 00:47:23.611
<v Speaker 2>vitally important to that addresses a </v>
<v Speaker 2>present concern tend to fall out of </v>

885
00:47:24.401 --> 00:47:26.560
<v Speaker 2>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History is merciless,</v>

886
00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

887
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely merciless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean think of the tens of </v>

888
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 2>thousands of closers that were active </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the baroque period.</v>

889
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:34.730
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

890
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.810
<v Speaker 2>how many have we retained?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's maybe a dozen figures that are </v>

891
00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:43.770
<v Speaker 2>sort of still regularly performed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed and and generally known to the</v>

892
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

893
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

894
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:50.610
<v Speaker 2>there's an absolutely ruthless selection</v>
<v Speaker 2>process that goes on and of course one </v>

895
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.541
<v Speaker 2>of the fundamental difficulties of </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing a contemporary or modern </v>

896
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 2>forms of art is that that process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection hasn't taken place yet.</v>

897
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.640
<v Speaker 2>So you as a listener are necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged with that process to a certain </v>

898
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.090
<v Speaker 2>degree because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

899
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

900
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.010
<v Speaker 2>the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of selection hasn't,</v>

901
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 2>hasn't taken place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is an overwhelming likelihood that</v>

902
00:48:11.861 --> 00:48:16.861
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to hear might not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the highest standard statistical if </v>

903
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you figure that there are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to throw out a number of hundred </v>

904
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 2>thousand composers active in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

905
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>how many of them are geniuses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are producing work of </v>

906
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>the highest order?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

907
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.310
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a vanishingly small </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage.</v>

908
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say that,</v>

909
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 2>that none of them are doing extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>good work.</v>

910
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just that if you're coming to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>world for the first time and you're not </v>

911
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.130
<v Speaker 2>familiar with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

912
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.010
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sort of have the,</v>

913
00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:48.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the context to be able to navigate </v>

914
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 2>through that space with a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of certainty that you can sort of</v>

915
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 2>sniff out the good from the bad then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

916
00:48:50.591 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult.</v>

917
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good,</v>

918
00:48:52.711 --> 00:48:57.711
<v Speaker 1>it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good expansion of the metaphor </v>

919
00:48:57.711 --> 00:48:59.760
<v Speaker 1>of the avant garde because what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means is as an avant garde listeners,</v>

920
00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

921
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.860
<v Speaker 1>like the avant garde in a battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same if you're laboring on </v>

922
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.461
<v Speaker 1>the edge of musical composition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

923
00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:13.371
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a real sense and I mean </v>

924
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:14.220
<v Speaker 1>practical like day to day if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make any money,</v>

925
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but also that you're going to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future is extraordinarily low.</v>

926
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>So this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why play it like I would say,</v>

927
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:23.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

928
00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.780
<v Speaker 1>for the typical listener who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know anything about baroque music or </v>

929
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.090
<v Speaker 1>classical music or romantic music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

930
00:49:30.091 --> 00:49:31.860
<v Speaker 1>who has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is afraid of it or,</v>

931
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:37.220
<v Speaker 1>or who's afraid of being made a fool of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their ignorance when they first </v>

932
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:37.220
<v Speaker 1>enter into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

933
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.720
<v Speaker 1>which can easily happen in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite sad.</v>

934
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Why should they go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should go to the effort of listening</v>

935
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:49.311
<v Speaker 1>to what's truly new and why should they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it in Europe you've got overwhelming </v>

936
00:49:49.321 --> 00:49:51.230
<v Speaker 1>musical capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

937
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.530
<v Speaker 1>it's clear in your case.</v>

938
00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

939
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:54.010
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

940
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:54.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

941
00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 2>the sort of career aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of writing music that as you say,</v>

942
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 2>lies is sort of on the edges of what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizably musical to a broad public.</v>

943
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a higher risk game?</v>

944
00:50:04.331 --> 00:50:09.331
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were to say a try to start a rock </v>

945
00:50:09.331 --> 00:50:10.630
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.600
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

947
00:50:11.601 --> 00:50:12.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and write,</v>

948
00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:15.550
<v Speaker 2>write songs that were in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a conventional format,</v>

949
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you could certainly argue that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have just as much trouble if not more </v>

950
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Speaker 2>establishing myself than if I were </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing in a form of musical expression </v>

951
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:26.770
<v Speaker 2>that's more esoteric simply because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

952
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crushing amount of competition is </v>

953
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.631
<v Speaker 2>actually probably a lot greater in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that domain than in much more highly </v>

954
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 2>individualized forms of musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression and incense.</v>

955
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way you could argue that it's,</v>

956
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

957
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a difficult argument to make </v>

958
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>because it is very difficult in any case</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a career as a composer,</v>

959
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:53.141
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably somewhat easier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carve out a space for yourself if you're</v>

960
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840
<v Speaker 2>working in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a rather individual musical idiom </v>

961
00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 2>than if you're doing something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall culture is already completely </v>

962
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 2>central.</v>

963
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

964
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

965
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Then what about the listener though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

966
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.600
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy your argument,</v>

967
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:11.601
<v Speaker 1>but then the listener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I go back and listen to only </v>

968
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.920
<v Speaker 1>those composers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time has a conserved,</v>

969
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:18.180
<v Speaker 1>which by your own admission are </v>
<v Speaker 1>composers that in some manner,</v>

970
00:51:18.181 --> 00:51:21.240
<v Speaker 1>some mysterious manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have something to say,</v>

971
00:51:21.241 --> 00:51:23.070
<v Speaker 1>which I also don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

972
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:26.670
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That box still has something to say or.</v>

973
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the same as shakespeare I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>

974
00:51:28.861 --> 00:51:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious what it is.</v>

975
00:51:31.651 --> 00:51:34.710
<v Speaker 1>That remains to be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that.</v>

976
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has not fully incorporated all </v>

977
00:51:41.251 --> 00:51:45.480
<v Speaker 1>of the perceptual genius that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person had to offer it.</v>

978
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Bob hasn't been transformed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliche or into,</v>

979
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.860
<v Speaker 1>into implicit assumption or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

980
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that one of the things </v>

981
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.401
<v Speaker 1>that artists do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual or auditory is they teach people </v>

982
00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:02.940
<v Speaker 1>to see or hear the.</v>

983
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:07.320
<v Speaker 1>The impressionists are good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because obviously their works,</v>

984
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.410
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their works produced riots when they</v>

985
00:52:10.411 --> 00:52:15.411
<v Speaker 1>were first publicly displayed and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular way of seeing the world that </v>

986
00:52:15.661 --> 00:52:17.610
<v Speaker 1>has more to do with light than with </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm,</v>

987
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but for most people it's easy to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an impressionist painting.</v>

988
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:27.501
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems it's so embedded into our </v>

989
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:30.360
<v Speaker 1>visual language that there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that seems shocking.</v>

990
00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we've learned that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess part of the question is do </v>

991
00:52:35.551 --> 00:52:38.640
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do new composers teach us to,</v>

992
00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 1>to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once we've learned everything they </v>

993
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.420
<v Speaker 1>had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we not need their lesson anymore?</v>

994
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something like that.</v>

995
00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

996
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.850
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would say about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is we've used the word avant garde quite</v>

997
00:52:53.851 --> 00:52:58.851
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't like that term very </v>

998
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:00.741
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing I would say is that </v>

999
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:00.750
<v Speaker 2>just because something is unfamiliar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't therefore follow that at time</v>

1000
00:53:00.751 --> 00:53:02.040
<v Speaker 2>on guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1001
00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:07.041
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are forms of music that would be </v>

1002
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:07.860
<v Speaker 2>difficult for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a certain listener to assimilate,</v>

1003
00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but it might be something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written a hundred and 50 years ago.</v>

1004
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.300
<v Speaker 2>So it might be something that has in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain sense,</v>

1005
00:53:15.301 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 2>being thoroughly absorbed since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>

1006
00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's say certain listeners who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar with it or people who are </v>

1007
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.681
<v Speaker 2>familiar with the history of music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for someone who's never heard </v>

1008
00:53:27.681 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it takes someone,</v>

1009
00:53:28.621 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is living in a complete indifference</v>

1010
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1011
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 2>to art music in general and has never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard Bob.</v>

1012
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you played them a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1013
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 20 minute collection of fugues they </v>

1014
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 2>might find the experience completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerable.</v>

1015
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.110
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1016
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1017
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:49.130
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting is that the order great </v>

1018
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:54.101
<v Speaker 1>composers are still sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them avant garde for the bulk</v>

1019
00:53:54.351 --> 00:53:58.550
<v Speaker 1>of the population so that there's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger for,</v>

1020
00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:00.950
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what they were able to achieve.</v>

1021
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It still doesn't answer the question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>why those people in particular.</v>

1022
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to think that they were the </v>

1023
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 1>greatest exponents of their art and me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they were,</v>

1024
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many great exponents have died </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrecognized and,</v>

1025
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.220
<v Speaker 1>and some ones that are maybe not </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparatively mediocre have been brought</v>

1026
00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:24.200
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that happens very often,</v>

1027
00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:25.060
<v Speaker 1>but we would.</v>

1028
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a potential,</v>

1029
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.340
<v Speaker 2>a way to answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the great composers are</v>

1030
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:37.341
<v Speaker 2>the ones that fundamentally they own </v>
<v Speaker 2>their material more thoroughly and in a </v>

1031
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 2>more deeply personal way than other </v>
<v Speaker 2>composers and other words is the minimum</v>

1032
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 2>of what you might call neutral material </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their music.</v>

1033
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>material that is essentially,</v>

1034
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 2>that already exists that is almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>found material in a sense and that you </v>

1035
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:56.391
<v Speaker 2>don't have to work very hard to fashion </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something resembling a coherent </v>

1036
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:58.170
<v Speaker 2>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A great composer invents forms.</v>

1037
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 2>They invent a language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invent a universe.</v>

1038
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take enormous risks and I mean,</v>

1039
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:08.630
<v Speaker 2>these composers that we talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are familiar names to a very wide swath </v>

1040
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:10.080
<v Speaker 2>of the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beethoven,</v>

1041
00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:13.480
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an absolute avant garde,</v>

1042
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 2>asked in his time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1043
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:15.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1044
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1045
00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:19.710
<v Speaker 2>performances of a lot of his pieces were</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly shocking and truly upset people.</v>

1046
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1047
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very relative phenomenon,</v>

1048
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 2>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1049
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:25.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1050
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Bach was considered to be a composer by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of his life who was writing </v>

1051
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 2>overly thick turgid music that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to listen to,</v>

1052
00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 2>that was sort of tortured and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ridiculously complex.</v>

1053
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

1054
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:43.761
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any composer you can think of that that </v>

1055
00:55:43.761 --> 00:55:43.761
<v Speaker 2>is considered today to be among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greats as,</v>

1056
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 2>as at some point being horribly </v>
<v Speaker 2>denigrated and humiliated and spoken </v>

1057
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.860
<v Speaker 2>badly of by the public of their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a,</v>

1058
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.870
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a permanent feature of,</v>

1059
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.660
<v Speaker 2>of music history and</v>

1060
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.010
<v Speaker 1>what you'd expect to though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone who is,</v>

1061
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say going in the right direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who is way ahead of everyone else </v>

1062
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.491
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for them to </v>

1063
00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:11.941
<v Speaker 1>communicate what they're doing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for them to distinguish </v>

1064
00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:13.360
<v Speaker 1>themselves from the naked emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1065
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1066
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it Ezra pound has a,</v>

1067
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 2>has a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that artists or the or the </v>

1068
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 2>intensity of mankind,</v>

1069
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1070
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Pseudo pods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1071
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:22.850
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1072
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:28.410
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those parts get better off of </v>

1073
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't find anything of any value,</v>

1074
00:56:29.771 --> 00:56:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but now and then everyone moves in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1075
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's akin to the idea that dreams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy or are the pseudopods of,</v>

1076
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 1>of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of idea and very </v>

1077
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>might be the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact.</v>

1078
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.080
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1079
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your contention that you know of this</v>

1080
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:55.710
<v Speaker 1>explosive transformation that finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulted in,</v>

1081
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>in the radical transformations of music </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the 20th century.</v>

1082
00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you suppose those transformations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more radical than the proceeding </v>

1083
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.951
<v Speaker 1>transformations had been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets us there faster,</v>

1084
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 2>potentially more quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the,</v>

1085
00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the expansion and the development of </v>

1086
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 2>musical language from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

1087
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 2>from medieval times onwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened very,</v>

1088
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 2>very slowly for a very long period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for centuries.</v>

1089
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And then you could argue that it is more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or less coincides with the industrial </v>

1090
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts to,</v>

1091
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:33.840
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really starts to accelerate at an </v>

1092
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:33.840
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary pace.</v>

1093
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:37.490
<v Speaker 1>And so let's take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take that analogy further.</v>

1094
00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:42.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things start to accelerate at an </v>

1095
00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:42.491
<v Speaker 1>incredible pace in the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

1096
00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:47.900
<v Speaker 1>People get far wealthier and far faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they ever had likely in the history</v>

1097
00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:49.670
<v Speaker 1>of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1098
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.620
<v Speaker 1>and then perhaps that allows for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding of orchestras and the funding of</v>

1099
00:57:54.621 --> 00:57:59.621
<v Speaker 1>more full time musicians because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have a pretty rich society in </v>

1100
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:02.870
<v Speaker 1>order to have any musicians that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are actually doing that and nothing</v>

1101
00:58:02.871 --> 00:58:05.930
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have more leisure time as well.</v>

1102
00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1103
00:58:07.191 --> 00:58:07.730
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1104
00:58:07.731 --> 00:58:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's all working in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop.</v>

1105
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1107
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.010
<v Speaker 1>so it's happening faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All so.</v>

1108
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:18.170
<v Speaker 1>So walk us through the post romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>period and tell us what's,</v>

1109
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 1>what's happening and maybe we can then </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the modern like I mean modern </v>

1110
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:24.830
<v Speaker 1>contemporary period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1111
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.230
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to that.</v>

1112
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense you could say that the </v>

1113
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>structure is that had been coalescing </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the Baroque,</v>

1114
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.980
<v Speaker 2>the forums and the genres and so on </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to,</v>

1115
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.290
<v Speaker 2>they start to break up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the romantic era,</v>

1116
00:58:38.291 --> 00:58:43.291
<v Speaker 2>they become highly personalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get composers that have highly </v>

1117
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>individual projects and also very more </v>
<v Speaker 2>importantly,</v>

1118
00:58:44.741 --> 00:58:49.741
<v Speaker 2>you have composers that are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>break away from the patronage system </v>

1119
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from being essentially the servants of,</v>

1120
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:56.521
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nobility and start having </v>

1121
00:58:56.521 --> 00:58:59.190
<v Speaker 2>something akin to an individual career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Beethoven is often thought of as </v>

1122
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 2>being the sort of exemplary figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1123
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:06.931
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the one of the first </v>

1124
00:59:06.931 --> 00:59:08.731
<v Speaker 2>composers and music history to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write pieces strictly out of his own </v>

1125
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:14.551
<v Speaker 2>volition as something that he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express regardless of whether there was </v>

1126
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.690
<v Speaker 2>someone necessarily who wanted to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it or not,</v>

1127
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.390
<v Speaker 2>or even who wanted to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1128
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>

1129
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:24.590
<v Speaker 2>very fundamental change of perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>when that starts to happen.</v>

1130
00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's sort of,</v>

1131
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the dawn of the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual genius that,</v>

1132
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that rises in,</v>

1133
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:39.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe that rises in a conceptual space </v>
<v Speaker 1>also as a consequence of the ideas of </v>

1134
00:59:39.461 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment,</v>

1135
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.240
<v Speaker 1>what the enlightenment did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the renaissance,</v>

1136
00:59:43.241 --> 00:59:48.241
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the renaissance started to dignify </v>

1137
00:59:48.241 --> 00:59:50.380
<v Speaker 1>creative individuals with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>status that,</v>

1138
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of canonical data he's had.</v>

1139
00:59:53.401 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think you see that transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in visual art in,</v>

1140
00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:00.070
<v Speaker 1>in the medieval period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archetypal figures have this very,</v>

1141
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1142
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract.</v>

1143
01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Almost almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1144
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>almost an like modern animation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1145
01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't until the renaissance kicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1146
01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>especially in northern Italy where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine</v>

1147
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>people Christ say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mary start to take on recognizably </v>

1148
01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:27.301
<v Speaker 1>human forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become individuals identifiable </v>

1149
01:00:27.301 --> 01:00:30.571
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a two way process is </v>

1150
01:00:30.571 --> 01:00:33.091
<v Speaker 1>that not only is the deity becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiably individual instead of </v>

1151
01:00:33.491 --> 01:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>formulaic and abstractly represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a hero cliff,</v>

1152
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>but the individuals becoming dafydd at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point as well.</v>

1153
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to me to coincide with </v>

1154
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the great artist and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great independent artists,</v>

1155
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange concept.</v>

1156
01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And be also a function of wealth,</v>

1157
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization is even possible,</v>

1158
01:00:55.050 --> 01:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to take her back at the history </v>

1159
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.751
<v Speaker 1>and you look at maybe the master of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiated artistic and religious </v>

1160
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>form might've been something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaman,</v>

1161
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but the Sharman was fundamentally a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healer and that was his,</v>

1162
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that was his role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose how you could say in a </v>

1163
01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>sense how he made his living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just used all these cultural tools to</v>

1164
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1165
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>but his economic base in some sense was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot wider.</v>

1166
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1167
01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're in the 20th century and we're.</v>

1168
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And we have this plethora of novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical forms and that's happening </v>

1169
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot more musicians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more listeners.</v>

1170
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So the speed takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess another thing that happens </v>

1171
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>is that leaves the typical listener more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more in the dust.</v>

1172
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1173
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have plenty of composers even in the</v>

1174
01:01:45.051 --> 01:01:50.051
<v Speaker 2>romantic period that are writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially vernacular music that </v>

1175
01:01:50.051 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>doesn't push the boundaries terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ones that we've retained,</v>

1176
01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that contributed the most.</v>

1177
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And the ones that deviated the most from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of standard operating procedure</v>

1178
01:01:57.261 --> 01:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we simply,</v>

1179
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:04.210
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't retain the ones that were </v>

1180
01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:06.371
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that we're operating safely </v>

1181
01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:10.151
<v Speaker 2>within the bounds of what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was accepted conventionally to be </v>

1182
01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:10.151
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1183
01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:11.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a,</v>

1184
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a view of history that is extremely </v>

1185
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>filtered in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what it was like </v>

1186
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>actually to be alive in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1187
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 18,</v>

1188
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>70 and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see things from that perspective.</v>

1189
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.970
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1190
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that's the first thing.</v>

1191
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even with,</v>

1192
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>even with say rock music or any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre,</v>

1193
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>when you hear a band that was once </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered creative,</v>

1194
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>but you hear them 20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell that they're creative </v>

1195
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>because if the creativity was of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable sword,</v>

1196
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

1197
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it's become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say necessarily cliched.</v>

1198
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what happens to the artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't retained is their </v>

1199
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.001
<v Speaker 1>contributions become cliched because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else picks it up and you hear </v>

1200
01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>it implicitly in every other piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music that's being done.</v>

1201
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And so you listen back in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1202
01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:02.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in that that I haven't </v>

1203
01:03:02.481 --> 01:03:03.861
<v Speaker 1>heard before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems to me that the Beatles </v>

1204
01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 1>are a good example of that town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>

1205
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:10.371
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say so much their earlier </v>

1206
01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:10.371
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's got a vitality that,</v>

1207
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that is still somewhat compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there later,</v>

1208
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>music still strikes me as sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising.</v>

1209
01:03:18.391 --> 01:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't all been incorporated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1210
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.890
<v Speaker 1>into the rock lexicon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1211
01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 2>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly great music has a,</v>

1212
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.420
<v Speaker 2>has a depth and it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1213
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a semantic overload in a sense that,</v>

1214
01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:33.860
<v Speaker 2>that no matter how many times you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to it,</v>

1215
01:03:33.861 --> 01:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you can't actually exhaust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an extraordinary thing.</v>

1216
01:03:36.611 --> 01:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1217
01:03:40.091 --> 01:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>how can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1218
01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:42.900
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it leads me to conclude that the,</v>

1219
01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the peace must contain more than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>composer knowingly put into it in a </v>

1220
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1221
01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

1222
01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing for me to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a,</v>

1223
01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>a container that would have had to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>in less than a week,</v>

1224
01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1225
01:03:56.261 --> 01:04:01.261
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could listen to that hundreds or </v>

1226
01:04:01.261 --> 01:04:01.261
<v Speaker 2>thousands of times and never get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it.</v>

1227
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that he put in his $30,000,</v>

1228
01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His musical,</v>

1229
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:12.551
<v Speaker 1>his depth of musical capacity was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense that he could put a lot into a </v>

1230
01:04:13.011 --> 01:04:18.011
<v Speaker 1>very little space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you see the same thing with great </v>

1231
01:04:18.011 --> 01:04:21.011
<v Speaker 1>visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the same thing with great art </v>

1232
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:21.011
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greater the art,</v>

1233
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the more it's inexhaustible and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems surprising.</v>

1234
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>The counter example of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda I would say.</v>

1235
01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1236
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:32.450
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the really crassly commercial music </v>

1237
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>which capitalizes on what everyone knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and takes it that tiny step.</v>

1238
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It varies at some tiny step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's playing to the,</v>

1239
01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>it's playing to the almost already sated</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd and there's a niche in there </v>

1240
01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.680
<v Speaker 1>because it's good for people who want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be pushed very,</v>

1241
01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>a very tiny amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it dies very quickly because </v>

1242
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone can incorporate it's new </v>
<v Speaker 1>message almost immediately.</v>

1243
01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:54.320
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1244
01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:59.321
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole notion of inexhaustible and </v>

1245
01:04:59.321 --> 01:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing thing and it has </v>

1246
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>something to do with the depth.</v>

1247
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a great representation of the </v>

1248
01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Bible at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual representation that showed </v>

1249
01:05:08.711 --> 01:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>along the bottom was a graph showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each different chapter.</v>

1250
01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:16.421
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a graph with a line at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and there's however many thousand</v>

1251
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>chapters there are in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one represented by a bar,</v>

1252
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:26.160
<v Speaker 1>tiny bar stretching downwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the length of the bar was </v>

1253
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>proportional to how many times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter or verse,</v>

1254
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it was chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

1255
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Was Cross referenced in the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those were Crawford Cross </v>

1256
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.441
<v Speaker 1>referenced a tremendous amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there were curves drawn on top </v>

1257
01:05:39.441 --> 01:05:43.321
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linking all the cross references </v>

1258
01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:43.321
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this amazingly complex,</v>

1259
01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>hyperlinked document where everything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it refers to everything else and that </v>

1260
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:52.981
<v Speaker 1>gives it this insane depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way of exhausting it </v>

1261
01:05:52.981 --> 01:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>because there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>routes through it in some sentence.</v>

1262
01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1263
01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly true with great works </v>

1264
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1265
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.250
<v Speaker 2>they're like iridescent luminous objects</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1266
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1267
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that say different things depending on </v>

1268
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.240
<v Speaker 2>the angle at which you look at them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know you can,</v>

1269
01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:14.241
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can listen to a piece of music 10 </v>

1270
01:06:14.241 --> 01:06:15.150
<v Speaker 2>times over the course of a week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you've more or less exhausted</v>

1271
01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:17.070
<v Speaker 2>it in terms of what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it can say to you.</v>

1272
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.250
<v Speaker 2>You go back to the exact same piece 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years later and you won't.</v>

1273
01:06:20.251 --> 01:06:25.251
<v Speaker 2>You might don't recognize it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might hear it in a completely </v>

1274
01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:26.550
<v Speaker 2>different way because you yourself have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed in the intervening.</v>

1275
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing is the music is </v>

1276
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the music actually exists in the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you made it and so your additions </v>

1277
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.131
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've listened to your mood and </v>

1278
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>also the way you choose to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1279
01:06:39.441 --> 01:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's complex because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can concentrate on one instrument or set</v>

1280
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>of instruments as opposed to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can use them as the guide so </v>

1281
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:52.851
<v Speaker 1>you can concentrate on the baselines or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can concentrate on the sounds that </v>

1282
01:06:52.851 --> 01:06:56.681
<v Speaker 1>are much higher in the register and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you do that with a complex </v>

1283
01:06:56.681 --> 01:06:56.681
<v Speaker 1>piece of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1284
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different journey.</v>

1285
01:06:58.641 --> 01:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1286
01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's also extremely interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1287
01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:08.321
<v Speaker 1>So you were talking about how sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceleration of music in the 20th </v>

1288
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:08.321
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you,</v>

1289
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>why don't you pick up on that?</v>

1290
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Well really I mentioned earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that starts to take place</v>

1291
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:15.150
<v Speaker 2>with the industrial revolution and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1292
01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.210
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes up,</v>

1293
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it picks up extraordinary speed at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the 20th century.</v>

1294
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense you could say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of music in the 20th century</v>

1295
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:27.100
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not divorced from,</v>

1296
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world wars.</v>

1297
01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:34.050
<v Speaker 2>You cannot separate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also cannot underestimate the </v>

1298
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>enormous significance that that had on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of the art.</v>

1299
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly after the Second World War,</v>

1300
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:42.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a generalized sense amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>European musicians that,</v>

1301
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>that fundamentally in an old order had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been overturned and had,</v>

1302
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.640
<v Speaker 2>had proven to be absolutely rotten and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1303
01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:51.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

1304
01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.650
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

1305
01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.660
<v Speaker 2>an almost paroxysmal desire to get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that into,</v>

1306
01:07:58.010 --> 01:08:01.890
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into create entirely new musical worlds.</v>

1307
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.100
<v Speaker 2>And that was definitely allied with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1308
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.720
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this need to,</v>

1309
01:08:06.721 --> 01:08:07.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1310
01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:09.000
<v Speaker 2>to build a new and better society.</v>

1311
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't separate those two things and </v>

1312
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to try to imagine yourself as a</v>

1313
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>20 or 25 year old composer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>growing up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a Europe that's been absolutely </v>

1315
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1316
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:27.210
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that there's practically </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing left and you're trying to </v>

1317
01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:27.210
<v Speaker 2>rebuild on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of that,</v>

1318
01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:28.220
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1319
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:33.250
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the situation that the composer </v>

1320
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:36.071
<v Speaker 2>is born in that era we were faced with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you want to pretend as though </v>

1321
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:41.681
<v Speaker 2>nothing has happened and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go back to writing late romantic </v>

1322
01:08:41.681 --> 01:08:42.050
<v Speaker 2>music or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

1323
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you accept that fundamentally something </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous has taken place that you can't </v>

1324
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:52.301
<v Speaker 2>ignore it and if you want to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic artist and if you want to </v>

1325
01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>manifest the things that you can't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>but perceive,</v>

1326
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>then how do you do that and can you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that within the confines of a language </v>

1327
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that was associated with the period </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the war.</v>

1328
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's a somewhat simpler fittings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a somewhat simplified account of </v>

1329
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.451
<v Speaker 2>events because certainly there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a push towards ever more </v>

1330
01:09:10.451 --> 01:09:13.810
<v Speaker 2>personal and individual forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression starting with the late 19th </v>

1331
01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really accelerates and takes off</v>

1332
01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:19.400
<v Speaker 1>to the after the Second World War and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of reasons.</v>

1333
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also that that's,</v>

1334
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that postwar period roughly </v>

1335
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:30.331
<v Speaker 1>speaking that was what grabbed your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention when you were composing your </v>

1336
01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:32.020
<v Speaker 1>pop songs as well and drew you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that particular rabbit hole.</v>

1337
01:09:32.021 --> 01:09:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1338
01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:34.630
<v Speaker 1>so back to the post war period.</v>

1339
01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the interesting things that </v>

1340
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>happened in Europe was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1341
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the need to reconstruct these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>states manifested also through a desire </v>

1342
01:09:45.311 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 2>on the parts of certain politicians to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1343
01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:51.880
<v Speaker 2>to show how advanced their societies </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be through the medium of art.</v>

1344
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany,</v>

1345
01:09:53.471 --> 01:09:56.230
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous sums of money were put into,</v>

1346
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

1347
01:09:57.431 --> 01:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>into music and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1348
01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:03.630
<v Speaker 2>they developed radio orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single region had its own </v>

1349
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.630
<v Speaker 2>orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1350
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.750
<v Speaker 2>very high levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1351
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.320
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1352
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:07.900
<v Speaker 2>of an artistic quality as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1353
01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:12.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so one corollary of that was that </v>

1354
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:13.980
<v Speaker 2>they wanted their music to be absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced and,</v>

1355
01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and absolutely striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1356
01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.960
<v Speaker 2>and that was a kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

1357
01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:25.650
<v Speaker 2>very strong impulse that began to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt in other European countries as </v>

1358
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:25.650
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1359
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their part,</v>

1360
01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:28.010
<v Speaker 2>had to also show that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in,</v>

1361
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:29.980
<v Speaker 2>in contemporary art and contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

1362
01:10:29.981 --> 01:10:34.981
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there was a very high degree of </v>

1363
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.220
<v Speaker 2>subsidization of the avant garde and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>postwar period.</v>

1364
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not to say that life was easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>for every artist because it most </v>

1365
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:44.521
<v Speaker 2>definitely was not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was an enormous struggle for </v>

1366
01:10:44.521 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 2>composers to produce this kind of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have it be performed,</v>

1367
01:10:46.151 --> 01:10:51.151
<v Speaker 2>but there was certainly a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment on the part of the European </v>

1368
01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:54.610
<v Speaker 2>states in terms of funding this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>musical expression.</v>

1369
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>So more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to have known instinctively,</v>

1370
01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:04.101
<v Speaker 1>even by your own argument that if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to rebuild that this was </v>

1371
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>going to be part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important part,</v>

1372
01:11:05.101 --> 01:11:10.101
<v Speaker 1>maybe a vital part of the rebuilding </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and you wouldn't think that </v>

1373
01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>necessarily because you would assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people's attention would be to what</v>

1374
01:11:13.651 --> 01:11:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you might regard as more practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns.</v>

1375
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.320
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we don't know what role music is </v>

1376
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:21.320
<v Speaker 1>playing precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm rolling,</v>

1377
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to figure out exactly</v>

1378
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:29.571
<v Speaker 1>what's practical and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeping People's morale up is of </v>

1379
01:11:29.571 --> 01:11:34.030
<v Speaker 1>incredible important or restoring their </v>
<v Speaker 1>morale as well as incredibly important </v>

1380
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe above all else.</v>

1381
01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1382
01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the essential functions of art</v>

1383
01:11:41.711 --> 01:11:44.320
<v Speaker 2>is his spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether people know it or not.</v>

1384
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want to rebuild your </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

1385
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:49.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no better way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then through the medium of art,</v>

1386
01:11:49.961 --> 01:11:51.250
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a.</v>

1387
01:11:51.251 --> 01:11:56.251
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolutely fundamental thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fundamental that even in the </v>

1388
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>most in the midst of the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences a human being can be,</v>

1389
01:11:59.621 --> 01:12:04.621
<v Speaker 2>there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a redemptive experience to be </v>

1390
01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:04.621
<v Speaker 2>had in art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1391
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1392
01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really to say something.</v>

1393
01:12:07.611 --> 01:12:12.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is to say something because </v>

1394
01:12:12.611 --> 01:12:14.741
<v Speaker 1>there's often you can find people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations often where nothing else </v>

1395
01:12:14.741 --> 01:12:18.431
<v Speaker 1>could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can't be matched by any other </v>

1396
01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:20.180
<v Speaker 1>means and many people have their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>saved by art.</v>

1397
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true on an ongoing basis.</v>

1398
01:12:23.151 --> 01:12:28.151
<v Speaker 1>Even with young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly when they're going </v>

1399
01:12:28.151 --> 01:12:28.151
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

1400
01:12:28.151 --> 01:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>late adolescent or even early </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent,</v>

1401
01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:35.351
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them live for music and music is</v>

1402
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:38.810
<v Speaker 1>helping them catalyze a group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but deeper than that,</v>

1403
01:12:38.811 --> 01:12:42.200
<v Speaker 1>it's also providing them with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit sense that there's meaning,</v>

1404
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>that the being is meaningful and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's meaning out hand and you can't </v>

1405
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.130
<v Speaker 1>argue with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's so cool,</v>

1406
01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:52.370
<v Speaker 1>especially about music is you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue with its meaning.</v>

1407
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:54.770
<v Speaker 1>It just manifests themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1408
01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:58.580
<v Speaker 1>it's outside of the domain of rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't criticize it.</v>

1409
01:12:58.581 --> 01:13:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You sound like a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1410
01:13:00.441 --> 01:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you dancing?</v>

1411
01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1412
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:06.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't a question,</v>

1413
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>and also there's no answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why are you listening to music?</v>

1414
01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is also not a question and there's not </v>

1415
01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.071
<v Speaker 1>an answer to it either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's self evident and it's almost self </v>

1416
01:13:18.071 --> 01:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>evident to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fantastically remarkable.</v>

1417
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 2>It is indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the last thing I would say about that</v>

1418
01:13:26.641 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>is that fundamentally the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1419
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that someone expresses them themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>through music,</v>

1420
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:35.430
<v Speaker 2>if it's authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally it's not a choice,</v>

1421
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing that,</v>

1422
01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:37.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1423
01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:39.420
<v Speaker 2>that audiences might keep in mind if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1424
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:42.060
<v Speaker 2>if they're about to engage with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's unfamiliar to them,</v>

1425
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>is that if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a half decent work of art and if</v>

1426
01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:47.880
<v Speaker 2>the composer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sincere in what they're doing,</v>

1427
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 2>then fundamentally it's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense they have to do.</v>

1428
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:52.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1429
01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:54.690
<v Speaker 2>there's not a strong element of choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>

1430
01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.020
<v Speaker 2>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an arbitrary thing to express </v>

1431
01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:00.020
<v Speaker 2>yourself in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1432
01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:00.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1433
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:02.620
<v Speaker 2>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

1434
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:03.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to choose.</v>

1435
01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I've also noticed like I've had more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than my fair share of creative clients </v>

1436
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.550
<v Speaker 1>probably I know certainly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attracted,</v>

1437
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come and see me by the content of my,</v>

1438
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.510
<v Speaker 1>my videos in my lectures and that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

1439
01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things,</v>

1440
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>and I studied creativity in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1441
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:28.410
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some depth and its relationship to </v>

1442
01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:30.631
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I found that </v>

1443
01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>really been struck by is that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait which is openness,</v>

1444
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:37.620
<v Speaker 1>which is a fundamental trait and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are high in openness is if </v>

1445
01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.281
<v Speaker 1>you imagine the person as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a central trunk with a few branches </v>

1446
01:14:41.281 --> 01:14:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and the branches are the place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nourishment emerges up into the </v>

1447
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>back of course too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

1448
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a pathway of life along those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those subdivisions of the trunk.</v>

1449
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're creative,</v>

1450
01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.420
<v Speaker 1>that might be the main part of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's alive and if that is manifesting </v>

1451
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.350
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just droop and die.</v>

1452
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they criticize them to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some themselves to death rationally or,</v>

1453
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1454
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:08.200
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1455
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can either pursue their creative </v>

1456
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:14.240
<v Speaker 1>nature or they can wilt and die that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1457
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.260
<v Speaker 1>but that's not much of a choice really </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking to me how fundamental a,</v>

1458
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:24.930
<v Speaker 1>an instinct that is and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how unrelenting it is and it manifests </v>

1459
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:28.870
<v Speaker 1>itself in their increased proclivity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasize and to dream and to,</v>

1460
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 1>and to find like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1461
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 1>a life inside of boxes that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

1462
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:36.730
<v Speaker 1>unbearable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really unbearable.</v>

1463
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a conventional person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative person isn't like that at</v>

1464
01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:42.490
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find that routine soothing and,</v>

1465
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:47.550
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the exercise of that predictable </v>

1466
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:48.850
<v Speaker 1>duty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and sustaining,</v>

1467
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but a creative person that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

1468
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just death for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1469
01:15:53.801 --> 01:15:55.650
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1470
01:15:55.740 --> 01:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>of creative artists who have had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>endure the most horrible suffering and </v>

1471
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:06.180
<v Speaker 1>just terrible material circumstances in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to pursue a singular creative </v>

1472
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:06.180
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

1473
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely amazing thing that you</v>

1474
01:16:07.961 --> 01:16:10.330
<v Speaker 1>think that people would voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject themselves to that.</v>

1475
01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:15.331
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you wonder is essentially </v>

1476
01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:15.331
<v Speaker 1>voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1477
01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's alternative,</v>

1478
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they are possessed to some degree</v>

1479
01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 1>by genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1480
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:27.691
<v Speaker 1>that's the genie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a major thing to possess a person </v>

1481
01:16:27.691 --> 01:16:27.691
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1482
01:16:27.691 --> 01:16:32.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental natural </v>

1483
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.010
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it voluntary?</v>

1484
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You can either cooperate with it or get </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed by it.</v>

1485
01:16:35.831 --> 01:16:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that's basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically that your choice.</v>

1486
01:16:39.431 --> 01:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's still a choice and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do interact with your creativity.</v>

1487
01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it just pours out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1488
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1489
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:52.470
<v Speaker 1>there's work that needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the sources there in some </v>

1490
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.200
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also extremely strange.</v>

1491
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.110
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just pull her out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it does in some people,</v>

1492
01:16:56.111 --> 01:17:01.111
<v Speaker 1>but they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to have developed the </v>

1493
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:01.111
<v Speaker 1>expertise necessary for that to occur.</v>

1494
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It still effortful and demanding more to</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's effortful and demanding and we</v>

1495
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 1>can leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1496
01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1497
01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So what was back to the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1498
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 1>since we're going to do the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a musical perspective,</v>

1499
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you talked about being attracted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avant garde,</v>

1500
01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:25.451
<v Speaker 1>poking up through in some sense because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your experimentation with integrating</v>

1501
01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:30.761
<v Speaker 1>that into pop songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that took you down this rabbit </v>

1502
01:17:30.761 --> 01:17:30.761
<v Speaker 1>hole that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that propelled you into your career as a</v>

1503
01:17:30.761 --> 01:17:35.711
<v Speaker 1>composer and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into moving to Europe and all of </v>

1504
01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:35.711
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1505
01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:39.550
<v Speaker 1>and you said that part of that was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you found some of what you were </v>

1506
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>listening to incomprehensible and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a mystery to you wanted to pursue.</v>

1507
01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:48.821
<v Speaker 1>It was that you see that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of your musical ability </v>

1508
01:17:48.821 --> 01:17:53.591
<v Speaker 1>trying to perfect itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found something you admired and </v>

1509
01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:54.110
<v Speaker 1>couldn't comprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what was it?</v>

1510
01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all could,</v>

1511
01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>could we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could we exchange the term rabbit hole </v>

1512
01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.741
<v Speaker 2>for four gleaming field of light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I would characterize it.</v>

1513
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

1514
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1515
01:18:09.161 --> 01:18:10.890
<v Speaker 2>how can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I explain this?</v>

1516
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a dragon with every gaming field</v>
<v Speaker 2>of light,</v>

1517
01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1518
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:19.410
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that I,</v>

1519
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I would I would hear and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinctively know are are deeply </v>

1520
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:24.550
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are so,</v>

1521
01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:29.820
<v Speaker 2>so meaningful that I almost can't begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fathom their depths and you don't </v>

1522
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.610
<v Speaker 2>necessarily understand them </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually.</v>

1523
01:18:30.611 --> 01:18:35.611
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand what how they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>made or or how they function or what </v>

1524
01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:39.961
<v Speaker 2>their component parts are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something in it that </v>

1525
01:18:39.961 --> 01:18:41.080
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally speaks to you on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a very,</v>

1526
01:18:41.081 --> 01:18:44.500
<v Speaker 2>very deep level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't explain why that is.</v>

1527
01:18:44.501 --> 01:18:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't explain why certain things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I that I've heard or that I heard when I</v>

1528
01:18:48.131 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>was a teenager had that effect on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were they.</v>

1529
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.840
<v Speaker 2>They were like invitations into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a,</v>

1530
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:58.300
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a world of seemingly limitless potential</v>

1531
01:18:58.301 --> 01:19:03.301
<v Speaker 2>that you cannot refuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a form of fascination that </v>

1532
01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 2>grip the grip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grip by the mercurial spirit.</v>

1533
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that</v>

1534
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.560
<v Speaker 1>curious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this thing that flips around that it </v>

1535
01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.441
<v Speaker 1>can't help but attract your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The God mercury and he's an emissary of </v>

1536
01:19:14.441 --> 01:19:14.890
<v Speaker 1>the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1537
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that,</v>

1538
01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:19.100
<v Speaker 1>and so if your interest is trapped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1539
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:24.101
<v Speaker 1>you find it spontaneously meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an invitation so you don't have to</v>

1540
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:26.900
<v Speaker 1>follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do follow it,</v>

1541
01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:30.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll find what you're being invited to</v>
<v Speaker 1>for better or for worse.</v>

1542
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1543
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1544
01:19:33.121 --> 01:19:38.121
<v Speaker 2>it's an instinctive sense that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is deeply meaningful and </v>

1545
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>you and you follow it and it takes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

1546
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what happened with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to,</v>

1547
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:46.601
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the composers have what's called the </v>

1548
01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:46.601
<v Speaker 2>second Viennese school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a,</v>

1549
01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trio of composers,</v>

1550
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Barragan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barragan,</v>

1551
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I was,</v>

1552
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:55.030
<v Speaker 2>it just instinctively fascinated by when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a teenager.</v>

1553
01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Now they're considered by some people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be difficult composers to get into.</v>

1554
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It really depends on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the work.</v>

1555
01:20:02.991 --> 01:20:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I would say there are pieces that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite accessible,</v>

1556
01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but there was something there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely fascinated me.</v>

1557
01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:13.521
<v Speaker 2>And once I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I understood that that world </v>

1558
01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:17.031
<v Speaker 2>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it extremely difficult to go </v>

1559
01:20:17.031 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>back to what I had been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>previously.</v>

1560
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Now my music has absolutely nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>common with,</v>

1561
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.180
<v Speaker 2>with theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1562
01:20:22.181 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 2>it's stylistically very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different,</v>

1563
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a question of wanting to do the</v>

1564
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:29.220
<v Speaker 2>same thing necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

1565
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:34.300
<v Speaker 2>it was a sign that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enormous world of exotic knowledge </v>

1566
01:20:36.151 --> 01:20:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and experience to be had if you only pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1567
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

1568
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1569
01:20:42.931 --> 01:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a good phrase to think about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to life in general.</v>

1570
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good thing for people to know</v>

1571
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:51.930
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're living a life that's devoid of</v>

1572
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:56.931
<v Speaker 1>sufficient meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the probability that there's a </v>

1573
01:20:56.931 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things that you could be paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to that would rectify that.</v>

1574
01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple because you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>at states of mind that make that very,</v>

1575
01:21:01.411 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 1>very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is nice to know that those gaming</v>

1576
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:08.210
<v Speaker 1>fields exist and that you can pursue the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flickers and,</v>

1577
01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find out where you're going to go.</v>

1578
01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm gonna close this by pointing out </v>

1579
01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 1>to everyone that Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrea has a patriotic count,</v>

1581

1582
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1583
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.510
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1584
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>has been made a lot of videos,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a number of different videos helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide people through the musical </v>

1589
01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:45.231
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complex musical landscape and which </v>

1590
01:21:45.231 --> 01:21:45.231
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be a very useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavor.</v>

1591
01:21:45.231 --> 01:21:49.700
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much for talking to me and </v>

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.870
<v Speaker 1>with everyone that's listening and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I suspect we'll do this again in </v>

1593
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

1594
