WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

2
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>when we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>when I saw the video that you put up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it two days ago now?</v>

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two days ago.</v>

6
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:29.541
<v Speaker 1>And the next morning I got an email from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother who also studies symbolism </v>

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart person.</v>

9
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:34.731
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Jordan know he's incarnating pepe </v>

10
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:34.731
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

11
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the funny thing is,</v>

12
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about pappy,</v>

13
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>but what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing like that on my mind when </v>

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.871
<v Speaker 2>I made the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never even entered my mind that that </v>

15
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.211
<v Speaker 2>was an association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was just concentrating on this </v>

16
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:52.691
<v Speaker 2>kermit thing that had popped up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably popped up about two years ago </v>

17
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time someone said that I </v>

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.550
<v Speaker 2>So I went and listened to Kermit and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have a voice that similar to that I</v>

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 2>see I can get it lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my voice tends to rise up into my </v>

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into my cause of tension.</v>

23
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>So this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to do like,</v>

25
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>so we need to do the metaphysics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>PIPPA.</v>

26
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>No one has done it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

27
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

29
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>

30
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:24.481
<v Speaker 2>and then then this strange occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course also also emerged with </v>

31
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.980
<v Speaker 2>regards to the mask that Charles had </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me wear the hat.</v>

32
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which it looks like Pippi has red lips,</v>

33
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 2>which is staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely staggering.</v>

34
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And so I just about fainted when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I posted that and people start,</v>

35
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>people pointed out the correspondents </v>
<v Speaker 2>with pepe.</v>

36
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just about fainted.</v>

37
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't happen very often.</v>

38
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.881
<v Speaker 2>Like I can only remember one other time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life when I was shocked enough to </v>

39
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 2>almost faint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that was just too much.</v>

40
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:58.241
<v Speaker 2>It was too much to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then thinking about the </v>

41
00:01:58.241 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 2>correspondence is since then it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

42
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

43
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

44
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 2>it's inexplainable and absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so much of this is inexplicably </v>

45
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

46
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted something yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I looked at maps of meaning my book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amazon,</v>

48
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 2>a seller lists to see where it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>located and it was number eight on,</v>

49
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>on books that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviorism andw ,</v>

50
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and it was bracketed by two other books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery.</v>

51
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Inbound is cheese book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's the person who invented the </v>

52
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>iat that's been used to fair it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unconscious bias.</v>

53
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one was a book by Richard </v>

54
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Bandler that I think was called frogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and princesses just.</v>

55
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>And then to find out about cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about CAC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

57
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.110
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then today I was thinking I was </v>

58
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.391
<v Speaker 2>watching Nina Paley who was an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius and she's animated the plagues </v>

59
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Moses called down on the Pharaoh.</v>

60
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 2>And of course one of the plagues was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plague of frogs.</v>

61
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

62
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

63
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frog</v>

64
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.560
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

65
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a perfect liminal character because </v>

66
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.060
<v Speaker 2>the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you tweeted about this as </v>

67
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frog lives both in water and on </v>

68
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:11.791
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like a,</v>

69
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>it has a monstrous characteristic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can cross.</v>

70
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that crosses </v>
<v Speaker 2>over between,</v>

71
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>between worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

72
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.560
<v Speaker 2>and so you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that in the story.</v>

73
00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:26.561
<v Speaker 2>It's the story of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the frog and the princess is a </v>

74
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.941
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he relates to the Pinocchio story </v>

75
00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>that we talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

76
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.650
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>princess goes to a pond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's playing with her favorite thing,</v>

78
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:38.701
<v Speaker 2>which is this golden ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she drops the ball just to </v>

79
00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 2>mention something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That golden ball is the same thing as </v>

80
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>the snitch that Harry Potter chases in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the quidditch games and Harry Potter.</v>

81
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because inside the snitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually part of Voldemort's soul,</v>

82
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

83
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's part of the soul of evil </v>

84
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 2>that's inside the Golden Ball and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>golden bowl.</v>

85
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>And Harry Potter has wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes it around chaos.</v>

86
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an alchemical symbol.</v>

87
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And the round chaos is a mercurial </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbol.</v>

88
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 2>And the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mercury is an emissary of the gods.</v>

89
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:12.901
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guards are speaking to you and when </v>

90
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 2>anything flickers in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>captures your attention,</v>

91
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 2>and in the quidditch game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who follows what captures his</v>

92
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>attention is the seeker and also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who wins.</v>

93
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Not so much the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the metagame.</v>

94
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>What's important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in this story,</v>

95
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>is that the ball is the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

96
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's golden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's golden.</v>

97
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So for her it's the idea that it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important thing.</v>

98
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So she drops this ball in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water it gets,</v>

99
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it gets lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she loses the most important thing.</v>

100
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>It falls into chaos,</v>

101
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the death of God purposes</v>

102
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.120
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just the idea of.</v>

103
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just the idea of,</v>

104
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the loss of innocence or you know,</v>

105
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you think about it in terms of </v>

106
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 1>the loss of the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this rog appears and says,</v>

107
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go get your ball if you,</v>

108
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you promise something for me.</v>

109
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the promise is that she will </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the frog with her into her castle.</v>

110
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Let the frog eat with her and then let </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog sleep in her bed.</v>

111
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when got those two things,</v>

112
00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>food and sex we talked about before as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

113
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>so she saw the frog goes down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and then brings up the most </v>

114
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.911
<v Speaker 1>important thing and the princesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to accept this frog in her.</v>

115
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't want to be like she's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoyed that she has to to to to to let </v>

116
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.721
<v Speaker 1>the frog into her house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat from a plate and then finally into </v>

117
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>her bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by doing that,</v>

118
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the fraud of course transforms into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prince.</v>

119
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Here you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

120
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we talked about before </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the most important thing goes out </v>

121
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.380
<v Speaker 1>into chaos and whatever can bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back,</v>

122
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it can bring it back to us has </v>

123
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>can be tamed and can enter into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>

124
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Can you find this place into the world</v>

125
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe even turns into this thing of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest value?</v>

126
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

127
00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:08.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something for people to really </v>

128
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:08.271
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About,</v>

129
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:08.940
<v Speaker 2>about marriages for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

130
00:06:08.941 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 2>people are always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is part of the profound</v>

131
00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:15.210
<v Speaker 2>immaturity of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are always running around waiting</v>

132
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:17.640
<v Speaker 2>to find the perfect person who's perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

133
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.760
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing you might think is that if you</v>

134
00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:25.761
<v Speaker 2>ever found the perfect person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would run away from you screaming </v>

135
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:29.661
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because and so that perfection is </v>

136
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:31.710
<v Speaker 2>something that you have to build within </v>
<v Speaker 2>a relationship.</v>

137
00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:34.500
<v Speaker 2>And so you accept the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

138
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Speaker 2>warts and all and hope that they do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same to you and swear that you won't run</v>

139
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:41.910
<v Speaker 2>from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as a consequence of that,</v>

140
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:46.911
<v Speaker 2>you can engage in a mutual process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation that emerges as a </v>

141
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 2>consequence of telling the truth and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

142
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:53.400
<v Speaker 2>and having a truthful relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as a consequence of that,</v>

143
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 2>the transformation can take place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might start with a frog,</v>

144
00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you end up with a prince.</v>

145
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So like we talked about the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is the structure of the world.</v>

146
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:07.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it happens as much on a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>level as it does on a,</v>

147
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 1>on a social level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a bigger,</v>

148
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.880
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger sense.</v>

149
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So just that little hint we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

150
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:17.641
<v Speaker 1>the story of Abraham and the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>angels coming and announcing the birth </v>

151
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>of a of Abraham's son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.330
<v Speaker 1>in the story of sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happens.</v>

153
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>The queen goes to the pond and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lo and behold,</v>

154
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:31.661
<v Speaker 1>there's a talking frog and the frog is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who announced it to the queen </v>

155
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:34.600
<v Speaker 1>that she will have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most beautiful child in the world.</v>

156
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is this idea of something coming </v>

157
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>from chaos.</v>

158
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Well that's interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

159
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 2>in the diagrams in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in maps of meaning,</v>

160
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 2>one of the diagrams is an egg shape </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

161
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the chaos into which things </v>

162
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.160
<v Speaker 2>plunge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But chaos is,</v>

163
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>it is an absolute state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>

164
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the state of the unknown as such.</v>

165
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.790
<v Speaker 2>And you never see the unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always see something that's partly </v>

166
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.020
<v Speaker 2>known and partly unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the frog is sitting on </v>

167
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.840
<v Speaker 2>the edge of the pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The frog enables you.</v>

168
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

169
00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:11.800
<v Speaker 2>the frog is an emissary of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

170
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.380
<v Speaker 2>And you always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only meet an emissary of chaos.</v>

171
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 2>You'd never meet chaos because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

172
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:16.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

173
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

174
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a non</v>

175
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 1>non non non existent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being,</v>

176
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:22.920
<v Speaker 1>it's below being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

177
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

178
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

179
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.730
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now this thing like,</v>

180
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things,</v>

181
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:30.210
<v Speaker 1>one is interesting is that kermit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog is,</v>

182
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>is the same thing because kermit is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a host,</v>

183
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a host on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a show.</v>

184
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:41.321
<v Speaker 1>And so what he does is he transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the transition between different </v>

185
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:45.821
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have an act and then you have </v>

186
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>this transitional figure which appears </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have another act.</v>

187
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the role that kermit the frog </v>

188
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>plays on the muppet show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

189
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Primary problem is ms dot peggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a really loud feminist.</v>

190
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.750
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now pepe,</v>

192
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 1>because well here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

193
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.840
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the metaphysics of Pippi.</v>

194
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So this is what's happening in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

195
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a very strange situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

196
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people like let's say the right,</v>

197
00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:16.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll call them the right or like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of order or the,</v>

198
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the let's say the norm,</v>

199
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>the people who create the norm for </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

200
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're in a situation where things </v>

201
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.801
<v Speaker 1>have been inverted and the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly in the narrative are the ones</v>

202
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:31.910
<v Speaker 1>who create the norm are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

203
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.660
<v Speaker 1>are being marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being pushed into the,</v>

204
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>into the margins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

205
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And to be told you're the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>create the norm and we're going to push </v>

206
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you out into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the margin.</v>

207
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

208
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 2>that's where they've identified with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>frog.</v>

209
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have identified with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

210
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

211
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.790
<v Speaker 1>what happens is there's a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>inversion that happens,</v>

212
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power of inversion and the power of </v>

213
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.030
<v Speaker 1>mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the power of,</v>

214
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>of humor is usually on the side of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cast.</v>

215
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It's usually on this side of the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the margin.</v>

216
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed like I noticed this happening </v>

217
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 2>about 20 years ago is all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right wing had all the comedians.</v>

218
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell's going on here?</v>

219
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>The right wing doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

220
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left.</v>

221
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 2>It has the comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that are poking fun.</v>

222
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 2>So strange that the comedians have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become the,</v>

223
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 2>the right wing has started to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in comedy.</v>

224
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

225
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a sign that there's a,</v>

226
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>there's this strange inversion that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

227
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's,</v>

228
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just a little footnote on this,</v>

229
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:41.061
<v Speaker 1>like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Bible there's a story that talks </v>

230
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:41.061
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the story of Elijah.</v>

231
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So the time will be Lija.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has been worshiping false gods </v>

232
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>because of the Queen Jezza Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

233
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 1>And Elijah who is supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophet of the God of that,</v>

234
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>of those people has become a marginal </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

235
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And so his name is Elijah the stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very odd because he's not a,</v>

236
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>he is supposed to be a prophet of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his tool,</v>

237
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>his mockery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He mocks the prophets of Baal.</v>

238
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see very often in the Bible where </v>

239
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the tool to kind of bring back order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>through mockery.</v>

240
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And so this is what we're seeing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this pip.</v>

241
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>A figure is that pep a is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an inversion machine.</v>

242
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

243
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

244
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>the people who use pippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they take something like</v>

245
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>an insult that's being thrown at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they flip it around,</v>

246
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>flip it around on those that insulted </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

247
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what you did with the kermit</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

248
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>which is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

249
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you see people are making fun of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they say you sound like kermit </v>

250
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

251
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take this and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it into my strength.</v>

252
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's what pip a pip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

253
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of the crazy stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of this tip,</v>

254
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>a thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

255
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of that.</v>

256
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dark things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Pipa,</v>

257
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:55.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things that like personally I </v>

258
00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:55.551
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want to touch.</v>

259
00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.470
<v Speaker 2>When I first saw the frog the frog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really recoiled from it.</v>

260
00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:03.471
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got this kind of underground comic </v>

261
00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:05.850
<v Speaker 2>horror associated with it that I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really find distasteful.</v>

262
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>So like sort of viscerally distasteful.</v>

263
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's supposed,</v>

264
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of supposed to do that to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that part of the power of,</v>

265
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>of those that are using that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that image,</v>

266
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>like it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it,</v>

267
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 1>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first comic,</v>

268
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:21.540
<v Speaker 1>like the first hippie comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you have a very crass but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's this,</v>

270
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.940
<v Speaker 1>this frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

271
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who goes to the toilet to urinate,</v>

272
00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:34.320
<v Speaker 1>but he pulls his pants down to his knees</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's doing something that usually</v>

273
00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:39.321
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pull your pants down to your </v>

274
00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:40.581
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit and do something </v>

275
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:40.581
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he does that.</v>

276
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:41.010
<v Speaker 1>But he stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's this.</v>

277
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And he shows us his backside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange power of inversion,</v>

279
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.170
<v Speaker 1>which actually brings the man to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

280
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's this double inversion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who use this,</v>

281
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this type of imagery are doing.</v>

282
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.710
<v Speaker 1>And so even it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say like the radical left wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying your,</v>

284
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.040
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

285
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a white male controlling </v>

286
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Blahblahblahblahblah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all these things.</v>

287
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And the people who use these pepe comics</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

288
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.770
<v Speaker 1>they say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll,</v>

289
00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:15.771
<v Speaker 1>and they reflect that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people who were accused </v>

290
00:13:15.771 --> 00:13:18.720
<v Speaker 1>them of that completely lose their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They completely lose their mind.</v>

291
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.370
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

292
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that I'm a racist,</v>

293
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.900
<v Speaker 1>this blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they reflect that back to them.</v>

294
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They invert it in a way because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

295
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>here you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you what you're telling me I </v>

296
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

297
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

299
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.610
<v Speaker 1>the radical left wing lose their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like.</v>

300
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at those people like the</v>

301
00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>alt right people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this strange,</v>

302
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.080
<v Speaker 1>strange magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

303
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Because look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Milo is Milo Yiannopoulos</v>

304
00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:48.360
<v Speaker 1>is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

305
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.050
<v Speaker 1>here is a half Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half Jewish,</v>

306
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:57.110
<v Speaker 1>gay Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump supporting enrichment Englishman </v>

307
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.280
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

308
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 1>and so not talking to the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

309
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And so nothing people can throw it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll stick on him because he is the</v>

310
00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he is that marginal figure standing</v>

311
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

312
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.790
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

313
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>he is that double in virgin and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of,</v>

314
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I know if he's trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it seems like he's doing is </v>

315
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 1>bringing order back through like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>double flip that's happening.</v>

316
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 1>It's very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very odd.</v>

317
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange time.</v>

318
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just say just just,</v>

319
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be careful.</v>

320
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous place to stand.</v>

321
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

322
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.160
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be careful.</v>

323
00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got lots of people that I'm talking</v>

324
00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:42.471
<v Speaker 2>to that are helping me formulate my </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments and articulate them properly </v>

325
00:14:42.471 --> 00:14:46.530
<v Speaker 2>and like I'm doing my best to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet on the ground and my eyes open and,</v>

326
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.650
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not to be angry about this,</v>

327
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:54.651
<v Speaker 2>but to be in the chaos really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not assume also that that's a </v>

328
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe because I don't know what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen to me.</v>

329
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the worst thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ever happened to me or the best </v>

330
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.150
<v Speaker 2>thing that ever happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell.</v>

331
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what'd you,</v>

332
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 1>what the solution will happen inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

333
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

334
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

335
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jonah gets pulled down by the whale </v>

336
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>down into the depths of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

337
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.820
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean and it's while he's in the </v>

338
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.511
<v Speaker 1>belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the solution comes to him like his </v>

339
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:19.511
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

340
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:24.101
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this moment of repentance where </v>

341
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:24.101
<v Speaker 1>he turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turns around.</v>

342
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Repentance is a flipping around and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the moment that he brings him into </v>

343
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:33.371
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into this baptism where he comes </v>

344
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:33.371
<v Speaker 1>out and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:33.371
<v Speaker 1>and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

346
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he goes into the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's another part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

348
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:36.850
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

349
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.490
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

350
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the solution is going to come out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this chaos right now.</v>

351
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's still great</v>

352
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a really complex problem,</v>

353
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 2>you have to go very far into chaos to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find a solution.</v>

354
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 1>But there's always the risk of losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you're in chaos.</v>

355
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

356
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

357
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:59.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about dragons is that </v>

358
00:15:59.111 --> 00:15:59.111
<v Speaker 2>they can eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

359
00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't like the new age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>age suffocation of Carl Young,</v>

360
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:07.631
<v Speaker 2>stinking and in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Joseph Campbell was responsible </v>

361
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.781
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although he did a lot of very good </v>

362
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:10.781
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

363
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronting the thing that you're afraid</v>

364
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:16.871
<v Speaker 2>of is that the thing that you're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of is genuinely terrifying and it can </v>

365
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 2>actually eat you and it's eaten plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people before you.</v>

366
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it's no joke and you know what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

367
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 2>During this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it ride so far.</v>

368
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

369
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going to happen,</v>

370
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 2>and especially in the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

371
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was being called a bigot,</v>

372
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things and being pilloried </v>

373
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.151
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least within the university for my </v>

374
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:43.151
<v Speaker 2>views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

375
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't obvious at all that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be any,</v>

376
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:50.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was going to be any way of </v>

377
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:50.250
<v Speaker 2>swimming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

378
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:50.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

379
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

380
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:56.430
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very disturbing because now you </v>

381
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.911
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically have these two monsters </v>

382
00:16:58.911 --> 00:16:58.911
<v Speaker 1>fighting each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:02.931
<v Speaker 1>like that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say this pepe type frog and you </v>

384
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hippie was declared a hate,</v>

385
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate symbol by the Anti Defamation </v>

386
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>League.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

387
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

388
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.801
<v Speaker 1>that's very frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's frightening that this is how far </v>

389
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:12.801
<v Speaker 1>it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much.</v>

390
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:17:14.071 --> 00:17:18.900
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they see that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the monster on the other side,</v>

392
00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but they don't see the monster on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

393
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

394
00:17:22.561 --> 00:17:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the LGBTQ,</v>

395
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.530
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

396
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I mEan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is itself a,</v>

397
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.560
<v Speaker 1>a liminal forum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look</v>

398
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that,</v>

399
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>that happened with the gender neutral </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns.</v>

400
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:41.681
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you blew the binary apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an endless multiplication of </v>

401
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>potential identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now was the chaos manifesting itself and</v>

402
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the ever expanding letters that go along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with lbgt is an example of exactly the </v>

403
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

404
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're marginalized.</v>

405
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're marginalized too.</v>

406
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're marginalized too.</v>

407
00:17:55.331 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 2>And how about us were also marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

408
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:03.490
<v Speaker 2>and I guess that's also partly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>each person has at least one element of </v>

409
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>that seriously marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marginalized in some manner.</v>

410
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

411
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rain.</v>

412
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting like the rainbow is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

413
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 1>is actually a perfect symbol because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rainbow is,</v>

414
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:14.770
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

415
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

416
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just a,</v>

417
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:17.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

418
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a fluid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a fluid thing or rambo is not six </v>

419
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>colors or rainbow is a spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors and there's,</v>

420
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is chaos itself.</v>

421
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the division of order into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinite amount of things.</v>

422
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

423
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:32.450
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

424
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>we typify a rainbow into six coLors but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually just the spectrum of.</v>

425
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And so it is in definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be separated indefinitely,</v>

426
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no limit to how much it can be.</v>

427
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.180
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that that's actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with the identity legislation.</v>

428
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:50.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

429
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 2>like marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that like an identity is a very </v>

430
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 2>important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

431
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.941
<v Speaker 2>And identity is something you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also something that you and I </v>

432
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:03.781
<v Speaker 2>play out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to negotiate your identity </v>

433
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:04.360
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a game in some sense,</v>

434
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but identity also has to have a function</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

435
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is also why the legislation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so pernicious because it just says,</v>

436
00:19:11.621 --> 00:19:13.570
<v Speaker 2>well your identity is whatever you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be.</v>

437
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

438
00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:17.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not because you have to live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

439
00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:22.681
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying you can play whatever </v>

440
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:22.681
<v Speaker 2>game you want to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

441
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:25.270
<v Speaker 2>well you can't because you got to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to play with.</v>

442
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.300
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were playIng together and you can </v>

443
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.300
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have to play my game.</v>

444
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Well I can tell you toddlers on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the school ground who say you have to</v>

445
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:37.081
<v Speaker 2>play my game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get shunned and then the game </v>

446
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:39.490
<v Speaker 2>itself has to be playable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing is that there,</v>

447
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are playable and non playable </v>

448
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 2>games and one of the things that piaget </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out,</v>

449
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.171
<v Speaker 2>the developmental psychologist piaget </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out about a game is that one of </v>

450
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the hallmarks of an acceptable game is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people want to play it voluntarily.</v>

451
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's another part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation that's so pernicious.</v>

452
00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:56.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

453
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:59.560
<v Speaker 2>you have a game and it's a game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've chosen subjectively,</v>

454
00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:02.170
<v Speaker 2>because that's what it says in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation and when,</v>

455
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:07.190
<v Speaker 2>when you come near me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to play my game whether you </v>

456
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.651
<v Speaker 2>want to or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the problem with that too is </v>

457
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:11.140
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where does that stop?</v>

458
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is it stops with </v>
<v Speaker 2>indefinite multiplication.</v>

459
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So the whole point of society is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce a game that somewhat arbitrary </v>

460
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.831
<v Speaker 2>that everyone can more or less play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sacrifice parts of themselves to </v>

461
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>play it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it it,</v>

462
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>it beats the total chaos of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

463
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.640
<v Speaker 2>of the war against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

464
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:31.810
<v Speaker 2>against all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

465
00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:33.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the hobbs zen right nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

466
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And life is nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutish and short.</v>

467
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.770
<v Speaker 1>This is A compliment to the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the metaphysics of pepe.</v>

468
00:20:41.771 --> 00:20:43.870
<v Speaker 1>The frog that I had with Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>

469
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>There are strains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations happening our world,</v>

470
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully understanding them will </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent the worst from taking shape.</v>

471
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 3>As I discussed with Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson,</v>

472
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 3>the frog is a type of hybridity as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amphibian.</v>

473
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 3>It exists in two worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

474
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.570
<v Speaker 3>so it becomes an image of the margin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another possible aspect of the margin </v>

475
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:12.211
<v Speaker 3>and the monster as we encounter it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be a shapeshifter shapeshift </v>

476
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 3>shifting like hybridity is the sign of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the place where categories fall apart on</v>

477
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 3>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the case of shape shifting.</v>

478
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 3>This characteristic because presented </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly as a power of the margin,</v>

479
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 3>is the power of fluidity like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickster,</v>

480
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 3>taking on several forms to operate his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mischief.</v>

481
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 3>To fully understand how pepe the frog </v>
<v Speaker 3>operates,</v>

482
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.190
<v Speaker 3>we need to understand how shape shifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>occurs and how it gives power to those </v>

483
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 3>who wield it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

484
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:48.181
<v Speaker 3>pepe has become a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly the most used meme of all </v>

485
00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:51.811
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his images floating on the internet and </v>

486
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 3>it can be produced by anyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

487
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 3>and so there are thousands and thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>of images of pepe ranging from a </v>

488
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:04.321
<v Speaker 3>glorified emoji to the most horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>scatological images you can imagine </v>

489
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 3>because pepe has become this chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fluid shape shifting thing.</v>

490
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.380
<v Speaker 3>He ends up acting like a mirror in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way water acts as a mirror,</v>

491
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.670
<v Speaker 3>and the way that works is that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so many images of pepe,</v>

492
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 3>when people look into that huge chaos of</v>
<v Speaker 3>images,</v>

493
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.960
<v Speaker 3>they can't encompass it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

494
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.500
<v Speaker 3>They have to mentally order it and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordering it they do that using their own</v>

495
00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:42.801
<v Speaker 3>mental patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as they project their thinking into </v>

496
00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:47.481
<v Speaker 3>this chaos and as they forced the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take shape becomes an image of their </v>

497
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:54.450
<v Speaker 3>own ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe their own ideological possession,</v>

498
00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 3>and so one of the things that has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening is that some people on the </v>

499
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.311
<v Speaker 3>right what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what some groups are calling the alt </v>

500
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:10.020
<v Speaker 3>righter or whatever have been using this</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect to act as a mirror against the </v>

501
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.951
<v Speaker 3>social justice warrior types and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>went so far that the sjws finally </v>

502
00:23:17.361 --> 00:23:22.361
<v Speaker 3>declared pip a hate symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The aNti defamation league said that </v>

503
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.190
<v Speaker 3>pepe was a hate symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this frog,</v>

504
00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:30.191
<v Speaker 3>this cartoon frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so ridiculous that the adl </v>

505
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:32.810
<v Speaker 3>finally scaled back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the language they use.</v>

506
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it was politically motivated,</v>

507
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.080
<v Speaker 3>but how could such a silly thing happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

508
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 3>certain images of pepe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few of them in the thousands,</v>

509
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.200
<v Speaker 3>thousands of images available had racist</v>
<v Speaker 3>themes and so there was a hitler pepe </v>

510
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.390
<v Speaker 3>and a k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k,</v>

511
00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:59.391
<v Speaker 3>k dot pepe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scheming jus african stereotyped using </v>

512
00:23:59.551 --> 00:24:01.890
<v Speaker 3>racist slurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cliche mexicans.</v>

513
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 3>All of these examples were floating with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thousands and thousands of </v>

514
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.170
<v Speaker 3>peppa images online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the social justice warriors </v>

515
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.450
<v Speaker 3>looked in this mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this pond of pepe images,</v>

516
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 3>all they could see were the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflected back to them their own </v>

517
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.440
<v Speaker 3>ideology or rather like a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an inversion,</v>

518
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 3>the dark shadow of their ideology.</v>

519
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately the accusation came that bay</v>

520
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:37.931
<v Speaker 3>is a racist symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hate image and the irony is very </v>

521
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 3>big because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one controls this image.</v>

522
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.020
<v Speaker 3>No one has any control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pepe is everything and anything and </v>

523
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:52.541
<v Speaker 3>nothing at the same time by declaring </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly that he's a hate symbol.</v>

524
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 3>That's two are pointing to their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurdity and this to the delight of </v>

525
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:03.731
<v Speaker 3>those that use this image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but heidi in this is an even larger ird.</v>

526
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.160
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the images that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out as being racist images.</v>

527
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.970
<v Speaker 3>There's this strange contradiction in </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

528
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.770
<v Speaker 3>You see on one side there is hitler pepe</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kkk pepe,</v>

529
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.290
<v Speaker 3>and there's a trump pepe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

530
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.470
<v Speaker 3>on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the scheming jew,</v>

531
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.050
<v Speaker 3>the african american,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mexican.</v>

532
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.030
<v Speaker 3>This means that pepe is that the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time the archetipal oppressor seemed </v>

533
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:42.330
<v Speaker 3>from the side of the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the while being the archetypical </v>

534
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.650
<v Speaker 3>scapegoat seen from the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor,</v>

535
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 3>that it's pepe is both sides of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

536
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 3>when the sjws look at that automatically</v>
<v Speaker 3>without even thinking,</v>

537
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.980
<v Speaker 3>they organize it through the ideology </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it exposes their program because the</v>

538
00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 3>automatically decide that when pepe is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitler or kick a care,</v>

539
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 3>trump pipa is identifying with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

540
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 3>but when he's a scheming jew or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mexican,</v>

541
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 3>pipa is mocking and criticizing those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

542
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Why is such an absurd image of hitler as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cartoon frog not seen as mocking </v>

543
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 3>hitler,</v>

544
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.420
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

545
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 3>all the stw users seeing is a reflection</v>
<v Speaker 3>of themselves,</v>

546
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 3>of their nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their shadow.</v>

547
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 3>The rather pathological desire we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen in the past few months to accuse </v>

548
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.540
<v Speaker 3>everyone being hitler or a neo nazi or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>white nationalist is an expression of </v>

549
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:52.761
<v Speaker 3>their secret desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire to be confirmed through an </v>

550
00:26:52.761 --> 00:26:57.081
<v Speaker 3>encounter with their projected other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's funny because the discourse of </v>

551
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:03.051
<v Speaker 3>otherness has been an ideological tool </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the left since the 19 sixties and now</v>

552
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 3>we're at a time when it has come back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>haunt them.</v>

553
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.640
<v Speaker 3>So by using this strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people have been wielding this </v>

554
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 3>pepper image have taken advantage of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>power of chaos,</v>

555
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.670
<v Speaker 3>taken advantage of what happens when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>frog jumps into the pond and goes down </v>

556
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:31.161
<v Speaker 3>to the bottom to find the golden ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I explained in my interview with Dr.</v>

557
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Peterson about the story of the princess</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the frog,</v>

558
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.600
<v Speaker 3>but the frog can't stay in the water </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

559
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point you have to finish the </v>

560
00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 3>story</v>

561
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.080
<v Speaker 3>to finish the story of the frog has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the golden ball and one could say </v>

562
00:27:56.961 --> 00:28:01.961
<v Speaker 3>that the golden ball is actually the sun</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will come up for the new day.</v>

563
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.220
<v Speaker 3>The frog has to get the golden ball and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it back to the surface of the </v>

564
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.920
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must carry the most important thing,</v>

565
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.750
<v Speaker 3>carry the seed of the new world to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>princess so that it can grow.</v>

566
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.400
<v Speaker 3>If that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no telling what else can come </v>

567
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.990
<v Speaker 3>out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the frog stays there for too long,</v>

568
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 3>it will be eaten or it will call some </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark or monster because there are other </v>

569
00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:38.540
<v Speaker 3>things down there beside the golden ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the frog contempt,</v>

570
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:43.541
<v Speaker 3>the leviathan to devour it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not as if this is impossible.</v>

571
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.950
<v Speaker 3>As the frog swims in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social justice warriors still </v>

572
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.380
<v Speaker 3>peering into the mirror and calling </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth its shadow.</v>

573
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.300
<v Speaker 3>You've already seen some intimations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this game,</v>

574
00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:03.170
<v Speaker 3>people are playing my race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something more than a new day.</v>

575
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raise the very monster,</v>

576
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:11.411
<v Speaker 3>the social justice warriors hope to </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter so as the frog swims in the </v>

577
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:15.670
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

578
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 3>How can it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can it recognize the golden ball </v>

579
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.570
<v Speaker 3>that is at the bottom of the pond </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's actually not easy to </v>

580
00:29:24.761 --> 00:29:27.580
<v Speaker 3>distinguish things when we're covered in</v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness</v>

581
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.890
<v Speaker 3>and the answer to this is in what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens in the story.</v>

582
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>The frog has to get out of the water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a prince.</v>

583
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:45.290
<v Speaker 3>The frog has to become something else </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bringing up the golden ball is the </v>

584
00:29:46.011 --> 00:29:49.280
<v Speaker 3>same thing as the transformation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog into a prince.</v>

585
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:55.490
<v Speaker 3>One cannot happen without the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so as Dr.</v>

586
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Peterson is often suggested in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>

587
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.450
<v Speaker 3>the way to do it is to sort ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

588
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.900
<v Speaker 3>is to go into our own self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>define the golden ball that is hidden in</v>

589
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:15.631
<v Speaker 3>the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go down and find the most important </v>

590
00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:22.031
<v Speaker 3>thing of western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dr.</v>

591
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Peterson has suggested the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing of western civilization </v>

592
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.230
<v Speaker 3>is the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This truth,</v>

593
00:30:31.231 --> 00:30:36.231
<v Speaker 3>that is the Word we have seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How noise has been the chaos used to </v>

594
00:30:37.321 --> 00:30:38.340
<v Speaker 3>drown the word.</v>

595
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 4>What I'm going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is freedom of speech?</v>

596
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell you a few things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking off this very carefully.</v>

597
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:55.110
<v Speaker 4>I've been thinking about this very </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully over the last two weeks </v>

598
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.550
<v Speaker 4>because of the videos,</v>

599
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 3>and so we must find the word for it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun that rises after darkness.</v>

600
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.480
<v Speaker 3>The word is the thing that comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death and lives again.</v>
