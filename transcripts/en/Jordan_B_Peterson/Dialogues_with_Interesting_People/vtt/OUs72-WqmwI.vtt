1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking today to clear layman who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's rich,</v>

3
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:25.161
<v Speaker 2>needed a magazine online called Colette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is become quite popular </v>

4
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:30.271
<v Speaker 2>and quite successful in relatively short</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time and it's certainly a </v>

5
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.251
<v Speaker 2>magazine that I've come to admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's staffed by real </v>

6
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:38.181
<v Speaker 2>journalists and so we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>today a little bit about how she's </v>

7
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 2>managed that and well in general and </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what her,</v>

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 2>her aims and ambitions are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess we might as well start.</v>

9
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.421
<v Speaker 2>Claire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could introduce yourself to my </v>

10
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:50.421
<v Speaker 2>audience and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell,</v>

11
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 2>tell them who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are and how you managed this.</v>

12
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a former graduate student in </v>

14
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.781
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before I went back to graduate </v>

15
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 3>school I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

16
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I was working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a couple of different jobs.</v>

17
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 3>My first degree was in English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I always wanted to be a teacher of </v>

18
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stories had that aesthetic interest.</v>

19
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I just had sort of a crisis in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate studies where I realized that </v>

20
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 3>wasn't for me and I wanted to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>

21
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:34.141
<v Speaker 3>but I knew there was nowhere that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>publish the stuff that I wanted to </v>

22
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 3>write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

23
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't I build my own platform?</v>

24
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 3>And in the back of my mind I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people that I knew,</v>

25
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 3>academics that I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

26
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.710
<v Speaker 3>who would also grab the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be published.</v>

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So what made you think that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody there that would publish the </v>

28
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that you wanted to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's fairly simple.</v>

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

31
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I was working on an article about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist called lead Justin,</v>

32
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 3>who he's a social psychologist who </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies the accuracy of stereotypes.</v>

33
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a long form,</v>

34
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 3>signed a article about a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>topic but completely contradicts a left </v>

35
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:26.711
<v Speaker 3>wing kind of narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those two things don't find an easy </v>

36
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:32.051
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of conservative places </v>

37
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

38
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 3>published sort of conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentary,</v>

39
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:39.671
<v Speaker 3>but it's often just about economics or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of partisan political battle.</v>

40
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 3>And it interested in sciences is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>very deep.</v>

41
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the place,</v>

42
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:51.221
<v Speaker 3>the best places for scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism such as the Guardian or wide </v>

43
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 3>or scientific American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't going mia.</v>

44
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Anything that contradicts very strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>left wing narrative such as stereotype </v>

45
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 3>accuracy or the biology of sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

46
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 3>intelligence research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's these areas of the behavioral</v>

47
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:15.091
<v Speaker 3>sciences that don't find a platform and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to create that platform </v>

48
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 3>and I also wanted to publish.</v>

49
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just scientific stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a sort of classical liberal and any </v>

50
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.731
<v Speaker 3>kind of commentary that doesn't indulge </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these regressive postmodernist kind </v>

51
00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 3>of narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to,</v>

52
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it a free space for that.</v>

53
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.270
<v Speaker 3>And some of my early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

54
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.440
<v Speaker 3>contribute is where one of my earliest </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributed.</v>

55
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Speaker 3>This was a guy called Geoffrey Taylor </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was an editor at the Atlantic and he</v>

56
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:55.001
<v Speaker 3>wrote for places like the new republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they stopped publishing his pieces </v>

57
00:03:55.761 --> 00:04:00.761
<v Speaker 3>because he became critical of Islam and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to write pieces that were </v>

58
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 3>critical of Islam and he couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>published even though he was this,</v>

59
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

60
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 3>they'd publish his other work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anything that he wanted to publish </v>

61
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 3>that was critical of Islam just wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get past stitches.</v>

62
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 3>So publish it.</v>

63
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you found was a implicit censorship</v>

64
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 2>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case.</v>

65
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 2>It's an exquisite censorship in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>

66
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:29.261
<v Speaker 2>so the stereotype literature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because one of the things </v>

67
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>the so called stereotype researchers </v>
<v Speaker 2>have failed to do is two distinct </v>

68
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.500
<v Speaker 2>stereotype from heuristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:39.501
<v Speaker 2>People use low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of the world all the </v>

70
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:43.691
<v Speaker 2>time too soon and it's absolutely vital </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do that we we cannot function </v>

71
00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without categorization and they.</v>

72
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I know this was a problem with bondage </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheets work and she did some of the </v>

73
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 2>early work on stereotyping and remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>she did a talk at Harvard when I was </v>

74
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.121
<v Speaker 2>teaching in Boston and she was taken to </v>
<v Speaker 2>task by the audience who weren't all </v>

75
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:06.131
<v Speaker 2>social psychologists for failing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguish between categorization and </v>

76
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>stereotyping and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's actually a really big </v>

77
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.330
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a trivial issue with regards to</v>

78
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:16.331
<v Speaker 2>the research and so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the name of the </v>

79
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 2>psychologist that you interview.</v>

80
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his name is Lee Justin.</v>

81
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 3>He's a psychologist at Rutgers </v>
<v Speaker 3>University and I'm.</v>

82
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Hey was one of the founders of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Heterodox Academy.</v>

83
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

84
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.701
<v Speaker 3>and he has a blog called rabble rouser </v>
<v Speaker 3>at psychology today and I discovered </v>

85
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 3>that back in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

86
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 3>and he had these amazing essays about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how he has battled group thing,</v>

87
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:50.041
<v Speaker 3>can left wing bias in his area of social</v>
<v Speaker 3>social psychology and he's got these </v>

88
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:56.341
<v Speaker 3>amazing anecdotes and stories about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>science in his particular area has not </v>

89
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 3>been self correcting.</v>

90
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well see psychology as being corrupt.</v>

91
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Discipline for about 25 years as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell.</v>

92
00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that reflected in things like,</v>

93
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political work that's been done.</v>

94
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.120
<v Speaker 2>So what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

95
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>system justification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

96
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 2>social psychology that's being put </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward by John Joseph,</v>

97
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a student of Missouri and bond and </v>

98
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 2>she on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

99
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely an implicit left bias</v>
<v Speaker 2>there because the notion fundamentally </v>

100
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 2>is that if you are justifying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current system in any way,</v>

101
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:39.591
<v Speaker 2>which means that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have some element of </v>

102
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:40.920
<v Speaker 2>patriotism in your thinking or believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the system isn't just an oppressive</v>

103
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:44.340
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that actually constitutes something</v>

104
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:48.390
<v Speaker 2>approximating a political pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

105
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 2>it's really pernicious because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

106
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.030
<v Speaker 2>it's built into the terminology rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than being an explicit part of the </v>

107
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.480
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

108
00:06:57.481 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that I noticed too that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was very interesting to me,</v>

109
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:05.661
<v Speaker 2>it took me decades to figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that there was people have been </v>

110
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:10.281
<v Speaker 2>studying the authoritarian personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically since the end of World War </v>

111
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:10.281
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>

112
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's the authoritarian </v>

113
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 2>personality scale that Adorno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

114
00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:19.650
<v Speaker 2>it's the theater or donor developed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:24.651
<v Speaker 2>for a long time I was trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out why in the world there wasn't the </v>

116
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>equivalent on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

117
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

118
00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:32.241
<v Speaker 2>I hate to speak in conspiratorial terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially a conspiratorial </v>

119
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:36.651
<v Speaker 2>movement that that's deeply embedded </v>
<v Speaker 2>within social psychology to deny the </v>

120
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.990
<v Speaker 2>existence of authoritarian authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendencies on the left wing.</v>

121
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.040
<v Speaker 2>No one's managing good authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>left weighing scale.</v>

122
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:49.041
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly because it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the tremendous denial post </v>

123
00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:54.651
<v Speaker 2>world war two that anything like leftist</v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism could exist and really </v>

124
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>took me a long time to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

125
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't understand why that glaring </v>
<v Speaker 2>absence existed.</v>

126
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:06.591
<v Speaker 2>And we've been trying to rectify that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lab and trying to do that in a </v>

127
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 2>politically neutral way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

128
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:12.060
<v Speaker 2>by doing a large scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a factor analysis of collections,</v>

129
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:17.061
<v Speaker 2>of political beliefs so that we can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it from a relatively objective </v>

130
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:21.231
<v Speaker 2>perspective without trying to drive home</v>
<v Speaker 2>some eight priority political belief.</v>

131
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you said you had a crisis in some </v>

132
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 2>sense when you were in graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 2>at pursuing psychology and what did that</v>

133
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:31.440
<v Speaker 2>consist of?</v>

134
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were lots of factors going on and </v>

135
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.471
<v Speaker 3>I had some issues with the course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing forensic psychology and I </v>

136
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:47.031
<v Speaker 3>found um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it was run a little bit flexible</v>

137
00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 3>and authoritarian and I'm a mother so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

138
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I had my son needs now for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the time was just the baby and I </v>

139
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 3>needed a lot of flexibility and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't accommodate me.</v>

140
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

141
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.450
<v Speaker 3>I just felt there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could offer more through writing and </v>

142
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 3>through communication of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

143
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Then being a practicing psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

144
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:17.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get into the full </v>
<v Speaker 3>backstory of what happened in my course,</v>

145
00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:19.060
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

146
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have have very cynical feelings </v>

147
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.030
<v Speaker 3>towards universities in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

148
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

149
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to graduate school at.</v>

150
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that I thought that,</v>

151
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering all of the rhetoric,</v>

152
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

153
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 3>helping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping women and helping people pursue </v>

155
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.731
<v Speaker 3>their creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that there would be some </v>

156
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 3>flexibility for a young mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there really wasn't an um,</v>

157
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was not the only issue though,</v>

158
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 3>other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

159
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.810
<v Speaker 3>it's said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I really wanted.</v>

160
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want it.</v>

161
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I was just what exactly it was that put </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on this alternative path.</v>

162
00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And so how long have you been running </v>
<v Speaker 2>quill out?</v>

163
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Since November 2015.</v>

164
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty new.</v>

165
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did you tell us how you did that</v>

166
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.200
<v Speaker 2>and how you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you've attracted writers and how </v>

167
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.431
<v Speaker 2>you've grown and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to know everything about </v>

168
00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:36.611
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including whatever it is that you're </v>

169
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:38.351
<v Speaker 2>doing for a monetization strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fact that you've been able </v>

170
00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:41.210
<v Speaker 2>to launch a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

171
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:46.211
<v Speaker 2>A new domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new enterprise devoted to journalism.</v>

172
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.550
<v Speaker 2>This really quite surprising because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

173
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you bailed out of psychology into </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism and I got out of the fire </v>

174
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 2>into the frying pan because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly something that you'd consider if</v>

175
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:02.000
<v Speaker 2>you had a business proposal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>presented that to someone who said,</v>

176
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:07.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start a new site devoted </v>

177
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:07.001
<v Speaker 2>towards journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd be laughed out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>venture capitalist's office because it's</v>

179
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:11.900
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult to monetize journalism</v>

180
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

181
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.340
<v Speaker 2>So tell me a little bit about how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you got this all going?</v>

182
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just brainstorming with my husband</v>

183
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 3>one night domain names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I knew that to start a website,</v>

184
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed an original domain name and we </v>

185
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 3>were just brainstorming and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where that came from,</v>

186
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 3>but it just came into my head and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked that up and that was available.</v>

187
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 3>So I bought the domain name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was running my own blog.</v>

188
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.660
<v Speaker 3>So I transferred my own log over to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>new domain and put all of my old essays.</v>

189
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Are Penn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>played around with what the website </v>

190
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.961
<v Speaker 3>would look like for about two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was playing around with these </v>

191
00:11:56.961 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 3>statistics and I'm not a developer so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to use sort of a website template </v>

192
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.920
<v Speaker 3>out of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the aesthetics were really important </v>

193
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 3>to me and I knew that if I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do something had to look really good and</v>

194
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:15.841
<v Speaker 3>so I was playing around with that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I put the word out through social </v>

195
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:21.871
<v Speaker 3>media that I was going to launch a site </v>
<v Speaker 3>and would anyone like to contribute and </v>

196
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:26.551
<v Speaker 3>I happened to have some context in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>social network who had essays up their </v>

197
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 3>sleeves.</v>

198
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.690
<v Speaker 3>My two first contributors were a Brian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Boutwell who is a criminologist at St </v>

199
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Louis University and Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's an excellent writer based in </v>

200
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 3>London and Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started.</v>

201
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:47.070
<v Speaker 3>His first essay was about being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminologist who studies biology and </v>

202
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:52.921
<v Speaker 3>about being shunned by his field and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize he was such a brilliant</v>

203
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 3>writer before I started writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me it just,</v>

204
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 3>it was just pure luck that he happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be such brilliant rider.</v>

205
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 3>The second essay that he published </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like 100,000</v>

206
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.911
<v Speaker 3>views in just a few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we immediately sort of exploded and </v>

207
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:16.561
<v Speaker 3>that was just due to the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>contributors that I had straight away </v>

208
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:21.330
<v Speaker 3>would be relatable for the first is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first one was on chrome,</v>

209
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.080
<v Speaker 3>biosocial criminology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second one was on behavioral </v>

210
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.791
<v Speaker 3>genetics and the essay was about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting might not shape your </v>

211
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 3>personality as much as you think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

212
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

213
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 3>he and he was explaining the data from </v>
<v Speaker 3>twin studies and um,</v>

214
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.870
<v Speaker 3>it was just such a well written and </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterintuitive kind of essay just </v>

215
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:57.271
<v Speaker 3>exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean lots of people disagreed with </v>

216
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:57.271
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

217
00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:57.271
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

218
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 3>it made a huge impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm.</v>

219
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Jake go to</v>

220
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.020
<v Speaker 2>the heart of the conflict between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social constructionist and the </v>

221
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.100
<v Speaker 2>biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

222
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a new word that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged.</v>

223
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's specific to Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>or north,</v>

224
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:16.501
<v Speaker 2>but the word is biological essentialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that seems to be like a social </v>

225
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>justice warrior code for Fascist as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell.</v>

226
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological essentialist seems to be </v>

227
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.131
<v Speaker 2>anyone who believes that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of biological influence on any </v>

228
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 2>element of human character whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

229
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.630
<v Speaker 2>last year I was concerned because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening in Canada that being </v>

230
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 2>a biologist was eventually going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal in some sense,</v>

231
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:45.151
<v Speaker 2>which I actually believe it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically a certain provisions of our </v>

232
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:49.861
<v Speaker 2>law because it's PLC 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that audio post last year,</v>

233
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:55.201
<v Speaker 2>which was passed nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has written social constructionism into </v>

234
00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:56.830
<v Speaker 2>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our law now,</v>

235
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.210
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was predicated on the idea that their</v>

236
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>relationship between biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression,</v>

237
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.520
<v Speaker 2>gender identity and sexual proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are all to this independent </v>

238
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 2>factors are in fact technically </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

239
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 2>That there is no causal relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between them.</v>

240
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And which is palpably absurd notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>

241
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 2>the correlation between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.100
<v Speaker 2>make biological males almost always have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male gender identity.</v>

243
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.740
<v Speaker 2>They almost always act and dress like </v>
<v Speaker 2>males and they're almost always hidden.</v>

244
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the correlations across the levels </v>

245
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.731
<v Speaker 2>are almost all or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or exceed point nine five across all of </v>

246
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>the levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet the law.</v>

247
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:46.271
<v Speaker 2>Now it's technically the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to treat those as independent and,</v>

248
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 2>and that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

249
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that they're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

250
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that it's tantamount to hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

251
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that it's close to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

252
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous animations that have been </v>

253
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 2>used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animated drawings,</v>

254
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:07.541
<v Speaker 2>like the ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genderbread person or the gender </v>

255
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:07.541
<v Speaker 2>Unicorn.</v>

256
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

257
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

258
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are being pushed forward </v>

259
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 2>very hard in institutions all across </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

260
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.460
<v Speaker 2>elementary schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior high schools,</v>

261
00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:18.930
<v Speaker 2>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police,</v>

262
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's this tremendous emphasis </v>

263
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 2>on the social construction of identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's as if a social constructionists</v>

264
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>have taken to the law to enforce what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot prove scientifically what </v>

265
00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:36.261
<v Speaker 2>they failed to prove scientific or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's even being disproved </v>

266
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 2>scientifically would be a more accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of thinking about it.</v>

267
00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Then the fact that there was an all out </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault on,</v>

268
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 2>on biology by the left is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>ominous in my estimation.</v>

269
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

270
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Just two things on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got an article coming out on </v>

271
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.460
<v Speaker 3>quizlet written by two evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists on the false dichotomy </v>

272
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.810
<v Speaker 3>between sex and gender and they give it </v>
<v Speaker 3>some historical context.</v>

273
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:09.481
<v Speaker 3>So the fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that false dichotomy I think started </v>

274
00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:09.610
<v Speaker 3>with Moonee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

275
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.670
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

276
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 3>and then it was weaponized by feminists </v>
<v Speaker 3>to deny biology entered,</v>

277
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.940
<v Speaker 3>denied sex differences basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

278
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Speaker 3>so that's a very strange thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists to do it.</v>

279
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.160
<v Speaker 3>One of</v>

280
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the things that James Damore has just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out lately,</v>

281
00:17:29.801 --> 00:17:31.960
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy that wrote that memo for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>

282
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.770
<v Speaker 2>is that the problem with denying the sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences is that you automatically </v>

283
00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:41.770
<v Speaker 2>make the argument that if there are sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>

284
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.580
<v Speaker 2>essentially they're making the argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the female differences or something</v>

285
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:49.300
<v Speaker 2>like inferior because why would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>object to their existence?</v>

286
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>And the Moore's memo was actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful because he said,</v>

287
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:58.611
<v Speaker 2>well we should take a look at these </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences and if we want to maximize </v>

288
00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:01.791
<v Speaker 2>the economic utility of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be a reasonable thing to </v>

289
00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:05.481
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we should actually have a serious </v>

290
00:18:05.481 --> 00:18:07.761
<v Speaker 2>discussion about what the differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and see if we can set up our </v>

291
00:18:07.761 --> 00:18:09.320
<v Speaker 2>institution so that we can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of the,</v>

292
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 2>of the difference in perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>

293
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 2>but the two sexes might bring to bear on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

294
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 2>on the workplace and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on economic issues in general.</v>

295
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And you don't use that happening because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are starting to sort themselves </v>

296
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.011
<v Speaker 2>out into occupations bisects essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

297
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:33.201
<v Speaker 2>the longterm social consequences of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't obvious and we don't know how to </v>

298
00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>balance that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

299
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.650
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't necessarily the case that it's </v>

300
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:38.650
<v Speaker 2>a bad thing.</v>

301
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my position has always been that </v>

302
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.510
<v Speaker 3>women have probably more to lose when </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex differences are denied.</v>

303
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 3>I think because of women's biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>clock and the fact that we bear much </v>

304
00:18:55.271 --> 00:18:59.590
<v Speaker 3>more of a burden when it comes to child </v>
<v Speaker 3>bearing and child weary.</v>

305
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.580
<v Speaker 3>If you denied that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.590
<v Speaker 3>women pay a huge price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

307
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 3>if you denied the fact that what women </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through that to bear children,</v>

308
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.710
<v Speaker 3>like firstly I think we need to separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>mothers out from women.</v>

309
00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:20.711
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of a completion when we </v>

310
00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:22.951
<v Speaker 3>talk about things like the gender gap </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a lot of the rhetoric </v>

311
00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:25.930
<v Speaker 3>implies that all women are discriminated</v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

312
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Speaker 3>The women who pay a penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our mothers and we need to talk about </v>

313
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.881
<v Speaker 3>that more and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't minimize the,</v>

314
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 3>the work and the sacrifice and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

315
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

316
00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:45.701
<v Speaker 3>the costs and the Nag that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>pouring into that.</v>

317
00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:48.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think when we deny sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

318
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 3>we sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

319
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.560
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we minimize and we sort of dismiss </v>

320
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.290
<v Speaker 3>everything that women do that is female </v>
<v Speaker 3>normative,</v>

321
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 3>such as caring and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

322
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 3>and working for others and sacrificing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for their children.</v>

323
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.960
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things.</v>

324
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

325
00:20:13.481 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a baby a month ago.</v>

326
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.640
<v Speaker 2>We were talking to her last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to finish up her degree.</v>

327
00:20:21.641 --> 00:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>She's also had some health problems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have interfered with that.</v>

328
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was talking to us last night about </v>

329
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.870
<v Speaker 2>and she looked tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had bags under her eyes.</v>

330
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's very happy to have the baby and </v>

331
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.881
<v Speaker 2>it's going very well and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the first year after you have a </v>

332
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically done.</v>

333
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get any sleep.</v>

334
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 2>You're absolutely overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for the first six months with</v>

335
00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>a new incident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

336
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.880
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a first time mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

337
00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:50.881
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking care of this incredibly </v>

338
00:20:50.881 --> 00:20:54.241
<v Speaker 2>complicated thing and it produces all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of biochemical changes and it's </v>

339
00:20:54.241 --> 00:20:58.471
<v Speaker 2>really hard on your body and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long recovery period and you're much </v>

340
00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>more dependent on your familial </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure than you were before.</v>

341
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.310
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the I like,</v>

342
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that we even have to have </v>

343
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.401
<v Speaker 2>this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like your distinction between </v>

344
00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:13.921
<v Speaker 2>women and mothers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one of the problems that I've </v>

345
00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:16.000
<v Speaker 2>had with classic feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could use that term,</v>

346
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>is that there's absolutely no respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>built into it for the maternal role.</v>

347
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's appalling on a variety of levels,</v>

348
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 2>including appalling for men because one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things I've experienced is that </v>

349
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I've had a pretty intense career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say I've been very fortunate in </v>

350
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.570
<v Speaker 2>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of,</v>

351
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 2>some meal you'll support and support </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my wife for that and you know,</v>

352
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:44.101
<v Speaker 2>we kind of parsed our life up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively traditional manner because </v>

353
00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 2>she was quite interested in having </v>
<v Speaker 2>children by the time we got together.</v>

354
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was perfectly willing to go along with</v>

355
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:55.550
<v Speaker 2>the artist if I could also continue what</v>
<v Speaker 2>might my career pursuits,</v>

356
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 2>which were also necessary for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial stability.</v>

357
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:03.210
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the domestic realm has been an </v>

358
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.340
<v Speaker 2>incredibly meaningful part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

359
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy in my marriage and </v>

360
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>blast I would say in my marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I loved having kids.</v>

361
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>

362
00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:17.731
<v Speaker 2>my home has always been a refuge from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the insanity of the world in some </v>

363
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think our society is,</v>

364
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazily skewed towards public </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

365
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:29.161
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that we've denied the utility </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the domestic sphere and that really </v>

366
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:34.651
<v Speaker 2>is terrible for women because especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to kids because that is </v>

367
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the role that they dominate,</v>

368
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

369
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 2>or Dominique did they contribute most </v>
<v Speaker 2>mightily to,</v>

370
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.970
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost as if our society </v>

371
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.020
<v Speaker 2>regards that as kind of an emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 2>innominate,</v>

372
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's crazy.</v>

373
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes people miserable</v>

374
00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:00.210
<v Speaker 3>and I understand why the early feminists</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of downplayed the domestic sphere </v>

375
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.540
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trapped in the domestic sphere</v>

376
00:23:06.541 --> 00:23:11.541
<v Speaker 3>and they wanted opportunities and I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those women who would have </v>

377
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 3>been an early feminist probably because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I crave intellectual stimulation and I </v>

378
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.221
<v Speaker 3>would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'd never had an opportunity to have </v>

379
00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:22.221
<v Speaker 3>a career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have been bored and that kind of</v>

380
00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:27.021
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now in 2017 I can go and get a job </v>

381
00:23:27.691 --> 00:23:30.980
<v Speaker 3>as a psychologist that can run a website</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

382
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 3>I can do everything that a man can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still biologically a female.</v>

383
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:41.961
<v Speaker 3>And so when it comes to having kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cost is on me and the women in my </v>

384
00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

385
00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:43.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

386
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 3>my own mother who super and comes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps with the children,</v>

387
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I see how we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't keep that status and prestige </v>

388
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:52.780
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

389
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 3>it's just this a male normative sphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can monetize something or </v>

390
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

391
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 3>public performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can,</v>

392
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.950
<v Speaker 3>we afford that status and prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this invisible caring work that </v>

393
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.120
<v Speaker 3>women are so good at and some women are </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptional that it's supported.</v>

394
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.970
<v Speaker 3>No prestige whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Austin,</v>

395
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed with kids,</v>

396
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:24.130
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though our little kids were very </v>

397
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:24.130
<v Speaker 2>well behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she was treated,</v>

398
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.040
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't treated well in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the public sphere,</v>

399
00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:29.750
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't treated well in restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people were afraid.</v>

400
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that was part of it in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

401
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:36.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were afraid that if she showed up </v>

402
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:36.851
<v Speaker 2>in a public place with children that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be disruption of one form or</v>

403
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:37.280
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

404
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.580
<v Speaker 2>but it was certainly the case that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say she received the opposite of </v>

405
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.721
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know my look deeply into </v>

406
00:24:46.721 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 2>architect will symbolism and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>function that it plays,</v>

407
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:52.451
<v Speaker 2>and of course one of the divine images </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sits at the bottom of western </v>

408
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only western culture,</v>

409
00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 2>is the image of the divine mother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother of the savior of humanity,</v>

410
00:24:58.251 --> 00:25:03.251
<v Speaker 2>which is an archetypal idea because </v>
<v Speaker 2>every baby has the possibility of </v>

411
00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 2>growing up to be a redemptive figure.</v>

412
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Now that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason that that's an </v>

413
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.651
<v Speaker 2>archetypal figures because any society </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't worship that so to speak </v>

414
00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:15.791
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give it a a very high value will</v>
<v Speaker 2>nourish the fact of the declining,</v>

415
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.540
<v Speaker 2>the catastrophic declining birth rate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West is a real example of our </v>

416
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.800
<v Speaker 2>willful blindness towards that sacred </v>
<v Speaker 2>image and it's a big problem and it is </v>

417
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 2>the case that I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

418
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 2>if the feminists we're actually working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on behalf of femininity,</v>

419
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.280
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what they claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would be working a hell of a </v>

420
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280
<v Speaker 2>lot harder to elevate the status of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mothers.</v>

421
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

422
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really good distinction</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're drawing,</v>

423
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:45.550
<v Speaker 2>even though it seems rather self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident.</v>

424
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're not the same once you become </v>

425
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:50.790
<v Speaker 2>a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a different sort of person.</v>

426
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:56.170
<v Speaker 2>And I also think women who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children or rather intimidated and </v>

427
00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.851
<v Speaker 2>afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's perfectly understandable </v>

428
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:02.030
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't radical transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say,</v>

429
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought this for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't actually become mature.</v>

430
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't actually become an adult until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have children.</v>

431
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.210
<v Speaker 2>And I know that that's a statement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>irritates the hell out of people,</v>

432
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I stand by it.</v>

433
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.230
<v Speaker 2>You're not an adult until someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters more than you do.</v>

434
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what it is to set,</v>

435
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.610
<v Speaker 3>to make real sacrifices.</v>

436
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

437
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially as a mother,</v>

438
00:26:28.391 --> 00:26:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you sacrifice yourself as the person of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prime importance and,</v>

439
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

440
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it,</v>

441
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I suppose happily in some sense because </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally you fall in love with your </v>

442
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.430
<v Speaker 2>baby relatively rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thank God for that because there are</v>

443
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 2>lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

444
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was recounting the story of my </v>

445
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.231
<v Speaker 2>daughter and she is trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was planning to take a course in </v>

446
00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:55.611
<v Speaker 2>biology online this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this semester in order to move towards </v>

447
00:26:55.611 --> 00:26:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the completion of her degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we told her last night,</v>

448
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>she said she was overwhelmed when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>went and talked to her last night and we</v>

449
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:05.481
<v Speaker 2>told her just to leave it be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>first year is so intense that you're,</v>

450
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.680
<v Speaker 2>you're completely overwhelmed by it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary because you want to get </v>

451
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.300
<v Speaker 2>your baby off to a good start and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that relationship functioning properly.</v>

452
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

453
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the issues I had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>my master's degree.</v>

454
00:27:23.021 --> 00:27:28.021
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't bring myself to do a thesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I wasn't going to have the </v>

455
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:32.881
<v Speaker 3>energy or the motivation to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead I created a website which is,</v>

456
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.700
<v Speaker 3>which also requires a lot of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's um,</v>

457
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of self generative because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people write articles,</v>

458
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:46.731
<v Speaker 3>they send them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I have to do is I'm a little bit of </v>

459
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:47.270
<v Speaker 3>editing and then posted it online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

460
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite as uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it absorbing as,</v>

461
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.540
<v Speaker 3>as writing a thesis which I wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do at this time.</v>

462
00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the things that I've been </v>

463
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:02.960
<v Speaker 2>studying and thinking about is high </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement in,</v>

464
00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.230
<v Speaker 2>among,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among people in general,</v>

465
00:28:05.231 --> 00:28:09.790
<v Speaker 2>and this is also something that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is given any serious consideration</v>

466
00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:11.770
<v Speaker 2>in our discussion of the differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the,</v>

467
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.870
<v Speaker 2>between the sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

468
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:18.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of people who are extremely </v>

469
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:18.910
<v Speaker 2>high achieving in any field is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

470
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.610
<v Speaker 2>And that depends on the per preto </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle essentially.</v>

471
00:28:21.611 --> 00:28:26.611
<v Speaker 2>And that's that that works itself out </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematically so that the square root </v>

472
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:28.870
<v Speaker 2>of the number of people in if domain do </v>
<v Speaker 2>half the work.</v>

473
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 2>So if you have 100 scientists working in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particular subfield,</v>

474
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.110
<v Speaker 2>then 10 of them will publish half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles.</v>

475
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at that tiny percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who were hyper productive,</v>

476
00:28:39.311 --> 00:28:41.180
<v Speaker 2>they're almost all men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So like in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the median number of publications for </v>

478
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.861
<v Speaker 2>men and women is very close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the high publishers are all mad and </v>

479
00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.270
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that is because in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in that category,</v>

480
00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:57.271
<v Speaker 2>not only do you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily smart and </v>

481
00:28:57.271 --> 00:28:59.731
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but associated with that </v>

482
00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to devote something </v>

483
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.721
<v Speaker 2>like 60 to 80 hours a week of solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to your job because otherwise </v>

484
00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:08.980
<v Speaker 2>people will out compete you.</v>

485
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's these extremely focused and </v>

486
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.220
<v Speaker 2>narrow people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More obsessive.</v>

487
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're absolutely obsessed with what </v>

488
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.540
<v Speaker 2>they're doing and they're quite rare and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're also the mystery that needs</v>

489
00:29:22.541 --> 00:29:27.541
<v Speaker 2>to be solved because you know the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that most people want to have a balanced</v>

490
00:29:28.001 --> 00:29:33.001
<v Speaker 2>life and that most people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely obsessed with the single </v>

491
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:36.421
<v Speaker 2>issue to the exclusion of all else is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually normally with behavior and </v>

492
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:39.901
<v Speaker 2>quite understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can this extreme a personality,</v>

493
00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:45.001
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly not something that </v>

494
00:29:45.001 --> 00:29:45.001
<v Speaker 2>I'm criticizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the common law.</v>

495
00:29:45.001 --> 00:29:49.830
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that it's a far more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing for women to manage </v>

496
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 2>because once you're responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else,</v>

497
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 2>like you are primarily responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>small children,</v>

498
00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>then it's extraordinarily difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate like that to the exclusion </v>

499
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:02.470
<v Speaker 2>of all else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

500
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a couple of women that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had professional relationships with.</v>

501
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Usually I usually worked in the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something like an executive coach in </v>

502
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 2>my clinical practice who kind of manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

503
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 2>But they're so they're so stretched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

505
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.970
<v Speaker 2>they were concerned with the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds that they have to microwave </v>

506
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.970
<v Speaker 2>their fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.690
<v Speaker 2>they're hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper organized and it's an even then </v>

508
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.721
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for them to manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're juggling know four or </v>

509
00:30:33.721 --> 00:30:37.471
<v Speaker 2>five impossible things at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and often also guilt ridden because </v>

510
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:42.151
<v Speaker 2>they're not to feel that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying enough attention to their </v>

511
00:30:42.151 --> 00:30:44.821
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally they are and they make very </v>

512
00:30:44.821 --> 00:30:47.540
<v Speaker 2>good role models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a hell of a thing to expect of </v>

513
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.360
<v Speaker 2>someone who also has a maternal role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious that it's even that </v>

514
00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 2>it's even possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing we can't have a</v>

515
00:30:55.181 --> 00:31:00.181
<v Speaker 2>serious conversation about because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of lies I would say </v>

516
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:04.381
<v Speaker 2>about how it's the glass ceiling or were</v>
<v Speaker 2>male models of success that are stopping</v>

517
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:08.500
<v Speaker 2>women from succeeding at that high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

518
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

519
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 2>what stops people from succeeding at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that high level is it's virtually </v>

520
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.051
<v Speaker 2>impossible to begin with and all you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need more impediment and then you can't </v>

521
00:31:19.051 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 2>manage it.</v>

522
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

523
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Can we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parlier has said that feminism has never</v>

524
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.320
<v Speaker 3>acknowledged the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guilt that women feel when they all </v>

525
00:31:30.991 --> 00:31:35.991
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have children and they are </v>

526
00:31:35.991 --> 00:31:36.000
<v Speaker 3>working and they pursue their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

527
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:41.001
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it at work places where I've </v>

528
00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:42.840
<v Speaker 3>worked where women are high achieving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high achieving,</v>

529
00:31:42.841 --> 00:31:47.841
<v Speaker 3>they've got their phds and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working full time and they are racked </v>

530
00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:52.431
<v Speaker 3>with guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that happens to men </v>

531
00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:54.670
<v Speaker 3>nearly to the same degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

532
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 2>don't think it happens to me really at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

533
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

534
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been to my observation that it</v>

535
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 2>happens to man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to women all the time,</v>

536
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.570
<v Speaker 2>like all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>

537
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I've done an awful lot of coaching with </v>
<v Speaker 2>high achieving women.</v>

538
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I did that for about 10 years and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

539
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 2>these were women who were pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>outstanding and in multiple dimensions,</v>

540
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

541
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what would also,</v>

542
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:23.701
<v Speaker 2>this was mostly in the field of law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so most of them are in their early </v>

543
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 2>thirties and not only were they racked </v>
<v Speaker 2>with guilt if they have children and </v>

544
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 2>we're spending as much time as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted with them,</v>

545
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but they were also wracked with guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they did spend time with your </v>

546
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.510
<v Speaker 2>children because then they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending enough time on their career and</v>

547
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.020
<v Speaker 2>basically screwed both ways and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't merely</v>

548
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.220
<v Speaker 2>a matter of let's say high negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional sensitivity,</v>

549
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that is a biological difference </v>

550
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.441
<v Speaker 2>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I would say some of the women </v>

551
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that I coached were quite feminine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're more prone to anxiety.</v>

552
00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:57.471
<v Speaker 2>Then might've been good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was merely a response to what's </v>

553
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:00.720
<v Speaker 2>essentially an impossible situation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

554
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's also not something that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an easy answer to,</v>

555
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I would recommend to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that they outsource all of the </v>

556
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.921
<v Speaker 2>domestic duties they could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage and most of the successful women </v>

557
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:13.110
<v Speaker 2>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had nannies,</v>

558
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 2>they outsourced everything they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including their laundry and like they,</v>

559
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:22.451
<v Speaker 2>they try to rid themselves of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic duties that could be parceled </v>

560
00:33:22.711 --> 00:33:25.320
<v Speaker 2>out to a third party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a pretty,</v>

561
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.520
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not optional if you want to pursue </v>

562
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.411
<v Speaker 2>a career at a higher level but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires a pretty high standard of </v>

563
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:37.161
<v Speaker 2>living to be able to pull that off </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not like childcare of any </v>

564
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:41.481
<v Speaker 2>quality is extremely expensive and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to bring that cost down </v>

565
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:46.080
<v Speaker 2>because with young children you need a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very high ratio of caregiver to child,</v>

566
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.030
<v Speaker 2>like three to one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to one.</v>

567
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you have someone who's even </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaguely qualified and you pay them,</v>

568
00:33:51.661 --> 00:33:53.700
<v Speaker 2>say $40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

569
00:33:53.701 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>double that for overhead.</v>

570
00:33:56.281 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's 80,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just the bare minimum cost of,</v>

571
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>of the highest quality of croissant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional care for children is </v>

572
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.321
<v Speaker 2>easily $20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>per child per year and there's no easy </v>

573
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.260
<v Speaker 2>way of forcing that costs down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

574
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>The arithmetic is very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a major societal problem and it </v>

575
00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:21.111
<v Speaker 2>isn't clear that at an end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's unfortunate is that we're not </v>

576
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:23.220
<v Speaker 2>having serious conversations about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we pretend that the barriers are</v>

577
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.060
<v Speaker 2>what the consequences of something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal oppression or,</v>

578
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.750
<v Speaker 2>or straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

579
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:32.760
<v Speaker 2>prejudice against women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just simply not the case.</v>

580
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 3>The irony is that to make things easier </v>
<v Speaker 3>for professional middle class </v>

581
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.091
<v Speaker 3>professional women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need more working class women who </v>

582
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:47.391
<v Speaker 3>can do cleaning and nannying work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you get to,</v>

583
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 3>to make life easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a,</v>

584
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 3>a cohort of lowly paid women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think would help the </v>

585
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.260
<v Speaker 3>gender gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

586
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 3>To have two tiers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another highly paid women and </v>

587
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

588
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.350
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another under discussed,</v>

589
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.470
<v Speaker 2>under discussed topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you,</v>

590
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you ended up transferring the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

591
00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:18.780
<v Speaker 2>maternal burden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic burden onto generally.</v>

592
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're generally a ethnic minority </v>

593
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.901
<v Speaker 2>people that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common and I mean it's not </v>

594
00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:30.261
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a bad bargain for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm given their comparative options,</v>

595
00:35:30.571 --> 00:35:35.571
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's very difficult to pay someone </v>

596
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 2>who's doing domestic work enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

597
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.320
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable standard of living because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

598
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 2>partly because it's just so expensive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do so.</v>

599
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an intransigent problem to say the </v>

600
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.281
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would be nice if we could </v>

601
00:35:52.281 --> 00:35:52.770
<v Speaker 2>actually have a serious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate discussion about it.</v>

602
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think the compassion part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

603
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.990
<v Speaker 2>is to actually take a harsh look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

604
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at such factors as the biological clock,</v>

605
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:08.720
<v Speaker 2>which certainly make women's lives much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complicated up until their,</v>

606
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.080
<v Speaker 2>let's say till their forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

607
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that men might have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated lives in the latter part of </v>

608
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.791
<v Speaker 2>their life because of course we die </v>
<v Speaker 2>about eight years earlier in our health </v>

609
00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 2>problems or are more extreme and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

610
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:25.461
<v Speaker 2>But I think that men's situation in life</v>
<v Speaker 2>is somewhat simpler than women,</v>

611
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>certainly up to the age of about 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

612
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:34.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's unfortunate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't address that squarely and </v>

613
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:39.351
<v Speaker 2>start to figure out what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's a simple thing because </v>

614
00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:39.351
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not</v>

615
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some places do better than others.</v>

616
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in Holland or the.</v>

617
00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in some of the Scandinavian </v>

618
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.861
<v Speaker 3>countries there are many women work part</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and that's found to be quite </v>

619
00:36:57.101 --> 00:37:01.120
<v Speaker 3>productive for their economy and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are happy working part time.</v>

620
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

621
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:08.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some societies are a little bit </v>

622
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.390
<v Speaker 3>more progressive in answering some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these questions.</v>

623
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.620
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

624
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.660
<v Speaker 3>there's still this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if any Western culture is,</v>

625
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has many honest conversations about </v>

626
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.350
<v Speaker 3>biological sex differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

627
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 3>we don't have it in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like you have it in </v>

628
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.231
<v Speaker 3>Canada or America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it happens in the </v>

629
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:31.231
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian countries.</v>

630
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any evidence that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

631
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:38.450
<v Speaker 2>the Scandinavians are always concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's over representation of men </v>

632
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the stem fields,</v>

633
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:41.040
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in engineering,</v>

634
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.520
<v Speaker 2>even though we're thinking that doubt is</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty clear that the idea that men are </v>

635
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.121
<v Speaker 2>more interested in things and women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more interested in people is pretty </v>

636
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 2>robust finding and the differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't small either.</v>

637
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the biological difference,</v>

638
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:58.881
<v Speaker 2>let her choose be quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think quite productive because </v>

639
00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:01.941
<v Speaker 2>basically what it's indicated is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there doesn't seem to be really much </v>

640
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 2>difference in men and women with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to intellectual ability.</v>

641
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 2>The mean Iq is it's pretty much dead on </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same.</v>

642
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Now there is a little debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the standard deviation is the </v>

643
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.310
<v Speaker 2>same with some evidence suggesting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men have a flatter standard deviation,</v>

644
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:22.311
<v Speaker 2>so there's more hyper geniuses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more men who are intellectually </v>

645
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 2>impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly more men who were </v>

646
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.081
<v Speaker 2>intellectually impaired on the learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>disability end of this distribution for </v>

647
00:38:30.081 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But and you know,</v>

648
00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:37.131
<v Speaker 2>even small differences in standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation can make huge differences out </v>

649
00:38:37.131 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 2>at the ends of the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

650
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 2>But I would say the evidence for that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed.</v>

651
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not conclusive evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in personality I think is </v>

652
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.251
<v Speaker 2>absolutely conclusive and the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>for difference in interest is even more </v>

653
00:38:50.251 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 2>conclusive to the effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sizes are really large</v>

654
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:57.810
<v Speaker 3>and what is really interesting is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sex differences in personality </v>

655
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:02.611
<v Speaker 3>become larger in ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian countries.</v>

656
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's scandalous is what that is </v>

657
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 2>because it's announced disproof of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social constructionist theory and it's </v>

658
00:39:11.031 --> 00:39:16.031
<v Speaker 2>very solid science despite the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's some of the material that </v>

659
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:17.990
<v Speaker 2>changed to more referred to in his memo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very solid science.</v>

660
00:39:17.991 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>From a social science perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

661
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's at the point where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in controvertible precisely,</v>

662
00:39:25.251 --> 00:39:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's about as close as you get in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social sciences.</v>

663
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

664
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.150
<v Speaker 3>David Schmidt was the lead author on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that study,</v>

665
00:39:33.151 --> 00:39:38.151
<v Speaker 3>I believe on the finding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality differences increase in </v>

666
00:39:38.581 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Gender Galitary in countries and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's.</v>

667
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.310
<v Speaker 3>What I find interesting is he's finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>that women become more neurotic and more</v>

668
00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:50.970
<v Speaker 3>anxious in more free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.920
<v Speaker 3>gender egalitarian or or countries that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have more freedom.</v>

670
00:39:55.010 --> 00:40:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really interesting in it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it speaks to some it.</v>

671
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.770
<v Speaker 3>It suggests that there must be some kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of biological underpinning for anxiety </v>

672
00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 3>in women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sex difference in anxiety.</v>

673
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we we should never assume that freedom </v>

674
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 2>is something that brings security </v>
<v Speaker 2>because freedom opens unexpensive domain</v>

675
00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.900
<v Speaker 2>up in front of you and that's full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

676
00:40:23.901 --> 00:40:28.901
<v Speaker 2>but but if we think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty or or the unexpected or </v>

677
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:33.371
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then know your primary response to </v>

678
00:40:33.371 --> 00:40:35.930
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if the territory is vast,</v>

679
00:40:35.931 --> 00:40:40.931
<v Speaker 2>is initially paralysis and fear and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in in the mythology the hero,</v>

680
00:40:42.261 --> 00:40:45.890
<v Speaker 2>which is the archetypal story of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation with the unexplored.</v>

681
00:40:45.891 --> 00:40:50.891
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common for the hero to take flight </v>

682
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:51.290
<v Speaker 2>at the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the first appearance of the,</v>

683
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.670
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

684
00:40:52.671 --> 00:40:57.671
<v Speaker 2>of the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good way of thinking about it </v>

685
00:40:57.671 --> 00:40:58.940
<v Speaker 2>architecturally because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that expanse is very.</v>

686
00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

687
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:05.110
<v Speaker 2>it's unsettled in the technical sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the monsters are,</v>

688
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:10.630
<v Speaker 2>and so we should never make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption that more freedom means more </v>

689
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.491
<v Speaker 2>happiness and know the literature on </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness is quite interesting because </v>

690
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:17.180
<v Speaker 2>it's actually not a literature on </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

691
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a literature on the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety because it isn't that people </v>

692
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:27.311
<v Speaker 2>want to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that they don't want to be </v>

693
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:29.420
<v Speaker 2>miserable and anxious because those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically separate systems.</v>

694
00:41:29.421 --> 00:41:31.520
<v Speaker 2>One governance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say extroversion,</v>

695
00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>that's the approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive system than the other,</v>

696
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:35.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governs.</v>

697
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm freezing you pray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pray like freezing.</v>

698
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:45.341
<v Speaker 2>And then retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly what we want to do is keep </v>

699
00:41:45.341 --> 00:41:48.701
<v Speaker 2>the prey like response and the retreat </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems under control because they're </v>

700
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 2>unbearable when they're activated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

701
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.310
<v Speaker 2>and there's just no reason at all to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume either that freedom or even </v>

702
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 2>economic advantage is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing.</v>

703
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that people in </v>

704
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.160
<v Speaker 2>industrialized countries are happier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than people in non industrialized </v>

705
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.401
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though their standard of living is </v>

706
00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 2>much higher and they live much longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're more disease free.</v>

707
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And I think a big part of the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it takes a tremendous amount of </v>

708
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:23.291
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice in work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's future oriented in order to keep </v>

709
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:25.400
<v Speaker 2>the society with a high standard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>living functioning.</v>

710
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.400
<v Speaker 2>And so you're constantly sacrificing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasures of the moment to the security </v>

711
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 2>of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

712
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a major moral and emotional load </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the reasons for it are </v>

713
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:44.141
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't simply boil down to </v>

714
00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:44.450
<v Speaker 2>something like freedom from anxiety or </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness,</v>

715
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a high pressure job,</v>

716
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.900
<v Speaker 2>well you have a high pressure job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have responsibilities and if you </v>

717
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.100
<v Speaker 2>screw up major things happened with </v>
<v Speaker 2>major consequences and that's,</v>

718
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 2>that's also a tremendous burden even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though you can be well paid for it.</v>

719
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we studied some,</v>

720
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.600
<v Speaker 2>some workers in a factory in Wisconsin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were doing testing that would </v>

721
00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:16.451
<v Speaker 2>help identify promising workers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be streamed into a management </v>

722
00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

723
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 2>we found about a third of them didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take the tests.</v>

724
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And when we investigated that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason was,</v>

725
00:43:22.221 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 2>well they wanted to work nine to five in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bounded manner.</v>

726
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.200
<v Speaker 2>So then they went home at night at 5:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were done their damn job and they </v>

727
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.151
<v Speaker 2>could have their life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about professional level jobs </v>

728
00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:38.900
<v Speaker 2>is that complex jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managerial jobs,</v>

729
00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:43.901
<v Speaker 2>complex administrative jobs or jobs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science or any of the professions is </v>

730
00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that you're never not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

731
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 2>So if you add to that the complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>

732
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:55.121
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got things to worry about that </v>

733
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:57.851
<v Speaker 2>are significant or the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're also higher insulin </v>

734
00:43:57.851 --> 00:44:00.790
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity to negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very stressful and,</v>

735
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and genuinely so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

736
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>well that's the price you pay and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a trivial price.</v>

737
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.650
<v Speaker 2>So back to Queensland for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you tell me a little bit about its </v>

738
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:20.261
<v Speaker 2>reach and scope and about it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetization if you don't have to get </v>

739
00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:24.911
<v Speaker 2>into the details but people might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in trying to figure out how </v>

740
00:44:24.911 --> 00:44:24.911
<v Speaker 2>you manage that.</v>

741
00:44:24.911 --> 00:44:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for the first year that I was running</v>

742
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:30.790
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was self funded.</v>

743
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't collecting any revenue through </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertising or patronage.</v>

744
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

745
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I funded it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my costs were very low.</v>

746
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't cost a whole lot to run a </v>
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>

747
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 3>I had minimal infrastructure at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

748
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I now have a more robust infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 3>which costs more.</v>

749
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 3>I pay professional freelance writers </v>
<v Speaker 3>fee,</v>

750
00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 3>but academics who work for me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were already salaried,</v>

751
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

752
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did some pro bono writing and that </v>

753
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 3>was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

754
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 3>so for the first year I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bootstrapped it in,</v>

755
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:16.581
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I funded it myself and then last </v>

756
00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:21.260
<v Speaker 3>year I set up a patrion page and for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while I was um,</v>

757
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.100
<v Speaker 3>getting enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just enough to cover costs and a little </v>

758
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.091
<v Speaker 3>bit to pay writers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I put advertising on the </v>

759
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:35.220
<v Speaker 3>website and I was earning a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit through that.</v>

760
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:40.550
<v Speaker 3>But the earnings are quite modest and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>patronage has recently been bumped up </v>

761
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:47.631
<v Speaker 3>because we published quite a popular </v>
<v Speaker 3>article about the Google memo before </v>

762
00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:55.461
<v Speaker 3>James was set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had reached out to for scientists when</v>

763
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.290
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Miller lead,</v>

764
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social psychologist,</v>

765
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Deborah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Canadian six Rasha and David </v>

766
00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the author of that I'm famous </v>

767
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 3>study and I got them to write a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of paragraphs on what they thought about</v>

768
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:19.521
<v Speaker 3>the Google memo and I've published that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just as the news broke that he was quiet</v>

769
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.820
<v Speaker 3>and so that kind of went viral and site </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed.</v>

770
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 3>And so we got a lot of attention for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in our patronage.</v>

771
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Has since doubled for that article was </v>
<v Speaker 3>published.</v>

772
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:39.831
<v Speaker 3>We were getting around between 10 and 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 20,000</v>

773
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:42.980
<v Speaker 3>visitors a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

774
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 3>and now it's between 15 and $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day.</v>

775
00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:52.291
<v Speaker 3>So we get quite a lot of traffic and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be making more money through </v>

776
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 3>advertising.</v>

777
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.100
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said it slows down the webpage and </v>

778
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:02.690
<v Speaker 3>there's this trade off between having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>website that looks nice and is </v>

779
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:09.380
<v Speaker 3>reasonably fast and one that is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>loaded with ugly ads any slow and </v>

780
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:16.401
<v Speaker 3>clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I've decided that I'm just going </v>

781
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:19.941
<v Speaker 3>to focus on the patronage business model</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get rid of the ads and,</v>

782
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 3>and just focus on pleasing the patrons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

783
00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.720
<v Speaker 3>and I think patronage is the better </v>
<v Speaker 3>model to go with anyway because you </v>

784
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 3>don't have to worry about how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>clicks or views an article gets.</v>

785
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Just have to focus on the quality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>patrons will reward you for quality,</v>

786
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:38.630
<v Speaker 3>not for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

787
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.580
<v Speaker 3>how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

788
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

789
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other advantage to patronage is that</v>

790
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you're a lot more immune from political </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure and demonetization,</v>

791
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>which is increasingly a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously advertisers have the </v>

792
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.571
<v Speaker 2>right to advertise wherever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly on youtube that's become </v>

793
00:47:57.571 --> 00:48:01.800
<v Speaker 2>an emergent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many problems on youtube </v>

794
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.100
<v Speaker 2>including censorship from within youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself and the construction of these </v>

795
00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>like artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice parts that they're </v>

796
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.961
<v Speaker 2>producing like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the demonetization issue is a real </v>

797
00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:17.971
<v Speaker 2>problem for anybody that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain any sort of journalistic </v>

798
00:48:17.971 --> 00:48:21.031
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know lots of people like Dave </v>

799
00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:21.031
<v Speaker 2>Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

800
00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 2>the speed hit really hard by </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonetization.</v>

801
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 2>So the patronage model seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

802
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Seems to be a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

803
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.640
<v Speaker 2>how much revenue are you generating with</v>
<v Speaker 2>patron at the moment,</v>

804
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind me asking?</v>

805
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000 us a month.</v>

806
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with any luck it'll continue to grow.</v>

807
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 2>We'll definitely put a link to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your patron accountant in the </v>

808
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.140
<v Speaker 2>description of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this interview,</v>

809
00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:50.141
<v Speaker 2>and I would certainly encourage people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are watching to to support Claire </v>

810
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Because Colette is really quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable accomplishment and it's </v>

811
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 2>exactly the kind of journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's reminds me kind of what the </v>

812
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.551
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic monthly used to be like before </v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a nosedive into political </v>

813
00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:03.020
<v Speaker 2>correctness over the last I think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>

814
00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.260
<v Speaker 2>It's something that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afflicting so many journalistic sources </v>

815
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 2>or even see it as something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterizing the economist,</v>

816
00:49:09.081 --> 00:49:14.081
<v Speaker 2>which was a magazine that seemed pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of that sort of thing for </v>

817
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:14.081
<v Speaker 2>quite a while</v>

818
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 3>and the new republic used to be at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great best unit of classical liberalism </v>

819
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:25.690
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Western civilization and now it's.</v>

820
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:32.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the most regressive postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the new republic is unreadable.</v>

821
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that magazine.</v>

822
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as familiar with it as the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that I listed,</v>

823
00:49:41.121 --> 00:49:43.550
<v Speaker 2>but I've noticed the same thing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

824
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that's interesting,</v>

825
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:52.650
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the reason that I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with the pathology of the </v>

826
00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:55.490
<v Speaker 2>universities is because it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sounds conspiratorial,</v>

827
00:49:55.491 --> 00:49:59.450
<v Speaker 2>but I'm afraid I'm still going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss it to the really serious,</v>

828
00:49:59.451 --> 00:50:02.240
<v Speaker 2>postmodern new Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disciplines like women's studies,</v>

829
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:03.260
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

830
00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:06.530
<v Speaker 2>very good at producing activists who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

831
00:50:06.531 --> 00:50:11.531
<v Speaker 2>very good at occupying mid-level </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic positions and dominating </v>

832
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.060
<v Speaker 2>relevant institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

833
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's happened in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the province I live in in Ontario this </v>

834
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.230
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the Ontario Law Society has now </v>

835
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.841
<v Speaker 2>made it mandatory for lawyers to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with a statement on diversity and </v>

836
00:50:25.841 --> 00:50:30.431
<v Speaker 2>equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to do that part of their </v>

837
00:50:30.431 --> 00:50:32.501
<v Speaker 2>practice and they basically have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>admit to white privilege Andy and </v>

838
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 2>systemic racism within the profession.</v>

839
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Despite the fact that their own damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>data indicate,</v>

840
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:43.421
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Asians are overrepresented in the </v>

841
00:50:43.421 --> 00:50:46.091
<v Speaker 2>legal profession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I know that the whole idea is if </v>

842
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 2>you have a theory and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>data point that invalidates the theory,</v>

843
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 2>that's a reliable data point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your theory is wrong.</v>

844
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:58.060
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that the white dominated </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal profession actually promotes </v>

845
00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.681
<v Speaker 2>Asians at a rate that exceeds what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would expect by a population and that </v>

846
00:51:02.681 --> 00:51:05.660
<v Speaker 2>was just absolutely invalidates the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of systemic racism,</v>

847
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.260
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>society's been taken over by a small </v>

848
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.830
<v Speaker 2>coterie of extraordinarily dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern activists and the,</v>

849
00:51:14.831 --> 00:51:19.831
<v Speaker 2>the amount they care for facts zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>since they don't even believe in the </v>

850
00:51:19.831 --> 00:51:20.720
<v Speaker 2>existence of factories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

851
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.030
<v Speaker 3>we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had the same thing happened to the</v>

852
00:51:24.031 --> 00:51:27.180
<v Speaker 3>law society in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

853
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.770
<v Speaker 3>my husband's a lawyer and he brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>home the Law Society magazine.</v>

854
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 3>And on the front cover was an article </v>
<v Speaker 3>about unconscious bias training and how </v>

855
00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:42.210
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be mandatory for all </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers in Australia.</v>

856
00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I sent off a couple of emails to </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists I know who do research in </v>

857
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.041
<v Speaker 3>this area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one got back to me saying there is </v>

858
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:55.650
<v Speaker 3>no data there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no Meta analysis and there are</v>

859
00:51:55.651 --> 00:52:00.651
<v Speaker 3>no randomized controlled trials that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show that unconscious bias training has </v>

860
00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:06.651
<v Speaker 3>any effect after a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it might have an initial effect on </v>

861
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:10.770
<v Speaker 3>people when they're doing a pencil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper survey.</v>

862
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 3>But after a couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all gone and there's no long term</v>

863
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:20.250
<v Speaker 3>effect on any measurable outcomes in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>workplace.</v>

864
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.580
<v Speaker 3>So there's no shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complete scam.</v>

865
00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

866
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Stem</v>

867
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 2>and it is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

868
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implicit association test of course,</v>

869
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:34.811
<v Speaker 2>which is being pushed by people who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very explicit radical left when you </v>

870
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:39.971
<v Speaker 2>gender by the way because measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now she is known quite well for </v>

871
00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been absolutely misused.</v>

872
00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Like the relationship between so-called </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit bias and and categorization </v>

873
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:51.311
<v Speaker 2>isn't well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand the relationship </v>

874
00:52:51.311 --> 00:52:54.521
<v Speaker 2>between implicit bias and the kind of in</v>
<v Speaker 2>group preference that makes you love </v>

875
00:52:54.521 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>your own family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

876
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.130
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 2>equally distributing your care across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire expanse of 7 billion people,</v>

878
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>7 billion people that make up the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

879
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:07.660
<v Speaker 2>which of course you just simply can't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

880
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Behavioral effects of that implicit a s </v>
<v Speaker 2>a categorization,</v>

881
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:17.201
<v Speaker 2>let's call it rather than bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't well understood and there's no </v>

882
00:53:17.201 --> 00:53:20.321
<v Speaker 2>evidence whatsoever that unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>bias retraining programs do anything </v>

883
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:24.430
<v Speaker 2>that's positive whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet it's being pushed especially and</v>

884
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:29.440
<v Speaker 2>being made mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all sorts of levels of corporations </v>

885
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't understand why the lawyers,</v>

886
00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up with this.</v>

887
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're being accused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be,</v>

888
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.360
<v Speaker 2>there'll be accused of guilt before </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence,</v>

889
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:41.450
<v Speaker 2>which is all a bunch of racists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're being accused in the most </v>

890
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 2>appalling way because they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's even unconscious.</v>

892
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 2>They're going after the know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their targets,</v>

893
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 2>unconscious perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so totalitarian that it.</v>

894
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:55.970
<v Speaker 2>If it isn't even something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody associates could have thought </v>

895
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.970
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

896
00:53:55.970 --> 00:54:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Legal profession as far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relies on the reasonable person standard</v>

897
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:07.630
<v Speaker 3>and the practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lawyers and judges are supposed to be</v>

898
00:54:08.181 --> 00:54:11.810
<v Speaker 3>free of bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

899
00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:14.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

900
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:19.310
<v Speaker 3>if your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are in trouble with the law and </v>

901
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:22.811
<v Speaker 3>you go to a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's biased toward or she's biased </v>

902
00:54:22.811 --> 00:54:24.560
<v Speaker 3>towards you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

903
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:29.650
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the legal professionals are now </v>

904
00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:32.270
<v Speaker 3>saying that their lawyers are inherently</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist and sexist,</v>

905
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean that undermines the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>profession.</v>

906
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also say that that's actually </v>

907
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the reason that this is being done is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>undermine the entire profession.</v>

908
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Because the Meta story behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern and Neo Marxist activists is </v>

909
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:51.981
<v Speaker 2>that everything about Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is corrupt and oppressive </v>

910
00:54:51.981 --> 00:54:55.161
<v Speaker 2>and should be taken down to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stripped down to its roots and </v>

911
00:54:55.161 --> 00:54:58.911
<v Speaker 2>rebuilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the fact that the implicit </v>

912
00:54:58.911 --> 00:55:01.851
<v Speaker 2>messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you can't trust the legal </v>

913
00:55:01.851 --> 00:55:03.681
<v Speaker 2>profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no problem for the people who are </v>

914
00:55:03.681 --> 00:55:03.681
<v Speaker 2>doing that because that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think.</v>

915
00:55:03.681 --> 00:55:08.000
<v Speaker 2>They think the entire editors of Western</v>
<v Speaker 2>law is nothing but a oppressive </v>

916
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.871
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so appallingly backwards that </v>

917
00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 2>it's almost beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

918
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I suppose compared to their utopians </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

919
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:21.230
<v Speaker 2>it's an oppressive structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but compared to every other system in </v>

920
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.690
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it operates like a charm.</v>

921
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the view of the,</v>

922
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.440
<v Speaker 3>the postmodernists and the activist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that I think there are </v>

923
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.931
<v Speaker 3>sensible people who aren't familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism that go along with this </v>

924
00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:39.221
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I see corporations and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

925
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.260
<v Speaker 3>the legal society is implementing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious bias training.</v>

926
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it has to do with </v>

927
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.900
<v Speaker 3>mitigating the risk of lawsuits and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they do get a lawsuit,</v>

928
00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:55.540
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone wants to see a female </v>

929
00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.901
<v Speaker 3>employee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was to sue them for gender </v>

930
00:55:58.901 --> 00:55:58.901
<v Speaker 3>discrimination in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can say,</v>

931
00:55:58.901 --> 00:55:59.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we've,</v>

932
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.140
<v Speaker 3>we've had this bias training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to do the right thing.</v>

933
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.790
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google have been google,</v>

934
00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:11.090
<v Speaker 3>now I have a class action lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 3>against them.</v>

935
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a handful of female employees are suing </v>

936
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.981
<v Speaker 3>them for Jenna discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that there is systematic </v>

937
00:56:20.981 --> 00:56:24.551
<v Speaker 3>gender discrimination because they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid less and some male engineers that </v>

938
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 3>were hired at the same time that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were and were promoted more quickly.</v>

939
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of this,</v>

940
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.020
<v Speaker 3>these policies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

941
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 3>companies and corporations just trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cover their backside when it comes to</v>

942
00:56:40.781 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 3>threaten legal action.</v>

943
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

944
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's driven than the United </v>

945
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:51.560
<v Speaker 2>States by legislation like title nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's held over,</v>

946
00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:56.800
<v Speaker 2>especially in educational institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is primarily applies that's held </v>

947
00:56:57.531 --> 00:56:59.730
<v Speaker 2>over their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sword of Damocles and,</v>

948
00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's been tremendously damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is for the corporations </v>

949
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:09.161
<v Speaker 2>is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're chasing away a small table and </v>

950
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:10.220
<v Speaker 2>letting a way bigger devil in at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

951
00:57:10.221 --> 00:57:12.680
<v Speaker 2>And so as a short term solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

952
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 2>it's somewhat acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by participating in these mandatory </v>

953
00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:21.500
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias retraining processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do two things.</v>

954
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.690
<v Speaker 2>The first thing they do is admit their </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>

955
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Practically pragmatically speaking,</v>

956
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive mistake to let someone </v>

957
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.201
<v Speaker 2>accused you of unconscious systematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias and then to allow </v>

958
00:57:35.271 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 2>yourself to be retrained because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically admitting guilt.</v>

959
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 2>And I can't see that that's going to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on a stronger legal ground moving </v>

960
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

961
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Because by saying what we need this </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

962
00:57:47.031 --> 00:57:52.031
<v Speaker 2>you're admitting that the problem exists</v>
<v Speaker 2>at precisely the level that it's being </v>

963
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:52.040
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

964
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:57.041
<v Speaker 2>my experience especially with say with </v>
<v Speaker 2>large law firms is that they're so </v>

965
00:57:57.051 --> 00:58:02.051
<v Speaker 2>goddamn desperate for talent that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do everything they possibly can say to </v>

966
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:06.230
<v Speaker 2>retain their women over backwards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie themselves into knots.</v>

967
00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have a female high </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing team,</v>

968
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:13.951
<v Speaker 2>male lawyer who's also capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>generating revenue in those people are </v>

969
00:58:13.951 --> 00:58:14.760
<v Speaker 2>incredibly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

970
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict between the men and women in </v>

971
00:58:20.361 --> 00:58:25.361
<v Speaker 2>the law firms at an individual level </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the other thing that you see </v>

972
00:58:25.361 --> 00:58:30.011
<v Speaker 2>happening in high achieving professions </v>
<v Speaker 2>among high achieving people is that </v>

973
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:31.130
<v Speaker 2>there were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very competitive.</v>

974
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.640
<v Speaker 2>And I've certainly seen like I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>many women in my,</v>

975
00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:36.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my coaching practice,</v>

976
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:41.411
<v Speaker 2>let's say who were under constant stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the men in their immediate </v>

977
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:43.070
<v Speaker 2>environment wouldn't cooperate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

978
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my point always was,</v>

979
00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:51.550
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not surprising that these men </v>

980
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:51.920
<v Speaker 2>aren't cooperating with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a threat,</v>

981
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you're very good at what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

982
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.420
<v Speaker 2>they're not only trying to be good </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers,</v>

983
00:58:56.450 --> 00:59:00.890
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to win and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doing the winning.</v>

984
00:59:00.891 --> 00:59:04.640
<v Speaker 2>And so they're not going to help you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the objection of the women generally who</v>

985
00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.500
<v Speaker 2>were agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women say no.</v>

986
00:59:06.501 --> 00:59:08.600
<v Speaker 2>So more on the feminine end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum was,</v>

987
00:59:08.601 --> 00:59:09.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all on the same team,</v>

988
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.990
<v Speaker 2>same team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be pulling together.</v>

989
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

990
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.070
<v Speaker 2>that isn't exactly how competitive men </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

991
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Is that partly they're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the primary characteristic of a</v>

992
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 2>high achieving lawyers as well as high </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbal intelligence,</v>

993
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 2>but they also tend to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable,</v>

994
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:31.790
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're litigators and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're disagreeable because </v>

995
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:33.940
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be litigators otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>just scribbled.</v>

996
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Men are competitive and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

997
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's another thing that we will talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the camp talk about is how in the </v>

998
00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.461
<v Speaker 2>world men are supposed to compete with </v>
<v Speaker 2>women because men don't know how to </v>

999
00:59:45.461 --> 00:59:47.090
<v Speaker 2>compete with women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winning is,</v>

1000
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:52.180
<v Speaker 2>is preferable to losing let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also tends to make you into </v>

1001
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:57.701
<v Speaker 2>something of a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem in competitive </v>

1002
00:59:57.701 --> 01:00:01.451
<v Speaker 2>environments because the competition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually part of what drives the </v>

1003
01:00:01.451 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1004
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also on an Nada,</v>

1005
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 2>not a straightforward thing to sort out </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

1006
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know exactly what we're </v>

1007
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>going to do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1008
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 2>so some of what's regarded as say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice against women.</v>

1009
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Some of that can be nearly attributed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that men are competitive and </v>

1010
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they treat each other harshly as well.</v>

1011
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if it's limited to there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1012
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:32.261
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know perfectly well that it's </v>

1013
01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:32.261
<v Speaker 2>essentially mitigated in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1014
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Men are harsher with each other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are with women even though they can</v>

1015
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>be perfectly plenty horse with women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1016
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:44.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of what's accepted as </v>

1017
01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:44.050
<v Speaker 2>normative in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1018
01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:47.040
<v Speaker 2>in primarily male situations show.</v>

1019
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

1020
01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:53.881
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different kind of middling or you</v>

1021
01:00:54.581 --> 01:00:54.870
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1022
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:56.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the casual insults.</v>

1023
01:00:56.551 --> 01:01:01.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean that it's not taken as offensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>often email only groups.</v>

1024
01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:04.230
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a way of bonding.</v>

1025
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1026
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.200
<v Speaker 2>It's also part of the mutual testing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes on because one of the things </v>

1027
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:14.570
<v Speaker 2>you want to find out from a new work </v>
<v Speaker 2>crew member,</v>

1028
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really saw this when I was working</v>

1029
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:18.860
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in working class situations,</v>

1030
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

1031
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1032
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.590
<v Speaker 2>harass the hell out of them for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weeks.</v>

1033
01:01:24.591 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them down,</v>

1034
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>give them nicknames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make fun of them.</v>

1035
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:34.030
<v Speaker 2>And a huge part of the reason you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that is to see if they have the </v>

1036
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.061
<v Speaker 2>kind of emotional and psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity that would indicate that they </v>

1037
01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 2>could take a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can give a take,</v>

1038
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.200
<v Speaker 2>they can stand some competition and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to,</v>

1039
01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:46.590
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to shirk and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to fail in a crisis and men </v>

1040
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 2>are good at doing that with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's harder to do that with women.</v>

1041
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious exactly how you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1042
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it can be managed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1043
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing.</v>

1044
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think part of the reason too </v>

1045
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.121
<v Speaker 2>that men are bailing out of so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>university disciplines is because they </v>

1046
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:10.391
<v Speaker 2>also don't know how to manage the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment when it becomes female </v>

1047
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:14.501
<v Speaker 2>dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not exactly sure what the rules </v>

1048
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>of engagement are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I respect my,</v>

1049
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.900
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my attitude is something like no holds </v>

1050
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 2>barred and let the devil take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hindmost.</v>

1051
01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1052
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And I can be as harsh and blunt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward as I want to be in a </v>

1053
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:32.661
<v Speaker 2>situation like that and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rules aren't the same when </v>

1054
01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 2>dealing with women and it isn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1055
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:39.441
<v Speaker 2>I know what the rules are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know that they're not the same </v>

1056
01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's quite confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:45.621
<v Speaker 2>like my TV appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my producers is always cautioned </v>

1058
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:50.631
<v Speaker 2>me about panels that are mixed sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1059
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said it's very bad for him on </v>

1060
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.400
<v Speaker 2>television to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on the attack in a mixed sex panel</v>

1061
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.810
<v Speaker 2>because you come across as a bully.</v>

1062
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1063
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1064
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>

1065
01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:09.050
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't know what to do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it seems like,</v>

1066
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.940
<v Speaker 2>like pulling my punches so to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like seems necessary but also </v>

1067
01:03:15.971 --> 01:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>oddly inappropriate.</v>

1068
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1069
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 2>It puts me at a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1070
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how to manage it.</v>

1071
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1072
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those,</v>

1073
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:31.490
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the situations where there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of variation among women and um,</v>

1074
01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any.</v>

1075
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:37.281
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know anything more about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person other than the fact that they're </v>

1076
01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:39.260
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know if they're on the sort of</v>

1077
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:43.520
<v Speaker 3>male typical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more masculine or they're on the</v>

1078
01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.370
<v Speaker 3>highly agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1079
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.720
<v Speaker 3>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1080
01:03:46.721 --> 01:03:48.650
<v Speaker 3>you don't know anything about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

1081
01:03:48.651 --> 01:03:51.850
<v Speaker 3>so you don't know if they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to handle that given.</v>

1082
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing that I find really interesting</v>

1083
01:03:55.131 --> 01:04:00.131
<v Speaker 3>is that we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know quite a lot about male </v>

1084
01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:01.370
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't.</v>

1085
01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.850
<v Speaker 3>We haven't studied female competition a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great deal.</v>

1086
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 3>I know that some evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists have been studying it like</v>

1087
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:12.140
<v Speaker 3>an capital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1088
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:17.350
<v Speaker 3>women compete with each other as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>and women have their own forms of </v>

1089
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:17.350
<v Speaker 3>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's all,</v>

1090
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

1091
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not spoken about much white </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

1092
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't even in the workplace,</v>

1093
01:04:25.311 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 3>women compete with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1094
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.600
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's it.</v>

1095
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:30.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1096
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women might come up against hostile or </v>

1097
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.560
<v Speaker 3>hyper competitive men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but women come up against other women as</v>

1098
01:04:36.561 --> 01:04:37.210
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1099
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:42.830
<v Speaker 3>and it could be the case that a younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>women and not what one speculation or </v>

1100
01:04:46.071 --> 01:04:51.071
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis that I've had is that younger</v>
<v Speaker 3>women don't always find it easier to </v>

1101
01:04:52.101 --> 01:04:56.750
<v Speaker 3>work with older women because there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition there and hostility.</v>

1102
01:04:56.751 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1103
01:04:56.950 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 2>there is evidence that women are happier</v>
<v Speaker 2>with male bosses than with female </v>

1104
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>

1105
01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:09.120
<v Speaker 2>your observation about us not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the competitive landscape </v>

1106
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.081
<v Speaker 2>is spot on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand the male dominance </v>

1107
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:16.021
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies very well because females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females in the workplace or in a female </v>

1108
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>dominant Turkey and the male hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rules are not the same.</v>

1109
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1110
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of sexual attractiveness </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension between older women and younger </v>

1111
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:26.880
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1112
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't play the same way with men </v>

1113
01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:34.610
<v Speaker 2>and and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts a strange dynamic into the </v>

1114
01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>workplace and it's certainly by no means</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>

1115
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:40.290
<v Speaker 2>evidence self evident that women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's best friends in the workplace </v>

1116
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:44.881
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are all things that we don't </v>

1117
01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 2>understand well and are afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address.</v>

1118
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:50.191
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very curious about the female </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy because it's not </v>

1119
01:05:50.191 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the same presumptions as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the male dominance hurricane.</v>

1120
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend of mine who's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very insightful person and he was </v>

1121
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1122
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the mode of dress that's characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 2>of repressive Islam,</v>

1123
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of his hypothesis was that it </v>

1124
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.841
<v Speaker 2>was a way that the older women exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over the sexual attractiveness </v>

1125
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:13.831
<v Speaker 2>of the younger women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's actually not primarily a </v>

1126
01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:15.370
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that's associated with male </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance of women at all.</v>

1127
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis and highly credible because </v>

1128
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 2>young women have a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual power and,</v>

1129
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 2>and that needs to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1130
01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it a complicating factor.</v>

1131
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:30.610
<v Speaker 2>We could at least get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can at least get away with that.</v>

1132
01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:35.611
<v Speaker 2>It's a massively complicating factor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also don't know the degree to which </v>

1133
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 2>women use sexual attractiveness in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace as a,</v>

1134
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 2>as a motive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieving dominance and power.</v>

1135
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I've thought about for</v>

1136
01:06:43.721 --> 01:06:44.440
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1137
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not suggesting that this is </v>

1138
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:49.880
<v Speaker 2>something that should be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1139
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.050
<v Speaker 2>truly a Gal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society that was truly aiming at </v>

1140
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:55.750
<v Speaker 2>removing sex bias from the workplace </v>
<v Speaker 2>might ban makeup.</v>

1141
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not self evident to me that that's,</v>

1142
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
<v Speaker 2>that's appropriate from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a technical perspective in the </v>

1143
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.171
<v Speaker 2>workplace because it mixes sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness with functionality in a </v>

1144
01:07:10.171 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1145
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:15.370
<v Speaker 2>in a way that at least is complex now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't ever say that we should go so</v>

1146
01:07:15.371 --> 01:07:19.480
<v Speaker 2>far as to ban makeup in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a point to be made there,</v>

1147
01:07:19.481 --> 01:07:24.481
<v Speaker 2>which is that we haven't separated out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the politics from the sexual politics </v>

1148
01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:25.600
<v Speaker 2>and that's a major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major problem.</v>

1149
01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1150
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 2>and partly because we can't have real </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions about it.</v>

1151
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that stays unaddressed.</v>

1152
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to stop,</v>

1153
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1154
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy that you agreed to talk </v>

1155
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>with me today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1156
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm a great admirer of your website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Colette has done a remarkable </v>

1157
01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope we get a chance to talk again.</v>

1158
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly going to encourage all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are watching and listening to</v>

1159
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 2>contribute to your patron account </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I really believed that support </v>

1160
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.300
<v Speaker 2>for that is going to be in everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>best interest,</v>

1161
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1162
01:08:03.491 --> 01:08:08.491
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks very much for the conversation </v>

1163
01:08:08.491 --> 01:08:11.101
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that we get a chance to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in the relatively near future and </v>

1164
01:08:11.101 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you know when this is up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

1165
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1166
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice talking to you.</v>

1167
01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
