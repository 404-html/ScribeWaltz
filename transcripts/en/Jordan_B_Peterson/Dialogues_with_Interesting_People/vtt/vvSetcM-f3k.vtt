<v Speaker 1>and look up events.</v>

34
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>under events also in this video is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion that I recently did last </v>

35
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact it was just released with Ben </v>

36
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro as part of his New Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast initiative and I think we had a </v>

37
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.181
<v Speaker 1>very good conversation and so the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this video is taken up with the </v>

38
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>conversation that I had with Ben.</v>

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I think we got farther on the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how human perception and cognitive </v>

40
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:54.951
<v Speaker 1>function is nested inside a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative substrate and we related that </v>

41
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:00.561
<v Speaker 1>to modern findings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology related to hemispheric </v>

42
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an excellent discussion </v>

43
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm very happy to bring it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

44
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>There's some ads in it because I took it</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly from Ben's video,</v>

45
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:55.351
<v Speaker 1>and I've been able to get farther in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking than I was in my book and each </v>

62
00:03:55.871 --> 00:04:00.871
<v Speaker 1>of the talks is designed to eliminate a </v>

<v Speaker 2>your prominence has just blown up in the</v>

108
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 2>year and a half when we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the show about why that is and </v>

109
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 2>why there are so many people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly are very angry about you.</v>

110
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I notice there was an article in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politico suggesting that young,</v>

111
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.800
<v Speaker 2>angry white males,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your profile has become so big of late </v>
<v Speaker 2>and number two,</v>

115
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.130
<v Speaker 2>why do you think it is that so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the of the left are so angry </v>

116
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.731
<v Speaker 2>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they characterizing people who </v>

117
00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:24.731
<v Speaker 2>listen to you as angry and enraged?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young white men?</v>

118
00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 2>We could look at the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterization</v>

119
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.120
<v Speaker 3>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

120
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 3>because I think it speaks to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathology of the radical left instantly.</v>

121
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 3>There are absolutely incapable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewing the world except through group </v>

122
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>identity terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know when.</v>

123
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 3>So if someone comes out and disagrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>

124
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>then they have to characterize them by </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fundamental group attribute,</v>

125
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:47.381
<v Speaker 3>whatever that happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's gender because that's a </v>

126
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 3>favorite or maybe it's race and so angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>white men young.</v>

127
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 3>There'll be go sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ageist,</v>

128
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 3>and racist all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

129
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 3>They're angry young white men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

130
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 3>it has to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be the.</v>

131
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to play the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this game because that's the only way </v>

132
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.101
<v Speaker 3>that you can look at the world and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't make your opponent </v>

133
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:09.461
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible in some manner and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange that they would attempt to make </v>

134
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 3>them reprehensible on the grounds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

135
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex since that's precisely what they </v>

136
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.031
<v Speaker 3>stand against hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you can't make your enemy </v>

137
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:22.300
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible along some dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to contend with them </v>

138
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.591
<v Speaker 3>seriously and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not an outright right fascist </v>

139
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:30.371
<v Speaker 3>like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was how I was characterized in </v>

140
00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:34.481
<v Speaker 3>Canada because the radical leftists </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even get their bloody insults </v>

141
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:34.481
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

142
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 3>He's like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no difference between </v>

143
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

144
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 3>No obvious difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just another attempt to pilloried </v>

145
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's.</v>

146
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 3>It's dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it is.</v>

147
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 3>There was an article written by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

148
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I believe the editor of the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>review of books that was just </v>

149
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.801
<v Speaker 3>republished in the globe and Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about the emergence of </v>

150
00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 3>hypermasculinity and how I was somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for that are contributing to</v>

151
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 3>it like most Fellini and I read that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

152
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like miscellaneous and I thought,</v>

153
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are you doing?</v>

154
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 3>I see you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're defining masculinity are </v>

155
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 3>conflating masculinity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypermasculinity at the same time.</v>

156
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Then your virtue signaling by being </v>
<v Speaker 3>against hypermasculinity,</v>

157
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320
<v Speaker 3>but really what you're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring down whatever it is that's </v>

158
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.951
<v Speaker 3>masculinity and what masculinity is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this frame is something like </v>

159
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 3>competence and so it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical leftists,</v>

160
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.510
<v Speaker 3>general war on competence.</v>

161
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 3>It all as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is one of the most </v>

162
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 3>pernicious elements of the culture wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dissolution of hierarchies.</v>

163
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:43.661
<v Speaker 3>They the assumption that every hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be based on power and serve the </v>

164
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 3>needs of your group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that happens to be,</v>

165
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.040
<v Speaker 3>that there's no such thing as competence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so and then the other thing that's </v>

166
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible about it because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not enough,</v>

167
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 3>is that it's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's.</v>

168
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I've got tens of thousands of letters </v>
<v Speaker 3>from people and people come up to me all</v>

169
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 3>the time on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example.</v>

170
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 3>This is a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really touching.</v>

171
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.550
<v Speaker 3>So I was in la about a month and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and I was downtown La and downtown </v>

172
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.501
<v Speaker 3>La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of rough and I was wondering </v>

173
00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:17.811
<v Speaker 3>around and with my wife and this young </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy pulled the car up beside you,</v>

174
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.320
<v Speaker 3>knocked out and he was kind of a stylish</v>
<v Speaker 3>look in 21 year old Latino guy,</v>

175
00:09:21.321 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

176
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>It was all excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

177
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 3>he asked me who I was and I told him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

178
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he had presumed and so he </v>

179
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:31.330
<v Speaker 3>was kind of excited about that and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

180
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.101
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched all your lectures and it's </v>

181
00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:35.541
<v Speaker 3>really helped me and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>straightening out my life and trying to </v>

182
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:35.541
<v Speaker 3>get my room clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me laughed about that,</v>

183
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>developing some names and trying to tell</v>

184
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 3>the truth and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and look,</v>

185
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I've really fixed up my relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my father.</v>

186
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 3>And so then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

187
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wait a minute.</v>

188
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

189
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.670
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he went back in the car and God </v>

190
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 3>is farther out of his car and he came </v>
<v Speaker 3>over with his dad like they have their </v>

191
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 3>arms around each other and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

192
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.650
<v Speaker 3>we've really improved our relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were both smiling away.</v>

193
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 3>And you know that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to target me for that,</v>

194
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 3>just go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds real white supremacist.</v>

195
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

196
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's wherever I go now,</v>

197
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.650
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that's so wonderful </v>

198
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this as far as I'm concerned,</v>

199
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 3>is that people come up to me all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and that's exactly what they say.</v>

200
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

201
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I was lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aimless,</v>

202
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 3>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic.</v>

203
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drug addicted,</v>

204
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 3>alcoholic wasting my time masturbating </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much.</v>

205
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Although they don't generally use that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular example last essentially and,</v>

206
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hopeless in some sense.</v>

207
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:38.331
<v Speaker 3>And I've been watching your lectures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've really helped and I've really </v>

208
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:41.451
<v Speaker 3>been putting my life together and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>been trying to say what I believe to be </v>

209
00:10:41.451 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>true and develop a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really helped and like,</v>

210
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 3>and it's so overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

211
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm doing book signings after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>

212
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>then they'll be a dozen people or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>who and these aren't like I'm only </v>

213
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:59.181
<v Speaker 3>talking to people for about 15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can have a very intense </v>

214
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 3>conversation in 15 seconds and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

215
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

216
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was suicidal man.</v>

217
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I was really hanging onto the edge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the earth by my fingernails and I'm </v>

218
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have tears in their eyes.</v>

219
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

220
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Middle with that goes a long way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

221
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that when I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at your rise and look,</v>

222
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people who love what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 2>every time I go on the road and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking at a campus,</v>

224
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>you're the number one name that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned at people by people who come </v>

225
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.241
<v Speaker 2>to my lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the reason for that </v>

226
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:30.241
<v Speaker 2>that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've seen is,</v>

227
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:33.681
<v Speaker 2>is really twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that one of the things that you </v>

228
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 2>really talk a lot about is the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>self discipline and purpose in your life</v>

229
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:40.741
<v Speaker 2>and control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you are in control of </v>

230
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:40.741
<v Speaker 2>your decision making and your decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making matters,</v>

231
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.040
<v Speaker 2>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is that you have,</v>

232
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>you have a unique capacity to say no to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and when somebody says something </v>

233
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.170
<v Speaker 2>to you that is illogical but popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have the capacity to say no.</v>

234
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:55.171
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in that Kathy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Newman interview that somebody was </v>

235
00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:55.171
<v Speaker 2>saying to you that made no sense</v>

236
00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 3>and you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no.</v>

237
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 3>And then you just stood on that now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you stand on that.</v>

238
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:03.181
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it gives people a lot of </v>

239
00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:03.181
<v Speaker 3>courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

240
00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:03.181
<v Speaker 3>well I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

241
00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:06.110
<v Speaker 3>the gender issue is really an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting one because one of my </v>

242
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>professional domains of expertise is </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual differences.</v>

243
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:13.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a personality psychologist and so I </v>

244
00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:14.360
<v Speaker 3>know the gender difference literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

245
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a very solid literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well first of all it's very solid.</v>

246
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 3>It has a 30 year history once per </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists got the personality models</v>

247
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be the big five model.</v>

248
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 3>All empirically derived straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics,</v>

249
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brute Force empiricism.</v>

250
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Nobody had a theoretical ax to grind </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the big five except to say maybe </v>

251
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 3>there are human traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're encapsulated in language.</v>

252
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 3>We can use statistical techniques to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what they are.</v>

253
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

254
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so very,</v>

255
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 3>very neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as ideology,</v>

256
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 3>school five traits emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

257
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Are there differences between the sexes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out there are all right.</v>

258
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:58.051
<v Speaker 3>They're not massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although a few some them across all the </v>

259
00:12:58.051 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 3>traits you can separate men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>with about 75 percent accuracy,</v>

260
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.980
<v Speaker 3>so it's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to sum across all the </v>

261
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:04.980
<v Speaker 3>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then another question comes up,</v>

262
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are those differences social,</v>

263
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 3>cultural or biological?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

264
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 3>We can test that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go around.</v>

265
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 3>The world will look at cultures will </v>
<v Speaker 3>rank order them in terms of the gender,</v>

266
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:20.071
<v Speaker 3>equality of their sociological policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do that with broad agreement from</v>

267
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:25.591
<v Speaker 3>the right and the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the hypothesis would be if gender </v>

268
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 3>differences decrease among more </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian societies,</v>

269
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 3>then the gender differences are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sociocultural or at least more associate</v>

270
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:37.321
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the opposite of what was </v>

271
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 3>found repeatedly that pseudo science.</v>

272
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

273
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 3>that's mainstream psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those papers have thousands of citations</v>

274
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.900
<v Speaker 3>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average humanities paper has zero </v>

275
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:48.900
<v Speaker 3>citations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

276
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 3>And then the next most common one has </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

277
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 3>3000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an.</v>

278
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 3>That's an unbelievable classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

279
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 3>and here's the other bit of fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>

280
00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:01.471
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that you can trust </v>

281
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:03.301
<v Speaker 3>someone's judgment about a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact emerges despite their </v>

282
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 3>ideological presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

283
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 3>so it's well known that the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>sciences and the humanities have a,</v>

284
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 3>have a left tilt and a lot of that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperamental and the tilt has become </v>

285
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 3>more pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as Jonathan hightest pointed out,</v>

286
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>there are no conservatives among social </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality psychologist or,</v>

287
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.970
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or none to speak of.</v>

288
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Very few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vanishingly few.</v>

289
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.600
<v Speaker 3>And if the field has a bias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is definitely and indisputably a left</v>

290
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 3>wing bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

291
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>so you have to fight that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a scientist,</v>

292
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

293
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're left wing scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to fight that because you want </v>

294
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.941
<v Speaker 3>to get to the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was these social scientists who </v>

295
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:45.181
<v Speaker 3>generated the data that suggested that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender differences not only were </v>

296
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that were bigger and to Galitary and</v>

297
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:50.791
<v Speaker 3>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do that to grind the </v>

298
00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 3>radiological acts because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological.</v>

299
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Presupposition was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

300
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:57.611
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make the society you get with </v>

301
00:14:57.611 --> 00:14:57.611
<v Speaker 3>Terrian men and women get more of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

302
00:14:57.611 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

303
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 3>they get more different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

304
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 3>isn't that something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then there's a corollary there,</v>

305
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 3>which is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could still say,</v>

306
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 3>and they're kind of pushing in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction in Scandinavia,</v>

307
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and women are different.</v>

308
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 3>It looks biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because people are malleable,</v>

309
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you could push the sociocultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure harder and harder to minimize </v>

310
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 3>the biological differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

311
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe and maybe not.</v>

312
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you get a rebound and they'd get </v>
<v Speaker 3>even like the kids would rebel.</v>

313
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 3>That could easily happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's say,</v>

314
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

315
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.320
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you see that much power to </v>

316
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:43.691
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're basically giving the state </v>

317
00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:43.870
<v Speaker 3>the right to socialize your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

318
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

319
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really want to do that.</v>

320
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:53.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in Israel couldn't do that </v>

321
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:53.411
<v Speaker 3>with the cabooses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

322
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.410
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people aren't going to give up their </v>

323
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:56.410
<v Speaker 3>children to the state and thank God for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

324
00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is one of the big questions </v>

325
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.441
<v Speaker 3>that we were discussing earlier is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about the polarization </v>

326
00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:02.920
<v Speaker 3>in politics between right and left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously you're,</v>

327
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you're a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a philosopher,</v>

328
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but you've been dragged almost kicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and screaming into this political sphere</v>

329
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:11.600
<v Speaker 3>because everything has been so </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicized.</v>

330
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And so when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say social science statistics </v>

331
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.520
<v Speaker 3>and they are scientifically based,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're called a racist.</v>

332
00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:20.230
<v Speaker 3>You're called the sexist or called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobe and all my.</v>

333
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a.</v>

334
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:26.441
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why do you think it is that so many </v>

335
00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:29.711
<v Speaker 3>folks on the left who purport to be all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about reason and science and and </v>

336
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 3>objective factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so willing to throw those out the window</v>

337
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.720
<v Speaker 3>the minute that it becomes politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>inconvenient because you imagine that </v>

338
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.770
<v Speaker 3>cognitive system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so an interpretation of the world has </v>

339
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 3>levels there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Axiomatic levels,</v>

340
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.160
<v Speaker 3>some fundamental presuppositions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more fundamental than others and you </v>

341
00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 3>could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

342
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:54.341
<v Speaker 3>the leftists historically maybe because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their atheistic rationality are more </v>

343
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 3>on the side of science than say the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists of any sort,</v>

344
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>but when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find out how the axioms or are </v>

345
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 3>nested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's deeper axioms underneath that </v>

346
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.130
<v Speaker 3>which is that all hierarchies are based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on power and all power plays are based </v>

347
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 3>on group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribal identity essentially,</v>

348
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.680
<v Speaker 3>and that the entire history of the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nothing but a power play between </v>

349
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.650
<v Speaker 3>between these different identity groups.</v>

350
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

351
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 3>well if the science indicates that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that's wrong,</v>

352
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 3>then do you alter those beliefs or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you alter the science?</v>

353
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.130
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

354
00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how you've hierarchically </v>
<v Speaker 3>arranged those.</v>

355
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 3>If the science is at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you alter your beliefs,</v>

356
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's the scientific facts or the </v>

357
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>axiomatic some structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you then you altered your beliefs.</v>

358
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 3>If your beliefs are the axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>substructure,</v>

359
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 3>then you alter the science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we've seen how that plays out,</v>

360
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I've tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak is to diagnose the axiomatic</v>

361
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

362
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the.</v>

363
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 3>What's the metaphysical presumption </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the radical left?</v>

364
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what what it is is your basically your </v>

365
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.571
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your groups are basically engaged in </v>

366
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:08.571
<v Speaker 3>warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

367
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 3>and the warfare is arbitrary except in </v>
<v Speaker 3>so far as it serves your group.</v>

368
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy any of that.</v>

369
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:19.461
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a route to certain </v>

370
00:18:19.461 --> 00:18:22.011
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a degeneration into </v>

371
00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 3>tribalism and that we will seriously pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>

372
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.920
<v Speaker 3>not only because it returns us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribalism and tribes fight as the </v>

373
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>anthropological evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming,</v>

374
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tribes spite.</v>

375
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even matter if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee tribes.</v>

376
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Even chimpanzee tribes fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only do you regress to a </v>

377
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:44.721
<v Speaker 3>tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also invalidate the one </v>

378
00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 3>proposition that's been able to help us </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise above the tribal,</v>

379
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 3>which is the idea that the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be sovereign.</v>

380
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:55.130
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the culture war is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the proper framework within which</v>

381
00:18:56.161 --> 00:19:01.161
<v Speaker 3>to view human identity and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the individual and </v>

382
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 3>the group in relationship to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

383
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 3>And the leftist answer is it's all group</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all powered like.</v>

384
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just a second.</v>

385
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the,</v>

386
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.550
<v Speaker 2>some of the more enlightenment minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers who are out there right now </v>

387
00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.330
<v Speaker 2>because it seems like we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing the big gap in,</v>

388
00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:24.331
<v Speaker 2>in Western civilization right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is between the collectivists and </v>

389
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:24.331
<v Speaker 2>the individualist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to put it broadly,</v>

390
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:28.990
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>divisions among the individualist in </v>

391
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:28.990
<v Speaker 2>just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

392
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to say thanks to our sponsors </v>
<v Speaker 2>over at Birch gold.</v>

393
00:19:29.151 --> 00:19:34.151
<v Speaker 2>So with the uncertainty of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market right now with all of the </v>

394
00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:38.021
<v Speaker 2>volatility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Americans are increasingly </v>

395
00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:38.021
<v Speaker 2>concerned about the security of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>savings.</v>

396
00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:39.830
<v Speaker 2>And the Federal Reserve obviously has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose monetary policy.</v>

397
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:44.831
<v Speaker 2>It's been shoring up recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of volatility in the </v>

398
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:44.831
<v Speaker 2>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

399
00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:45.230
<v Speaker 2>this is the reason why I need to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends over at Birch gold,</v>

400
00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:46.910
<v Speaker 2>so vertical Dicom is the place to go.</v>

401
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 2>If you want to put some of your assets </v>
<v Speaker 2>in precious metals.</v>

402
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying take all of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>money out of the stock market and push </v>

403
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>it and precious metals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be stupid,</v>

404
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.610
<v Speaker 2>but you should have a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>precious metals to hedge against </v>

405
00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.801
<v Speaker 2>inflation and volatility in the markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vertical sells physical precious metals </v>

425
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 2>That's [inaudible] dot com slash Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also wants to know that we sent </v>

426
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

427
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.711
<v Speaker 2>so Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we've been </v>

428
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.481
<v Speaker 2>talking about obviously is the big gap </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think we certainly agree on </v>

429
00:20:54.481 --> 00:20:56.730
<v Speaker 2>between the collectivists identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and,</v>

430
00:20:56.731 --> 00:21:01.731
<v Speaker 2>and the sublimation of science in favor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of subjective politics that favors a </v>

431
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:03.470
<v Speaker 2>power group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

432
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk a little bit about a </v>

433
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.411
<v Speaker 2>division that is also now breaking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>among those of us who I think would </v>

434
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 2>consider yourselves friends of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

435
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 2>So you consider yourself a friend of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment style thinking at least in</v>

436
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:21.181
<v Speaker 2>the essence that individuality matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the individual is sovereign </v>

437
00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 2>scientific nf at the end that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>

438
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Data matters are useful.</v>

439
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

440
00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 2>and in this group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

441
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:31.201
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself as part of this group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have started to call it the </v>

442
00:21:31.201 --> 00:21:31.201
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris is part of this group.</v>

443
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

444
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.900
<v Speaker 2>there are a wide variety of folks with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of broad political differences that </v>

445
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 2>are part of this group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are some real differences that</v>

446
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>are broken out even among people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider themselves part of this group.</v>

447
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:46.921
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven pinker has a different </v>

448
00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:46.921
<v Speaker 2>perspective on the world then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you do a,</v>

449
00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I have a different perspective than Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris does.</v>

450
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 2>You and I have our differences probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>on some matters of philosophy.</v>

451
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.360
<v Speaker 2>So where do you think that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability lies in the,</v>

452
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.600
<v Speaker 2>in the possibility of vivifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment mentality?</v>

453
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems to me that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big problems that's,</v>

454
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:05.581
<v Speaker 2>that's popping its head up above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water now is the rejection of the </v>

455
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:08.611
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment in favor of this old style</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism that you've been talking </v>

456
00:22:08.611 --> 00:22:12.391
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we're now going to repeat history </v>

457
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:14.221
<v Speaker 2>because we benefited so much from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and we forget that things </v>

458
00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got so much nice stuff.</v>

459
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:19.921
<v Speaker 2>We live in so much freedom that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget that if we just tossed those </v>

460
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment ideals out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things get really ugly again.</v>

461
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what unites us</v>

462
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

463
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>that's the question is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

464
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.280
<v Speaker 3>what do you toss out the window before </v>
<v Speaker 3>things get ugly,</v>

465
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the enlightenment proponents,</v>

466
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you could say Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say pinker,</v>

467
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles Taylor in Canada,</v>

468
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.130
<v Speaker 3>they trace back the development of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern self.</v>

469
00:22:40.131 --> 00:22:45.131
<v Speaker 3>Let's say Taylor wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources of the modern self to the </v>

470
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:49.211
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's quite interesting because like </v>

471
00:22:49.211 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the typical academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists say their historical </v>

472
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.720
<v Speaker 3>knowledge generally runs back about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

473
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.760
<v Speaker 3>And so because they're all concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

474
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.890
<v Speaker 3>with the modern literature and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some utility in that.</v>

475
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.070
<v Speaker 3>But the downside is they don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical context.</v>

476
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.020
<v Speaker 3>So you read someone like Taylor and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

477
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:05.540
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's stretching it back 500 years,</v>

478
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

479
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 3>there's reading that goes way beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to look at the sources of the self </v>

480
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 3>and the source of the modern ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a huge bone of contention </v>

481
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.081
<v Speaker 3>between people like me saying people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Harris and I think between people </v>

482
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:24.521
<v Speaker 3>like you and people like us is that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense is that the enlightenment values </v>

483
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:29.411
<v Speaker 3>themselves are grounded in an ethos </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's much deeper and much less </v>

484
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:29.510
<v Speaker 3>articulated.</v>

485
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.290
<v Speaker 3>And that would be an ethos of metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>image,</v>

486
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 3>drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ritual,</v>

487
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.170
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>

488
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.620
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that dance even for that matter,</v>

489
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 3>the nonverbal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pattern recognition.</v>

490
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Ian Mcgilchrist has written a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Master and his emissary,</v>

491
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 3>which lays that out quite nicely with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to hemispheric specialization.</v>

492
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.210
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of predicated on Elk Conan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Goldberg's observation that the left </v>

493
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.321
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere is specialized for what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and the right hemisphere is </v>

494
00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 3>specialized for what we don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an order chaos dynamic.</v>

495
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>And the rough idea would be that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left hemisphere generates paradigmatic </v>

496
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.231
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be like the enlightenment </v>

497
00:24:11.231 --> 00:24:11.231
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>axiom predicated,</v>

498
00:24:11.231 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even stainable axiom predicated,</v>

499
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.680
<v Speaker 3>but that that entire axiomatic system is</v>
<v Speaker 3>based in a nonverbal,</v>

500
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.780
<v Speaker 3>in the nonverbal domain that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with while it would be </v>

501
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.161
<v Speaker 3>associated with the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would also be associated with </v>

502
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:29.630
<v Speaker 3>deep motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological motivations and emotions.</v>

503
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 3>And so because here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's one way of looking at it.</v>

504
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.800
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

505
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.830
<v Speaker 3>how do you validate an axiomatic system </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ethics?</v>

506
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Psj figured this out is you play it</v>

507
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 3>out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally you acted out in the world and</v>

508
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:49.241
<v Speaker 3>then you watch each other's emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses and if the thing that you're </v>

509
00:24:49.241 --> 00:24:53.261
<v Speaker 3>playing out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the axiomatic system that you're </v>

510
00:24:53.261 --> 00:24:55.331
<v Speaker 3>playing out satisfies the motivations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the emotions of the people who are </v>

511
00:24:55.941 --> 00:25:00.941
<v Speaker 3>engaged in that system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the system is justified and then </v>

512
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:00.941
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

513
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that their motivations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions are satisfied.</v>

514
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.020
<v Speaker 3>It's more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that the motivations and emotions </v>

515
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.471
<v Speaker 3>of each individual are satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not only now but now next week,</v>

516
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.650
<v Speaker 3>next month and next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to extend it across time.</v>

517
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.590
<v Speaker 3>And not only my emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations,</v>

518
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.240
<v Speaker 3>but yours as well.</v>

519
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next week,</v>

520
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 3>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and across time.</v>

521
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's terribly tight constraints that </v>

522
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 3>are placed upon an act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An axiomatic system is validity.</v>

523
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Now the way jump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>piaget thought of that,</v>

524
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

525
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:38.141
<v Speaker 3>think about it like a child's game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of kids get together and they </v>

526
00:25:38.141 --> 00:25:41.651
<v Speaker 3>decided to play pretend okay and pretend</v>
<v Speaker 3>is let's mortal the world,</v>

527
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

528
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.620
<v Speaker 3>and as a place to act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because to pretend you don't,</v>

529
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the kids get together and they assign</v>

530
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 3>roles and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

531
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be dead,</v>

532
00:25:51.471 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be the dog and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to play house.</v>

533
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.780
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they acted out and what they're doing is</v>

534
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.810
<v Speaker 3>seeing if they can regulate the manner </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which they're constructing the game </v>

535
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.140
<v Speaker 3>so that everyone's emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations are so well satisfied that </v>

536
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.170
<v Speaker 3>they want to continue the game.</v>

537
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's so cool.</v>

538
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 3>So what it shows you is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how an ethical system is,</v>

539
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 3>is tested and justified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you play it out and you see if</v>

540
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 3>everyone wants to keep playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's a whole different </v>

541
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 3>methodology than the scientific domain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

542
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:28.301
<v Speaker 3>So the axiomatic system isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ethical axiomatic system isn't </v>

543
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 3>justified by reference to the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>method.</v>

544
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.770
<v Speaker 3>It's justified by reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional and motivational wellbeing of </v>

545
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.300
<v Speaker 3>all the players of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that game me emerges,</v>

546
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.570
<v Speaker 3>this is the second part of this and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so cool.</v>

547
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

548
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:48.981
<v Speaker 3>how does that game emerge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is the same way that </v>

549
00:26:48.981 --> 00:26:53.510
<v Speaker 3>children's games emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what Piaget noted is that kids would </v>

550
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 3>get together and they play marbles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were young kids,</v>

551
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 3>they could all play marbles say six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years old,</v>

552
00:26:57.961 --> 00:26:58.830
<v Speaker 3>they can all play marbles.</v>

553
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they were in a group,</v>

554
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:05.361
<v Speaker 3>they were playing marbles and it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out fine squabbles and all the </v>

555
00:27:05.361 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 3>kids would keep playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

556
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Validating the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you took the kids out of the game</v>

557
00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 3>and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the rules of the game,</v>

558
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 3>they would give completely disparate </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts.</v>

559
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.900
<v Speaker 3>So they knew how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the,</v>

560
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.960
<v Speaker 3>the wisdom was in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wisdom was fragmented enough among </v>

561
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 3>the individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you pull the individuals out,</v>

562
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:23.170
<v Speaker 3>they'd give disparate accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you put them altogether,</v>

563
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:28.250
<v Speaker 3>they could play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then if you waited until they were </v>

564
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.250
<v Speaker 3>11 or 12 and you pulled them out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

565
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.440
<v Speaker 3>then they can tell you the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then at 14 or 15 they would be willing </v>

566
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is with more sophisticated games,</v>

567
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 3>they would be more willing to regard </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves as makers of the rules.</v>

568
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's how it happens in an </v>

569
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.751
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People going all the way back to our </v>

570
00:27:47.751 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 3>primate forebears organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>into functional hierarchies.</v>

571
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hierarchies are complex and </v>

572
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 3>they're not just based on power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite what the idiot marks is,</v>

573
00:27:56.191 --> 00:28:01.191
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if the wall has noted that </v>

574
00:28:01.191 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee hierarchies are unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're only based on power,</v>

575
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 3>they don't last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They generate into violence.</v>

576
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So you have a hierarchy that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that works,</v>

577
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows why it works.</v>

578
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 3>It works because everyone seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with it.</v>

579
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so those hierarchies get more </v>

580
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.701
<v Speaker 3>complex and more sophisticated and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people start to observe them and talk </v>

581
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:22.701
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

582
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got this hierarchy here,</v>

583
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.880
<v Speaker 3>what's it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they spin off dramas about the </v>

584
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.091
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a hero who climbed up the </v>

585
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:32.091
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and here's what a hero looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

586
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then you get the idea of hierarchy </v>

587
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and then you get the idea of the hero as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who moves up the hierarchy </v>

588
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and generates it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

589
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Then out of that you get the extraction </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the idea of the hero and then you get</v>

590
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 3>development of that idea and it's out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

591
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 3>You get the monotheistic religions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like the procedure and the </v>

592
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.030
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy come first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what the rules are.</v>

593
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 3>It's all played out the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just play it out in the pack or </v>

594
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees play it out in their troop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we wake up and think,</v>

595
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in a structure.</v>

596
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Here's the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

597
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:04.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyrus,</v>

598
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 3>in the Egyptian mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the structure,</v>

599
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 3>here's how the structure goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what the structure does.</v>

600
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Here's its tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical aspect,</v>

601
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 3>here's what you have to do to generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure and to thrive it.</v>

602
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's even more important.</v>

603
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 3>The hierarchy is important enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we want to know is how to </v>

604
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 3>master the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

605
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get the mythologies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hero.</v>

606
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then so then there's generates all </v>

607
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.491
<v Speaker 3>sorts of different heroes because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different ways of being </v>

608
00:29:31.491 --> 00:29:32.010
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a panoply of heroes.</v>

609
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

610
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:38.121
<v Speaker 3>well now we've got all those heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a set we can move,</v>

611
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 3>pull back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

612
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 3>something about all these heroes is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them heroes.</v>

613
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 3>That's when you extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>monotheistic savior,</v>

614
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 3>because that's why in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ is the king of kings.</v>

615
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.040
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about it as a literal </v>

616
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 3>statement for forget about the religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>overlay.</v>

617
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

618
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.800
<v Speaker 3>you got a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are kind of king,</v>

619
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

620
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:05.821
<v Speaker 3>so you admire them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like for whatever reason that is </v>

621
00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:05.821
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

622
00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to figure out why you </v>
<v Speaker 3>admire someone,</v>

623
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's complicated,</v>

624
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.940
<v Speaker 3>but let's say you've got to admire </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable people.</v>

625
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 3>You start telling stories about that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why you go to a movie,</v>

626
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to go watch someone.</v>

627
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:16.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't care about your board by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

628
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you want to go watch someone admirable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and interesting or maybe the opposite of</v>

629
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

630
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you think,</v>

631
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:27.871
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we've got all these admirable </v>

632
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:27.871
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're generating the world properly.</v>

633
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:32.250
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes them admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a principle they embody and </v>

634
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 3>that principle is the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 3>the admirable world is generated.</v>

635
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

636
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.890
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that's operative at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of,</v>

637
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.020
<v Speaker 3>and here's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my question about about all of </v>

638
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.291
<v Speaker 3>this because now we're really not </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about 12 rules for life as much </v>

639
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:46.291
<v Speaker 3>as naps.</v>

640
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Meaning which is your first book which </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing need the audio recording </v>

641
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:49.680
<v Speaker 3>audio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

642
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a harder book,</v>

643
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.280
<v Speaker 3>a then 12 rules for life and a much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex book and a lot of ways than the </v>

644
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 3>12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how universal are these systems?</v>

645
00:30:56.081 --> 00:31:01.081
<v Speaker 3>Meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why isn't that the enlightenment only </v>

646
00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:01.081
<v Speaker 3>arrives at one time in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one place,</v>

647
00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:04.921
<v Speaker 3>in human history as opposed to if human </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology is essentially consistent </v>

648
00:31:04.921 --> 00:31:04.921
<v Speaker 3>across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

649
00:31:04.921 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 3>across humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then why is it that that you know,</v>

650
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 3>if at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the apex of the levels you adapt with</v>

651
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.120
<v Speaker 3>the enlightenment idea which started </v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular question,</v>

652
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:18.330
<v Speaker 3>then why is it that it only arrives in </v>
<v Speaker 3>one place at one time as opposed to </v>

653
00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.660
<v Speaker 3>arriving in a variety of places in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety of different kinds of great </v>

654
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.470
<v Speaker 3>culture and that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing we would say is the </v>

655
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.531
<v Speaker 3>process by which this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy itself and success within </v>

656
00:31:28.531 --> 00:31:29.680
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy is generated.</v>

657
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 3>That's to be accounted over millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

658
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 3>at least hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of thousands of years,</v>

659
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 3>but I would push it back because you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>see analogs in the chimps,</v>

660
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 3>so 20 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

661
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>That's a long time on that timescale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that the enlightenment values </v>

662
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 3>of in Europe 500 years ago before </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere else,</v>

663
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

664
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:50.850
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

665
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 3>It's five old men long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

666
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 3>If you put five 100 mineral men in line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's yesterday,</v>

667
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 3>it's this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've.</v>

668
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 3>We've evolved these hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

669
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 3>That's our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've evolved ways of maneuvering within</v>

670
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:12.901
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchical structures that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and now we've started to </v>

671
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:15.220
<v Speaker 3>evolve ways of mapping our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our adaptation,</v>

672
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 3>not just adapting but mapping it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

673
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 3>so how does the mapping occur?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>

674
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 3>admiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

675
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.900
<v Speaker 3>invitation of admiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that would be drama.</v>

676
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you dramatize Shakespeare,</v>

677
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 3>extracts out what's admirable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and plays it out,</v>

678
00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 3>so that's the use of the body as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>representational structure of the body.</v>

679
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 3>So we act out what's admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

680
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:42.700
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we've kind of got the drama down,</v>

681
00:32:42.701 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 3>were all captured by this drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

682
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 3>well then the literary critics come </v>
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>

683
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 3>the philosophers and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

684
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 3>what are the principles by which the </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable people operate?</v>

685
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like chimps woke up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

686
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 3>well some chimps are more successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>than others.</v>

687
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 3>What are the rules of success?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

688
00:32:58.221 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were no rules because they weren't</v>

689
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:04.901
<v Speaker 3>running by rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There aren't rules until you described </v>

690
00:33:04.901 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 3>the patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a rule.</v>

691
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens with Moses by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

692
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses has a revelation.</v>

693
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Here's the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

694
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:15.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd been living out those rules </v>

695
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.291
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know what they were </v>

696
00:33:17.291 --> 00:33:17.291
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were customs.</v>

697
00:33:17.291 --> 00:33:17.291
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

698
00:33:17.291 --> 00:33:22.211
<v Speaker 3>so you start by mapping your customs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>drama and story and that way you can </v>

699
00:33:22.921 --> 00:33:24.570
<v Speaker 3>represent them and you can transmit </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

700
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Then once you have them in your grip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the representative now not just act </v>

701
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.860
<v Speaker 3>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you can move one step backward</v>

702
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:35.130
<v Speaker 3>from them and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

703
00:33:35.131 --> 00:33:37.860
<v Speaker 3>what's the commonalities among these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the general principles?</v>

704
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.980
<v Speaker 3>That would be the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like the code of Hammurabi,</v>

705
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:42.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

706
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got all these customs.</v>

707
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.510
<v Speaker 3>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

708
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.560
<v Speaker 3>Revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

709
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you map the customs.</v>

710
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.370
<v Speaker 3>That's the decalogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same idea.</v>

711
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:55.790
<v Speaker 3>So I took human beings are very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to evolve their hierarchies,</v>

712
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.280
<v Speaker 3>to evolve their structures of success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then to have enough people around </v>

713
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:07.171
<v Speaker 3>with enough spare time to engage in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural process of the artistic </v>

714
00:34:07.481 --> 00:34:10.900
<v Speaker 3>cultural process of mapping the adaptive</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

715
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:16.170
<v Speaker 3>not only merges in mythology and drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that lays the groundwork for </v>

716
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.470
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the philosophers could come in,</v>

717
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Speaker 3>especially once it's written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the Judeo Christian Pantheon.</v>

718
00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:20.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

719
00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:25.270
<v Speaker 3>now we've got it written down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh well we don't have to remember it.</v>

720
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.840
<v Speaker 3>We can read it and while we're reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can think about it.</v>

721
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.650
<v Speaker 3>And so then out of that starts to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>the semantic codes.</v>

722
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Well then you get the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

723
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's a bunch of semantic codes.</v>

724
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

725
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:38.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are great.</v>

726
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.570
<v Speaker 2>So this is really interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 2>if you read pinker or if regional </v>
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg's new book,</v>

728
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.150
<v Speaker 2>essentially they attribute the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment to Jonah.</v>

729
00:34:45.151 --> 00:34:50.151
<v Speaker 2>Colbert calls it the miracle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost as though it accidentally </v>

730
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:50.151
<v Speaker 2>occurred in a certain place at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

731
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Joan doesn't quite go quite that far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to be fair to him,</v>

732
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:57.221
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that philosophy that this </v>

733
00:34:57.221 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 2>sort of sprang up randomly here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

734
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:02.441
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very much embedded in a lot of Sam </v>

735
00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Harris is thinking a lot of thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking it further back.</v>

736
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>But I do wonder if this may be an area </v>
<v Speaker 2>of actual disagreements.</v>

737
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:08.690
<v Speaker 2>We have two of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be fun.</v>

738
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Are you attributing the growth of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaeo Christian ethic that emerges into</v>

739
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:18.680
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment as also accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>just pushing timeline further back?</v>

740
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.830
<v Speaker 3>You think it's accidental?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

741
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making a reduction to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing is I'm going to say </v>

742
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.500
<v Speaker 3>this is how religion evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not saying,</v>

743
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that this explanation </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausts the phenomena because it's a </v>

744
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.520
<v Speaker 3>very strange phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

745
00:35:35.521 --> 00:35:36.720
<v Speaker 3>very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

746
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean we can't generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>a plausible evolutionary account.</v>

747
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:45.350
<v Speaker 3>So like if you have a bunch of motivated</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional limited beings occupying the </v>

748
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 3>same territory and competing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperating for the same resources,</v>

749
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>including the resource of cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 3>which can generate more resources,</v>

750
00:35:55.201 --> 00:36:00.201
<v Speaker 3>is not a zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are going to be patterns of </v>

751
00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 3>adaptation that emerged from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are similar.</v>

752
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 3>So here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put a bunch of kids together,</v>

753
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.980
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna evolve games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

754
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Well which games?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

755
00:36:10.171 --> 00:36:11.560
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

756
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 3>but they're all games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

757
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 3>So even though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the moral relativist element.</v>

758
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of different games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the moral absolute establishment is,</v>

759
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

760
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 3>but they're all games and the games have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be playable,</v>

761
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.930
<v Speaker 3>which means they have to continue in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>iterative way.</v>

762
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big constraint.</v>

763
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 3>People have to want to play them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only did they have to be games,</v>

764
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and comprehensible to everybody hand </v>

765
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:39.400
<v Speaker 3>enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people,</v>

766
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but they have to be self maintaining and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has to want to play with them.</v>

767
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the answer to the postmodern </v>

768
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.881
<v Speaker 3>conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A plethora of potential ethical </v>

769
00:36:49.881 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 3>implications of the world and infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety.</v>

770
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

771
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not an infinite variety of pragmatically</v>

772
00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:02.061
<v Speaker 3>applicable interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You instantly constrained the universe </v>

773
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:02.061
<v Speaker 3>to while too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what?</v>

774
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why there's commonalities in </v>

775
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.511
<v Speaker 3>mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you put enough people </v>

776
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:11.991
<v Speaker 3>together in enough different places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the commonality of the groups of people </v>

777
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 3>there because of the grounding in common</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation and emotion and embodiment,</v>

778
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:21.140
<v Speaker 3>because we're embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>means that they're gonna generate </v>

779
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.470
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies that are broadly similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with strategies of success within those </v>

780
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.500
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies that are broadly similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with descriptions of the strategies that</v>

781
00:37:28.501 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 3>are broadly similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you could say in some sense,</v>

782
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:36.650
<v Speaker 3>the ethic that gave rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment is in place more or less </v>

783
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

784
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tricky because not every </v>

785
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical system is as functional as </v>
<v Speaker 3>every other hierarchical system.</v>

786
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny.</v>

787
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:50.390
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the set of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily playable games or something </v>

788
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that can degenerate out of that.</v>

789
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:56.691
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get common myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to and then that and that lays </v>

790
00:37:56.691 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 3>the groundwork that lays the groundwork </v>
<v Speaker 3>for even our ability to communicate.</v>

791
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

792
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

793
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 3>the enlightenment dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

794
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.190
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

795
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 3>and this gets to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

796
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.550
<v Speaker 3>the broader question that I know you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam went on for three hours about,</v>

797
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 3>about the nature of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a particularly truth in the moral</v>

798
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:12.000
<v Speaker 3>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>

799
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

800
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:17.770
<v Speaker 3>and what would it be fair to say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys agree on the idea of truth in </v>

801
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:17.770
<v Speaker 3>the scientific sphere that did you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

802
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:22.580
<v Speaker 3>if something is that there is such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as objective truth or are you </v>

803
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.120
<v Speaker 3>going to say we agree on a lot of that.</v>

804
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.480
<v Speaker 3>The question is to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do scientists accept the idea that </v>

805
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.171
<v Speaker 3>objective truth is true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would say we probably don't </v>

806
00:38:33.171 --> 00:38:37.401
<v Speaker 3>agree about that because I would ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in and Sam would ground out in the </v>

807
00:38:37.401 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 3>idea of an independently existing </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective world,</v>

808
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a leap of faith,</v>

809
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 3>more like my own actually than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pragmatist view.</v>

810
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you believe that there's a god </v>

811
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:48.960
<v Speaker 3>who's out there in the universe who </v>
<v Speaker 3>created the structures and in particular</v>

812
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 3>certain way than what he created is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

813
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.861
<v Speaker 3>And it is apart from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if human beings didn't exist and </v>

814
00:38:55.861 --> 00:38:55.861
<v Speaker 3>they weren't able to utilize the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that truth would still exist out there,</v>

815
00:38:55.861 --> 00:38:59.810
<v Speaker 3>whereas the pragmatists might say it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth is in the use that it has for him.</v>

816
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.210
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we would consider a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific truth true unless we are also</v>

818
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:11.470
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously accepting the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific truth is good for people.</v>

819
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.950
<v Speaker 3>So there's one other thing I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring up that's relevant because you </v>

820
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 3>brought up the idea of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

821
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know what to make of this </v>

822
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 3>because this is stretching me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is stretching my thoughts out </v>

823
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 3>beyond where I've been able to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

824
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So this is the intuition that I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on a variety of things,</v>

825
00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:35.131
<v Speaker 3>experiences I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that there's a very wide </v>

826
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:36.310
<v Speaker 3>range of human behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

827
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.140
<v Speaker 3>And some subset of those are both </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable and not admirable.</v>

828
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 3>So let's call them good and evil at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

829
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 3>at the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

830
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

831
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:52.170
<v Speaker 3>there's a pattern that characterizes all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actions that are good and a pattern </v>

832
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 3>that characterizes all the actions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are evil,</v>

833
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.300
<v Speaker 3>and that's a transpersonal pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

834
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not just about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about everyone.</v>

835
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then that gets persona fund.</v>

836
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 3>That's Christ and Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

837
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 3>or Cain and Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

838
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 3>That gets personified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a bad guy,</v>

839
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 3>a good guy in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's personified all the time.</v>

840
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.500
<v Speaker 3>It's thor and Loki.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the marvel movies,</v>

841
00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:13.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you have the,</v>

842
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 3>let's say you take the idea of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

843
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:21.151
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the abstraction of everything </v>

844
00:40:21.151 --> 00:40:23.971
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's admirably good about the set of </v>

845
00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:25.030
<v Speaker 3>all human behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

846
00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

847
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>what sort of reality does that have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this pulls back into the reality of </v>

848
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Send the idea that it was the logos that</v>

849
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 3>God used at the beginning of time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>extract order out of chaos.</v>

850
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.090
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

851
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.400
<v Speaker 3>it's transpersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goodness,</v>

852
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.600
<v Speaker 3>because it's not just characterized </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick of any one person.</v>

853
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 3>It's more like something that inhabits a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person other than that a person is.</v>

854
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 3>You can really see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

855
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:54.700
<v Speaker 3>on the other end too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the satanic end,</v>

856
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 3>because if you read the writings of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who do absolutely horrific things</v>

857
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:04.471
<v Speaker 3>like the shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that possession </v>

858
00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your eyes are open,</v>

859
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shocking,</v>

860
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 3>so people don't usually look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they even say that themselves,</v>

861
00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 3>like the columbine kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their writings or hair raising,</v>

862
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were called clearly possessed </v>

863
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.951
<v Speaker 3>by an evil that you only encounter if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit in a dark place and brood on </v>

864
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:24.510
<v Speaker 3>your hatred for months and years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

865
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 3>You go places that you go places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the dark people go,</v>

866
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

867
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 3>And then that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes you over.</v>

868
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the good and can take you over as </v>

869
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

870
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this spirit of good,</v>

871
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.840
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what the spirit of good does is act </v>

872
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.991
<v Speaker 3>in the world on the potential of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world to generate the actuality of the </v>

873
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:49.670
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Judeo Christian proposition is,</v>

874
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 3>is that if you confront the potential of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world with good in mind,</v>

875
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 3>using truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truthful communication,</v>

876
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:02.110
<v Speaker 3>then the order that you extract is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that's echoed in genesis when </v>

877
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 3>God is using the word and he creates </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos audit potential.</v>

878
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 3>And every time he does that he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was good.</v>

879
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so interesting because </v>

880
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a proposition there and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition there is that if you </v>

881
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 3>encounter potential with truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos you create is actually good.</v>

882
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

883
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 3>that's just an absolutely overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

884
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's true,</v>

885
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:26.400
<v Speaker 3>it's the greatest idea that river </v>
<v Speaker 3>watson.</v>

886
00:42:26.401 --> 00:42:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

887
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.750
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

888
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.760
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually from maps of meeting help </v>

889
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.450
<v Speaker 2>generate what we in a injuries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Barataria and Hebrew leading into</v>

890
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.950
<v Speaker 2>a thought about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

891
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:36.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible.</v>

892
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:41.910
<v Speaker 2>But this merged with a little diversity </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien thought led me to the idea that </v>

893
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.460
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the mystical notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tree of good and evil in,</v>

894
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.410
<v Speaker 2>in Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that supposed to be?</v>

895
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.440
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did people do wrong by eating from </v>

896
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.421
<v Speaker 2>the tree of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my feeling is that what they did </v>

897
00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:57.511
<v Speaker 2>wrong is that God created a universe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which the value was embedded in the </v>

898
00:42:57.511 --> 00:42:58.330
<v Speaker 2>object right there in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in your,</v>

899
00:42:58.331 --> 00:43:03.331
<v Speaker 2>in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about if you're teaching a child </v>

900
00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:05.820
<v Speaker 2>about an object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules of the object are embedded in </v>

901
00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.240
<v Speaker 2>the teaching about the object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you use the example of the vase.</v>

902
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 2>We were discussing this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

903
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.180
<v Speaker 2>but you used the example of a vase where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you teach your child,</v>

904
00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:13.330
<v Speaker 2>don't touch the base because the base </v>
<v Speaker 2>will break so that the rules embedded in</v>

905
00:43:13.331 --> 00:43:15.850
<v Speaker 2>the object in the same way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aristotelian thought,</v>

906
00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.850
<v Speaker 2>the rules for behavior are embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the universe.</v>

907
00:43:18.851 --> 00:43:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Meaning what makes a man good is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them unique,</v>

908
00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:24.580
<v Speaker 2>which is the reason they ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason is what makes me unique.</v>

909
00:43:24.581 --> 00:43:29.581
<v Speaker 2>So acting in accordance with right </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason is what makes something is what </v>

910
00:43:29.581 --> 00:43:32.671
<v Speaker 2>makes an action good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you believe that God created the </v>

911
00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:34.831
<v Speaker 2>universe along these lines and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural law is just a human attempt to </v>

912
00:43:34.831 --> 00:43:37.630
<v Speaker 2>understand the lines along which created</v>
<v Speaker 2>God created the universe,</v>

913
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:43.050
<v Speaker 2>then we're human beings went wrong is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they decided to separate values </v>

914
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.160
<v Speaker 2>from the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we decided to take values and say,</v>

915
00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:48.250
<v Speaker 2>this is a completely separate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this base has no rules attached to it</v>

916
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:53.251
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a vase and we can construct </v>

917
00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:55.741
<v Speaker 2>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrarily is to what to do with this </v>

918
00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:55.741
<v Speaker 2>vase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so eating from the tree of knowledge</v>

919
00:43:55.741 --> 00:44:00.541
<v Speaker 2>of good and evil changes the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and evil from the universe comes </v>

920
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:03.010
<v Speaker 2>along with a set of rules to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

921
00:44:03.011 --> 00:44:08.011
<v Speaker 2>Think that they can use their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuition to supplant God's rules and </v>

922
00:44:08.011 --> 00:44:11.461
<v Speaker 2>discipline universal rules with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own particular vision of what the </v>

923
00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 2>universe ought to be and at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be expelled for.</v>

924
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

925
00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:14.490
<v Speaker 3>So that's also associated to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>

926
00:44:14.491 --> 00:44:19.491
<v Speaker 3>I would say with Milton's warning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradise lost because Milton basically </v>

927
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.630
<v Speaker 3>portrays Lucifer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the bringer of light.</v>

928
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the spirit of unbridled rationality,</v>

929
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 3>which accounts for the say the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 3>Church antagonism,</v>

930
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 3>the Catholic churches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antagonism towards rationality,</v>

931
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:36.561
<v Speaker 3>the idea was same idea and the Tower of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Babel that human beings have a </v>

932
00:44:36.561 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 3>proclivity to direct their own dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

933
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.810
<v Speaker 3>ethical systems and then to expand them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a grandiosity that challenges the </v>

934
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian catastrophe.</v>

935
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 3>And for Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan was the spirit that eternally does</v>

936
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

937
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Who says everything I know is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the plants.</v>

938
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.720
<v Speaker 3>What I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that supplants that transcendent and </v>

939
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:02.940
<v Speaker 3>that that's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How that's tangled up with the,</v>

940
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.120
<v Speaker 3>with the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're making some headway </v>

941
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:08.120
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards sorting that out.</v>

942
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is a cataclysm that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's explained in,</v>

943
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>

944
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

945
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.100
<v Speaker 3>The cataclysm is the coming two to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wakefulness and its associated partly </v>

946
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:24.381
<v Speaker 3>with recognition of nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is recognition of vulnerability </v>

947
00:45:24.381 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 3>and Mortel and ham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the discovery of death.</v>

948
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 3>And then also the discovery of good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil that goes along with that.</v>

949
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 3>So you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

950
00:45:28.861 --> 00:45:33.861
<v Speaker 3>that's partly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cognitive division of ethics from </v>

951
00:45:33.861 --> 00:45:35.970
<v Speaker 3>the facts of the object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have to think that through.</v>

952
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I would also recommend to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I mentioned this before,</v>

953
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:43.521
<v Speaker 3>is Ian mcgilchrist spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the master and his emissary because he </v>

954
00:45:43.521 --> 00:45:46.760
<v Speaker 3>looks at this neuropsychologically right</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and looks at the left hemisphere as </v>

955
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.440
<v Speaker 3>the hemisphere that's dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>explicitly axiomotic systems and the </v>

956
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 3>right hemisphere that's dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>what those systems are embodied in.</v>

957
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so part of what happens with the </v>

958
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:00.980
<v Speaker 3>emergence of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as far as I could tell,</v>

959
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.290
<v Speaker 3>it took me a long time to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the w,</v>

960
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.170
<v Speaker 3>and this is different than the than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis that you laid forward,</v>

961
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 3>which is why I can't reconcile that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly as you recognize,</v>

962
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 3>you're naked.</v>

963
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.880
<v Speaker 3>You know you can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're vulnerable and </v>

964
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.361
<v Speaker 3>insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hide from God because that's what </v>

965
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 3>happens next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason you hide from God say God</v>

966
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:27.111
<v Speaker 3>is your destiny or God is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're walking with God is a </v>

967
00:46:27.111 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of your ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proper destiny.</v>

968
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.360
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you doubt whether you're capable of that</v>

969
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:35.361
<v Speaker 3>because now you realize you're embodied </v>
<v Speaker 3>finitude your nakedness and </v>

970
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:36.390
<v Speaker 3>insufficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you hide in your ashamed.</v>

971
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:41.750
<v Speaker 3>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also realize that you can be hurt </v>

972
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 3>and suffer and that Kinda goes along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with God's command,</v>

973
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:47.811
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to work in the sweat </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your brow and that you're going to </v>

974
00:46:47.811 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 3>die and that women are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjugated to men,</v>

975
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 3>which has put on as a curse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as a moral imperative,</v>

976
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

977
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 3>but then what emerges out of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as soon as you,</v>

978
00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you know that you can be hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what differentiates us from </v>

979
00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.130
<v Speaker 3>other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you really think that through,</v>

980
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>here's all the myriad ways I can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

981
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Then you're angry about that because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be heard,</v>

982
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.600
<v Speaker 3>but even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out how to hurt other </v>

983
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:11.600
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

984
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 3>and so that's part of that knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil.</v>

985
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 3>You associated with this dissociation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

986
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.790
<v Speaker 3>of the object from its ethical can </v>
<v Speaker 3>obtain the right of the universe has </v>

987
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:23.721
<v Speaker 3>created by God from our interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe that there is a gap </v>

988
00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:27.171
<v Speaker 3>between the two and that once human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings begin to supplant their own </v>

989
00:47:27.171 --> 00:47:30.201
<v Speaker 3>rationality for a telus right in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the diversity here and that geology </v>

990
00:47:30.201 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 3>well we end up doing is creating all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of awful systems that end up </v>

991
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.030
<v Speaker 3>destroying us in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But something about that.</v>

992
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

993
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.140
<v Speaker 3>part of what happens in the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>testament as far as I can tell is that </v>

994
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.800
<v Speaker 3>what Christ says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's trying to transcend the rule </v>

995
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 3>structure might be not because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything wrong with the rule.</v>

996
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 3>If they're necessary precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline,</v>

997
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Speaker 3>which is actually white wrote 12 rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

998
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like you need rules but there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rules conflict and they don't always</v>

999
00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 3>apply and so there has to be an ethic </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying the rules and you should have</v>

1000
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 3>more respect for the ethic than for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>

1001
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1002
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Christ's idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the idea of the </v>

1003
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.141
<v Speaker 3>reestablishment of paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you should orient yourself </v>

1004
00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:13.951
<v Speaker 3>towards the good and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an alliance with God and then that </v>

1005
00:48:13.951 --> 00:48:18.291
<v Speaker 3>you should tell the truth and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethic that generated the rules to begin </v>

1006
00:48:18.291 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1007
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 3>and then we can be serious about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 3>and we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1009
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.160
<v Speaker 3>how do you adjudicate the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that claim?</v>

1010
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we might think,</v>

1011
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:31.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already walked through the fact that </v>

1012
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 3>the heroes of the past acted on </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential to extract out the world of </v>

1013
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:38.431
<v Speaker 3>actuality and if they did that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the world they extracted was good </v>

1014
00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 3>and that that is a divine principle.</v>

1015
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.690
<v Speaker 3>And then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1016
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't been defined principles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

1017
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:47.410
<v Speaker 3>well what is it that's acting through </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the good,</v>

1018
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 3>like the Christian theological answer to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the logos,</v>

1019
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

1020
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea of the Holy Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

1021
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might think,</v>

1022
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a real thing?</v>

1023
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1024
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:02.461
<v Speaker 3>to me it's real the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is real and we don't know </v>

1025
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 3>the role of consciousness in determining</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality even,</v>

1026
00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:08.470
<v Speaker 3>but even if you're an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologist,</v>

1027
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:14.070
<v Speaker 3>and this is so interesting because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary biologists actually </v>

1028
00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 3>discriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiated themselves from Darwin on</v>

1029
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 3>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Darwin was very,</v>

1030
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:22.291
<v Speaker 3>very forthright in his claim that sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>selection was as powerful as natural </v>

1031
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:27.271
<v Speaker 3>selection or even more so and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's where this that goes in and </v>

1032
00:49:27.271 --> 00:49:31.500
<v Speaker 3>because that was because that brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness into the world as an </v>

1033
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 3>active player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the materialistic evolutionary biologist</v>

1034
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:37.981
<v Speaker 3>ignored that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like 150 years and only concentrated </v>

1035
00:49:37.981 --> 00:49:37.981
<v Speaker 3>on natural selection where they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

1036
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:42.990
<v Speaker 3>While this is all chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like sexual selection is not </v>

1037
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.090
<v Speaker 3>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1038
00:49:43.091 --> 00:49:48.091
<v Speaker 3>so here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human being separated themselves from </v>

1039
00:49:48.091 --> 00:49:51.631
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons they did that was </v>

1040
00:49:51.631 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 3>because human females are sexually </v>
<v Speaker 3>selective.</v>

1041
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Chimps aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps will female chimps in estrus will</v>

1042
00:49:55.751 --> 00:50:00.751
<v Speaker 3>mate with any chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main chimps that dominant ones </v>

1043
00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 3>chased the subordinate males away so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to have offspring,</v>

1044
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:05.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because of female choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1045
00:50:05.981 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Female human females have done this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole different things that they've,</v>

1046
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1047
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.690
<v Speaker 3>they have hidden fertility and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more likely to go after guys who </v>

1048
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:22.111
<v Speaker 3>have climbed up the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say heroes will give the </v>

1049
00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 3>women's some credit for intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1050
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:28.051
<v Speaker 3>And say that that's what they're after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they are using wealth and so </v>

1051
00:50:28.051 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 3>forth and status as a marker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually using those as a marker</v>

1052
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:30.570
<v Speaker 3>for competence.</v>

1053
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's,</v>

1054
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I think the evidence think the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that is clear.</v>

1055
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>

1056
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:40.511
<v Speaker 3>oh well it was human female conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice that selected us.</v>

1057
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1058
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 3>well that's not random,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not random at all.</v>

1059
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 3>It's the farthest thing from random that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>

1060
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:51.551
<v Speaker 3>And that means consciousness is making </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's choices with regards to what </v>

1061
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:54.551
<v Speaker 3>propagates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it's even more complex than </v>

1062
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's what happens among men.</v>

1063
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 3>The man all get together in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

1064
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 3>they pause a valued goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all accept that as the goal because</v>

1065
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they wouldn't be cooperating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1066
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Then they arrange themselves into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and they let the most </v>

1067
00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 3>competent guys lead because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to.</v>

1068
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:14.350
<v Speaker 3>They want to get to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to get the most competent </v>

1069
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:14.830
<v Speaker 3>leaders leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1070
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Competent defined by that value.</v>

1071
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's what happens.</v>

1072
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:23.861
<v Speaker 3>Essentially the men all get together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote on the good man and the good men </v>

1073
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 3>are then chosen by the women and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the people who propagate and so it's</v>

1074
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:35.441
<v Speaker 3>like men are voting on which men get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reproduce and women are going along with</v>

1075
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 3>the vote and and being even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>stringent in their,</v>

1076
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:39.230
<v Speaker 3>in their choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1077
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:44.380
<v Speaker 3>And so then what you get is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that through its active </v>

1078
00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.881
<v Speaker 3>expression transforms the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world into actuality also selects </v>

1079
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the direction of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1080
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:58.121
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the meme darkens term </v>
<v Speaker 3>turns into the biological reality.</v>

1081
00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1082
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's so cool about </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkens.</v>

1083
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've often thought this about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dawkins is if he would push his thinking</v>

1084
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:08.710
<v Speaker 3>to the limits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would fall right into young.</v>

1085
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 3>The men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be lost because that's a whole </v>

1086
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 3>other universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you take that mean seriously,</v>

1087
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.890
<v Speaker 3>like and I mean really seriously think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1088
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 3>there's some ways of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes so all encompassing,</v>

1089
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1090
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 3>They start to become an actual force of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution itself,</v>

1091
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.520
<v Speaker 3>and so then here's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could make consciousness extracts </v>

1092
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.230
<v Speaker 3>the proper world of being from potential</v>
<v Speaker 3>through truth and then it's good.</v>

1093
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1094
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.640
<v Speaker 3>that's a hard one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1095
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.120
<v Speaker 3>That manifests itself in human beings at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual level of individual </v>

1096
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the logos with it.</v>

1097
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 3>That's the metaphysical foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of natural right and </v>

1098
00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:52.820
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1099
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 3>that's a bloody killer idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's expressed in the hero of heroes.</v>

1100
00:52:57.051 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 3>That idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hero of heroes is the driving force</v>

1101
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 3>behind human evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so not only do you get the action of the</v>

1102
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:10.181
<v Speaker 3>logos metaphysically as the process that</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracts order out of chaos at the </v>

1103
00:53:10.181 --> 00:53:14.531
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also get it as the major driver of </v>

1104
00:53:14.531 --> 00:53:14.531
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you ask,</v>

1105
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:20.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what kind of reality does that </v>

1106
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:20.290
<v Speaker 3>have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you chase consciousness back and</v>

1107
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 3>like it disappears into the mystery of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our past and we have no idea what it's </v>

1108
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.631
<v Speaker 3>relationship is with matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the forest that gives rise to </v>

1109
00:53:28.631 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos and drives evolution.</v>

1110
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're getting pretty close to</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1111
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 3>They're even just pragmatically </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>

1112
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 3>You're certainly not close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the midst of it,</v>

1113
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.650
<v Speaker 3>an argument about free will because </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously if you.</v>

1114
00:53:38.651 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 3>If you make the hard determinist </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

1115
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:45.591
<v Speaker 3>that free will doesn't exist and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is merely a sort of trick </v>

1116
00:53:45.591 --> 00:53:47.340
<v Speaker 3>that your brain is playing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then how exactly does.</v>

1117
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 3>How does culture propagate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do,</v>

1118
00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 3>how do these means propagate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are people choosing sexual selection</v>

1119
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:57.621
<v Speaker 3>and natural selection become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same as soon as you boil sexual </v>

1120
00:53:57.621 --> 00:54:00.081
<v Speaker 3>selection down to natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think that the freewill </v>

1121
00:54:00.081 --> 00:54:04.640
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see why Harris gets tangled up </v>

1122
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:04.640
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 3>because well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deterministic arguments are unbelievably</v>

1124
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 3>powerful and when we use deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 3>models for many things,</v>

1125
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.250
<v Speaker 3>they really were right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could say,</v>

1126
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:12.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to use that by default.</v>

1127
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

1128
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:18.681
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna deviate from that with care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't see people as driven like </v>

1129
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 3>clocks winding down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1130
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:27.171
<v Speaker 3>we don't wind down in any simple way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're dissipative structures to use.</v>

1131
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:32.681
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote Schrodinger what is life a </v>

1132
00:54:32.681 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 3>human being as a dissipative structure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>

1133
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 3>we're not an entropic structure like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clock running down.</v>

1134
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 3>We are in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as living beings,</v>

1135
00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:43.881
<v Speaker 3>we pull energy in and so we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>winding down like a deterministic </v>

1136
00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:47.721
<v Speaker 3>structure where something other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and the way we treat each other is </v>

1137
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.810
<v Speaker 3>as logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>

1138
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 3>the way I treat myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to be good to myself in the</v>

1139
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:59.451
<v Speaker 3>proper sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I'm an active agent of choice </v>

1140
00:54:59.451 --> 00:55:03.201
<v Speaker 3>confronting and infinite landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential and casting that potential </v>

1141
00:55:03.201 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 3>into a reality for good or for evil.</v>

1142
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I treat myself that way,</v>

1143
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:12.861
<v Speaker 3>then I have proper respect for myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and proper fear of myself because I can </v>

1144
00:55:12.931 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 3>make bad decisions and work the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of reality.</v>

1145
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:20.420
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you read Frankel through </v>
<v Speaker 3>example or Solzhenitsyn and you see how </v>

1146
00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 3>your bad decisions can work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure of reality,</v>

1147
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 3>then that wakes you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1148
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's that.</v>

1149
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 3>If you don't treat yourself like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an active agent imbued with logos,</v>

1150
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 3>then your life doesn't go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more if you don't treat other people</v>

1151
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do not want to play with you.</v>

1152
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:43.010
<v Speaker 3>If we set up societies that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the idea that people are </v>

1153
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the society's become,</v>

1154
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 3>they'd dissolve or they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian almost instantly.</v>

1155
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 3>So then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1156
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.840
<v Speaker 3>you've got the problem of determinism </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1157
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1158
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:58.220
<v Speaker 3>How do you reconcile the fact that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you lay out a society at every level of </v>

1159
00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 3>the analysis on strict deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 3>grounds,</v>

1160
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 3>it fails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't,</v>

1161
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any in your hypothesis has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a flaw.</v>

1162
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>

1163
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facts are independent of the ethical</v>

1164
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.540
<v Speaker 3>concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what are the truth.</v>

1165
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Speaker 3>This is where the truth pragmatism </v>
<v Speaker 3>question back into being right?</v>

1166
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Because Sam say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1167
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regardless of what the effect is.</v>

1168
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 3>And you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1169
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:24.140
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously not true if morals are </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed for pragmatic reason and if </v>

1170
00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:24.140
<v Speaker 3>this pragmatism</v>

1171
00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.450
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it falls into nothingness,</v>

1172
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 2>but also it also depends to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you're willing to,</v>

1173
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 2>how you're willing to test your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

1174
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1175
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 3>if your hypothesis is factually correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you assume that if people base </v>

1176
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:37.940
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1177
00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their behaviors individually and </v>

1178
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:43.640
<v Speaker 3>familial and socially on that set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

1179
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.160
<v Speaker 3>which is basically what Sam claims about</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts to begin bandwidth.</v>

1180
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.280
<v Speaker 3>If you base your ethos or not those </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

1181
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1182
00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he claims that that's a test and I'd </v>

1183
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then it fails that test.</v>

1184
00:56:56.110 --> 00:57:00.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to treat each other like divine </v>

1185
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.060
<v Speaker 3>centers of consciousness in order for </v>
<v Speaker 3>society to work.</v>

1186
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1187
00:57:02.931 --> 00:57:03.680
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1188
00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:05.390
<v Speaker 3>I can't see anything</v>

1189
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:07.560
<v Speaker 2>way out of those arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1190
00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't say they're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you and I agree on so much </v>

1191
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:15.181
<v Speaker 2>about this kind of stuff and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's also the reason why people </v>

1192
00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:17.821
<v Speaker 2>find your work really inspiring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>while the left wants to claim that you </v>

1193
00:57:17.821 --> 00:57:19.970
<v Speaker 2>are an angry person or they'll claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly than I'm a deeply angry to.</v>

1194
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's been quite an </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry conversation.</v>

1195
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it has not been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1196
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.130
<v Speaker 2>but I feel horrified by what the radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>left is capable of,</v>

1197
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1198
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's,</v>

1199
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 2>it's demonstrative of why so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>find what you're doing inspiring because</v>

1200
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:39.270
<v Speaker 2>unlike the radical left which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed with the idea of victim hood </v>

1201
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 2>and victimology and were victims of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system like Marxism makes the claim that</v>

1202
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 2>the only way that peoplesoft is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton mark is a makes,</v>

1203
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:49.801
<v Speaker 2>but the only way to cure people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking is by changing the entire </v>

1204
00:57:49.801 --> 00:57:52.411
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will in some magical fashion </v>

1205
00:57:52.411 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 2>transform the nature of humanity in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper direction.</v>

1206
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Right color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the claim that you're making.</v>

1207
00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.940
<v Speaker 2>And I hope that I'm making as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that human beings do soc unless they </v>

1208
00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:00.840
<v Speaker 2>decide to stop sucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1209
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1210
00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 2>and your whole goal is to tell people </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly how it is the bacon and clean up</v>

1211
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>their rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a famous phrase.</v>

1212
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Guts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Well they might as well start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start</v>

1214
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:13.190
<v Speaker 3>with what's right in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot harder than it looks because </v>

1215
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:16.431
<v Speaker 3>to clean up your room means to accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's actually necessary for you to </v>

1216
00:58:16.431 --> 00:58:18.120
<v Speaker 3>take that little bit of chaos that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you,</v>

1217
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>that chaotic potential and cast it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitable order.</v>

1218
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:23.910
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to develop the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude towards that.</v>

1219
00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:24.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1220
00:58:24.391 --> 00:58:29.391
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to put my room in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what do you mean order is in </v>

1221
00:58:29.391 --> 00:58:32.220
<v Speaker 3>relationship to something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if your desk is ordered,</v>

1222
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:37.490
<v Speaker 3>it means you've ordered it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to work there and you're </v>

1223
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:40.191
<v Speaker 3>working there on something valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the order is conceived of in </v>

1224
00:58:40.191 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 3>relationship to a tee loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1225
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to order your room.</v>

1226
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Well what are you going to do in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's your room for,</v>

1227
00:58:45.931 --> 00:58:47.610
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose?</v>

1228
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:51.510
<v Speaker 3>You can't order your room without </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling into purpose.</v>

1229
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:52.530
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1230
00:58:52.531 --> 00:58:57.531
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to fall into purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like try it out on a local scale </v>

1231
00:58:57.531 --> 00:58:57.531
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1232
00:58:57.531 --> 00:58:59.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the system.</v>

1233
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you know?</v>

1234
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Leave the system alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what you can do locally,</v>

1235
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:09.860
<v Speaker 3>see if you can put yourself together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can put your immediate </v>

1236
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.471
<v Speaker 3>environment together and you'll find if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a chaotic household and a </v>

1237
00:59:12.471 --> 00:59:15.660
<v Speaker 3>chaotic household would be one where no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one has any discipline.</v>

1238
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.780
<v Speaker 3>No one has any ames and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible battle between Cain and Abel </v>

1239
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 3>going on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1240
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:26.351
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so life socks and everything is </v>

1241
00:59:26.351 --> 00:59:26.900
<v Speaker 3>miserable and more cynical and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what wisdom is.</v>

1242
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no point in trying anything </v>

1243
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.841
<v Speaker 3>because everything's meaningless than </v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell is going to care in a </v>

1244
00:59:34.841 --> 00:59:34.841
<v Speaker 3>million years and you're a full to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

1245
00:59:34.841 --> 00:59:36.950
<v Speaker 3>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's your household.</v>

1246
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now you decide.</v>

1247
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite all that,</v>

1248
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:46.151
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put my room in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like you will have a war on your </v>

1249
00:59:46.151 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 3>hands because the first thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around you who are aiming down,</v>

1250
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:48.800
<v Speaker 3>we'll do is think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1251
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:49.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

1252
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 3>you think you're so much better than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are?</v>

1253
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you really think that you and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fancy God damn plans?</v>

1254
00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:01.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're going to put every </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological obstacle we can possibly </v>

1255
01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 3>think of in your way because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed even in something that trivial,</v>

1256
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you shed a very dim light on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence and so we're going to put,</v>

1257
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do everything we can to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take you out,</v>

1258
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.680
<v Speaker 3>and so this people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1259
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:13.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cleaning your room.</v>

1260
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 3>That's just a cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1261
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1262
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I just go ahead and try it.</v>

1263
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:20.670
<v Speaker 3>You see how much of a cliche that is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got your room in order,</v>

1264
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.770
<v Speaker 3>then put your office in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1265
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.400
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The soon as you do that,</v>

1266
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 3>you step out into the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter that antipathy</v>

1267
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:34.001
<v Speaker 3>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter the identity </v>

1268
01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:36.581
<v Speaker 3>politics in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter how you </v>

1269
01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:39.971
<v Speaker 3>regulate your sexual morality while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working with people of the </v>

1270
01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:43.211
<v Speaker 3>opposite sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter the ethics </v>

1271
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:43.340
<v Speaker 3>that are necessary to move your business</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

1272
01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a microcosm.</v>

1273
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:50.711
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to take those microcosmic caused </v>

1274
01:00:50.711 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 3>him seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1275
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm asking people to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

1276
01:00:53.421 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't only about you being happy.</v>

1277
01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1278
01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pap.</v>

1279
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.910
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of times in your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be happy,</v>

1280
01:01:01.911 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 3>and so that's not gonna work.</v>

1281
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:08.350
<v Speaker 3>You want to have something meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the boat that will take you </v>

1282
01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:09.740
<v Speaker 3>through the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when you batten down the hatches,</v>

1283
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 3>but there's more ads isn't even that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't even me.</v>

1284
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.440
<v Speaker 3>A meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged life.</v>

1285
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 3>We'll see you through the catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a big deal,</v>

1286
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:19.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great proposition.</v>

1287
01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 3>And I really believe it's true because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say to yourself,</v>

1288
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it.</v>

1289
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and great.</v>

1290
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's the other part of it too,</v>

1291
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:32.351
<v Speaker 3>which is don't be thinking that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>errors aren't linked to hell because </v>

1292
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:35.570
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at what happened in the 20th</v>

1293
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:38.250
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brilliant commentators on the,</v>

1294
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 3>on the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian states and all of their </v>

1295
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 3>atrocities said the same thing over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

1296
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 3>It isn't top down evil leader </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating innocent masses.</v>

1297
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.920
<v Speaker 3>That's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the moral failings of every single </v>

1298
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.811
<v Speaker 3>individual unwilling to say their truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unwilling to act out what they know to </v>

1299
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:02.510
<v Speaker 3>be right that accumulate and produce the</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic state.</v>

1300
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're fussing about with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>

1301
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:08.030
<v Speaker 3>when you're not manifesting your </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential,</v>

1302
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:13.150
<v Speaker 3>when you're falsifying your speech and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your auctions in the service of short </v>

1303
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:16.541
<v Speaker 3>term expedience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are working to bring about hell on </v>

1304
01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:16.790
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's true.</v>

1305
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

1306
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And then it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1307
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I suspect it's also true metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real truth man.</v>

1308
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.580
<v Speaker 2>When you get the literal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical working at the same time,</v>

1309
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:29.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

1310
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't just that you have to fix up</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself so that you know you can have a</v>

1311
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 2>better life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1312
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>who cares about you for a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1313
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:41.301
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to fix up your life because if </v>

1314
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:43.371
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you make a mistake that you </v>

1315
01:02:43.371 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 2>know to be a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are leading the world toward hell.</v>

1316
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true.</v>

1317
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson's book is 12 rules for </v>

1318
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:51.500
