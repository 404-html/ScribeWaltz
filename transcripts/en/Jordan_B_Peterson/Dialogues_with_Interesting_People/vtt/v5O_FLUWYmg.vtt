<v Speaker 2>America and has been the subject of </v>

<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>

16
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 2>this is the book we're going to talk not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only about the book today,</v>

17
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boy crisis,</v>

18
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:21.591
<v Speaker 2>but also about Dr Farrell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his career and his goals and his aims </v>

19
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd like to introduce everyone to</v>

20
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Dr Warren Farrell and ask him to tell us</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's up to and why.</v>

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm up to sort of the </v>

22
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 3>evolution of maybe all that time since </v>
<v Speaker 3>1969.</v>

23
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the women's movement surfaced,</v>

24
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I was very interested in it and we felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>that women really need it to be able to </v>

25
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.180
<v Speaker 3>be equally respected and enter the </v>
<v Speaker 3>workplace and have options open.</v>

26
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 3>And I was upset that women were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing sports to the degree that I felt</v>

27
00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 3>that was creating the benefits to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sports.</v>

28
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:56.401
<v Speaker 3>And so I started articulating this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking to my doctoral </v>

29
00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:01.321
<v Speaker 3>dissertation advisors about doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their first reaction was war in the </v>

30
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.230
<v Speaker 3>women's movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fad.</v>

31
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

32
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>change of,</v>

33
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 3>of gender roles from both men and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

34
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 3>And so I will talk with them about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually convinced them that I could </v>

35
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.851
<v Speaker 3>change my dissertation and that led me </v>
<v Speaker 3>to being seen by now as someone who was </v>

36
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:23.941
<v Speaker 3>a man who was receptive at a time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the feminist movement was getting a lot </v>

37
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 3>of accusations of being man haters.</v>

38
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I think I served the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>

39
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 3>here's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real life flesh man who advocates,</v>

40
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 3>but we're advocating here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

41
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:38.611
<v Speaker 3>get up and say what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be harder to call you a </v>

42
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:38.611
<v Speaker 3>man hater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

43
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

44
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I started doing that and then ended up </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking all around the world on women's</v>

45
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 3>issues and the value of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of women being secure enough and </v>

46
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 3>competent enough to be able to share the</v>
<v Speaker 3>breadwinning burdens that men handle.</v>

47
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was my focus for until the mid </v>

48
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.260
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the mid seventies I began to see </v>

49
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 3>that the feminist had made a great deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>of progress.</v>

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.380
<v Speaker 3>And was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was sort of getting on board </v>

51
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.801
<v Speaker 3>who was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the sort of middle class </v>

52
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 3>above an educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

53
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

54
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 3>but it was also a huge number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>divorces occurring.</v>

55
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.530
<v Speaker 3>And so I began to say it's important for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children to have both parents after </v>

56
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 3>divorce and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman named Karen necro agreed with me,</v>

58
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 3>but I'm now the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the board of now at that time </v>

59
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.811
<v Speaker 3>had gotten elected as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocacy to the board of now and my </v>

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 3>fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

61
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female co workers on the board of now </v>

62
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.031
<v Speaker 3>said we were at a dilemma here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the dilemma is that the women are </v>

63
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.961
<v Speaker 3>writing us saying they're gonna withdraw</v>
<v Speaker 3>from now if they don't have the option </v>

64
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>to determine what happens with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children after divorce.</v>

65
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to lose now membership </v>

66
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 3>because it's not only important for </v>
<v Speaker 3>family purposes,</v>

67
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 3>but for all the other agendas we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I said,</v>

68
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:09.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the important thing is not women's </v>

69
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:09.721
<v Speaker 3>rights or men's rights.</v>

70
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 3>The important thing is knowing what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>best for the children.</v>

71
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.120
<v Speaker 3>And they said Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warren,</v>

72
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 3>great theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we really need to focus on </v>

73
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 3>empowering women and at a broad </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>

74
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 3>And so they ended up all voting in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of giving women the option to be fully </v>

75
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 3>involved with the children or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on the,</v>

76
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 3>under the guise that women know the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>though the children the best and </v>

77
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 3>therefore they know what's best for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

78
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I began to have a significant amount</v>

79
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.931
<v Speaker 3>of tension over that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem </v>

80
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 3>didn't weigh in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't on the board of now.</v>

81
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 3>And then all the other boards of nows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 3>around the country began to go the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that the New York City now went.</v>

83
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:53.041
<v Speaker 3>And so that led to my disengagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I started forming hundreds of </v>

84
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 3>men's groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of which I think,</v>

85
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was joined by John Lennon.</v>

86
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a,</v>

87
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:05.011
<v Speaker 3>that had a big impact on both the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the groups that I began to see what </v>

88
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 3>memes pain was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I began to articulate men's pain </v>

89
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 3>in as well as women's pain in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

90
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 3>in my presentations and when I was only </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulating women's pain and women's </v>

91
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:22.561
<v Speaker 3>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would always almost always get </v>

92
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:25.231
<v Speaker 3>standing ovations and maybe an average </v>
<v Speaker 3>of three invitations for a new speaking </v>

93
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 3>engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was helping me live financially</v>

94
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

95
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.560
<v Speaker 3>but then when I started to integrate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspectives and feelings of men from </v>

96
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 3>the men's groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

97
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

98
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 3>I think I didn't see those standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ovations.</v>

99
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not</v>

100
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 3>for new speaking engagements went from </v>
<v Speaker 3>three to two to one,</v>

101
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually to zero.</v>

102
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

103
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Speaker 2>it seems self evident in some sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're articulating truthfully and </v>

104
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 2>carefully what would be good for either </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex in some sense,</v>

105
00:05:56.251 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you have to be articulating what would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be good for both and unless you view the</v>

106
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 2>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you view reality as a battle </v>

107
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.650
<v Speaker 2>ground between the sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as an,</v>

108
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>as a zero sum game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have an intelligent </v>

109
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>conversation about what's good for women</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what's good for man.</v>

110
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 2>We have to have a conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's good for men and men and women </v>

111
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 2>and women and men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why do you think,</v>

112
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>what was your sense of why it was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you started to raise these other issues </v>

113
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>that you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were admitted immediately </v>

114
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two questions.</v>

115
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that made you unpopular</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why is it that you saw early </v>

116
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>cottoned onto the fact that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something going on that wasn't exactly </v>

117
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>kosher in relationship to now push for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

118
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>for a particular kind of family </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and a particular view of </v>

119
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>women's rights?</v>

120
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happened for me was,</v>

121
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

122
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started focusing on what was best</v>

123
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:03.531
<v Speaker 3>for children and then I began to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only had minimal amount of research </v>

124
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:06.750
<v Speaker 3>for that at that point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your early seventies and,</v>

125
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 3>but we had enough for me to make a case </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the board and when I saw the </v>

126
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 3>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the degree to which there is,</v>

127
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.290
<v Speaker 3>there was two things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is we don't want to lose our power </v>

128
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.661
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't ever want to have a woman say </v>

129
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever options she wants should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to her,</v>

130
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 3>and so I began to see that the women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement was caring more about women </v>

131
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 3>than they were caring about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

132
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 3>That was the first disillusionment that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I had.</v>

133
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're a first year,</v>

134
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:40.631
<v Speaker 2>first ethical point in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you're speaking about families</v>

135
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 2>and you have to balance the rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities of men,</v>

136
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:49.541
<v Speaker 2>women and children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it makes sense to you to put </v>

137
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:53.110
<v Speaker 2>children's wellbeing first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to place men and women as </v>

138
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 2>individual say or may perhaps even as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple below that.</v>

139
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

140
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Speaker 3>What I was saying was that freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice is wonderful,</v>

141
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.650
<v Speaker 3>but when you make the freedom of choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a child,</v>

142
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 3>you then start prioritizing the needs of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the child you made,</v>

143
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 3>but you knew that those needs were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the child's needs first.</v>

144
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 3>When you made that free choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't like you were coerced into </v>

145
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.961
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into or pressured into making that </v>

146
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:23.500
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made the free choice to have a child</v>

147
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.480
<v Speaker 3>that incorporates the need to put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>child's perspectives before yours.</v>

148
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:30.040
<v Speaker 3>That's part of your free choice.</v>

149
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically the freedom there is </v>

150
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.341
<v Speaker 2>the freedom to take on a certain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively permanent responsibility and </v>

151
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:41.460
<v Speaker 2>then to abide by that come hell or high </v>
<v Speaker 2>water essentially into the future</v>

152
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.200
<v Speaker 3>that the children should not respect the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents needs because part of what I </v>

153
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 3>talked about in the crisis is that ain't</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody happy,</v>

154
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 3>that everybody has to be happy at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and that and that part of </v>

155
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.630
<v Speaker 3>choosing a child to be responsible is </v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers and the child not just to have </v>

156
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 3>its needs met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to also a care about what,</v>

157
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

158
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 3>what their moms or dads needs are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>met as well.</v>

159
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 3>And that has to be very primary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>primal and introduced early.</v>

160
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that the,</v>

161
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then secondly,</v>

162
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also felt to end and Betty Friedan and</v>

163
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:20.691
<v Speaker 3>felt this way also that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women's movement would never go as </v>

164
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:25.011
<v Speaker 3>far as it could go unless the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless men were equally involved and </v>

165
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.490
<v Speaker 3>proud of being involved in the fathering</v>
<v Speaker 3>role because a woman who has to take on </v>

166
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.351
<v Speaker 3>the entire response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman who wants to break glass </v>

167
00:09:36.351 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 3>ceilings and go as far as she can but </v>
<v Speaker 3>also wants children can do that.</v>

168
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.290
<v Speaker 3>All of the man is working full time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's working full time.</v>

169
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Either the children get neglected or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something has to go.</v>

171
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 3>when we will often say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a habit or a woman and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

174
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 3>you can be a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All women revere.</v>

175
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Find a man who wants to be home full </v>
<v Speaker 3>time with the children and let's reshape</v>

176
00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:59.590
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're saying that,</v>

177
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that men are not only worrier warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>

178
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 3>that we praise and call heroes when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to war and they die for us,</v>

179
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 3>but they're also warriors if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose.</v>

180
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you choose a man who wants to be </v>

181
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.081
<v Speaker 3>fully involved with the child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's honor him and respect him because </v>

182
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:21.681
<v Speaker 3>we know that the social bribes that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave men to die allowed men to be </v>

183
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.730
<v Speaker 3>willing to sacrifice their lives in </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange for being called hero.</v>

184
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

185
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we read frame being a father as being</v>

186
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 3>a different type of hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men will follow because men basically go</v>

187
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 3>wherever the praise goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

188
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the seventies,</v>

189
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:42.910
<v Speaker 2>so you started to put forward the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>for children and to some degree as well,</v>

190
00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:47.911
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously the case for fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you received a fair bit of </v>

191
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:51.661
<v Speaker 2>resistance as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it sounds like the way you're </v>

192
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:53.590
<v Speaker 2>setting up the argument is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

193
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 2>What was the conflict though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it that the women who were being </v>

194
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.031
<v Speaker 2>appealed to by now wanted untrammeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of choice for them under all </v>

195
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:06.190
<v Speaker 2>circumstances?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the reason I'm asking is because</v>

196
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 2>if you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously half the children you have or </v>

197
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.091
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you assume that if it was a matter </v>

198
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.650
<v Speaker 2>of of women's opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be best for women in any kind</v>

199
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:22.651
<v Speaker 2>of medium to longterm manner that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns about daughters would be </v>

200
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 2>perhaps even if it isn't concerns about </v>
<v Speaker 2>psalms,</v>

201
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:29.020
<v Speaker 2>it would be concerned about daughters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would emerge is paramount even over</v>

202
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.880
<v Speaker 2>the concerns of the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

203
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't exactly get why it was </v>

204
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.800
<v Speaker 2>that you weren't being successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't make sense</v>

205
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 3>because the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the priority.</v>

206
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.490
<v Speaker 3>There was two things happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>

207
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.820
<v Speaker 3>One was such a strong emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom and the freedom manifested in </v>

208
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.651
<v Speaker 3>two areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is in the area of divorce in </v>

209
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:53.651
<v Speaker 3>divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that women were often saying,</v>

210
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't like my husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to start a new life.</v>

211
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to move out of state </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I wish to to get a job that I want or</v>

212
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 3>my new husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my new husband or boyfriend has a.</v>

213
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.650
<v Speaker 3>has a wants to move out of state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to be able to take my </v>

214
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 3>children or child with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

215
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.620
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

216
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know what's best for my child,</v>

217
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.820
<v Speaker 3>which would be like the medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>community saying we don't want women to </v>

218
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.391
<v Speaker 3>be participating in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>community because we know what's best </v>

219
00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 3>for the patient and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not I,</v>

220
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 3>not that women might have separate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

221
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 3>a contribution to make.</v>

222
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was the,</v>

223
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.760
<v Speaker 3>there was women who wanted to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom to be able to have children </v>

224
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.170
<v Speaker 3>without being married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

225
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.200
<v Speaker 3>and so 53 percent of women under 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>today who have children in the United </v>

226
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 3>States have children without being </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

227
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.350
<v Speaker 3>And the belief was again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that women knew what was best for the </v>

228
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.350
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we could,</v>

229
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.050
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could take this on if they want it </v>

230
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.050
<v Speaker 3>to and they couldn't find a man that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they really wanted a,</v>

231
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.651
<v Speaker 3>that they can raise a child by </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves with the children that </v>

232
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:55.651
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

233
00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.150
<v Speaker 3>so part of it was actually driven by </v>
<v Speaker 3>questioning the necessity of the nuclear</v>

234
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:04.621
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the smallest viable unit and part </v>

235
00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:04.860
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>

236
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 3>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

237
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feminist community started,</v>

238
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

239
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>when I would go to a feminist rallies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on,</v>

240
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.820
<v Speaker 3>there would be many books about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 3>then in the nuclear family being the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patriarchal that were oppressing </v>

242
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

243
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 3>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think the feminist,</v>

244
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 3>the feminist movement grew out of two </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge iterations.</v>

245
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 3>One was the civil rights movement where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an oppressor and oppressed.</v>

246
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Then there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

247
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.180
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

248
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.890
<v Speaker 3>the movement of not just civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

249
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.600
<v Speaker 3>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the civil rights movement came </v>

250
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Marxism and the belief that there </v>

251
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.250
<v Speaker 3>were oppressors and oppressed in among </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxists.</v>

252
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the feminist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the early feminist movement was very.</v>

253
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.130
<v Speaker 3>We had groups like red stockings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>many other groups like that that were </v>

254
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.250
<v Speaker 3>socialist worker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>party type feminists that very much </v>

255
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.131
<v Speaker 3>believed in Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had the dichotomy of oppressor </v>

256
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 3>versus oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it came to men,</v>

257
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.240
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we earned more because our </v>

258
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 3>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not our biological parents socialized </v>

259
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 3>and biological responsibility was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>earn the money and do that.</v>

260
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Speaker 3>That type of nature of providing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists movement looked at the fact </v>

261
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 3>that we earned more money once we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and so therefore we must be the</v>

262
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:30.181
<v Speaker 3>oppressor like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the porch was he a of Marxism and </v>

263
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 3>women must be the press.</v>

264
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>So we have two things happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>

265
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:38.521
<v Speaker 3>This belief that the oppressors are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to be equally involved with the </v>

266
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then secondly,</v>

267
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.510
<v Speaker 3>men having no idea why they had value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Third men who are very few men that did </v>

268
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:53.761
<v Speaker 3>study the value of being a father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how important it was to children didn't </v>

269
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 3>speak up about it and women can hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>what men don't say.</v>

270
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So we had this world then where women </v>
<v Speaker 3>were sharing the burden of a bread </v>

271
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 3>winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one was even interested in asking</v>

272
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>the question about whether men could </v>
<v Speaker 3>share the burden from women of,</v>

273
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of earning a [inaudible],</v>

274
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>providing equally for the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

275
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.740
<v Speaker 3>and women weren't even interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because there are so focused on </v>

276
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 3>their freedom and so men as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor.</v>

277
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.920
<v Speaker 3>And so there was no space to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the value of fathers and men in the </v>

278
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

279
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

280
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:29.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:33.070
<v Speaker 2>your terminology is interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're attributing the,</v>

282
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 2>the desire of the women who were pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>against what you were saying,</v>

283
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:42.040
<v Speaker 2>say you're attributing that to a desire </v>
<v Speaker 2>to freedom,</v>

284
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:47.041
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that you could easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>use irresponsibility as a terminology </v>

285
00:15:47.041 --> 00:15:47.670
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 2>because free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

287
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:54.821
<v Speaker 2>well freedom without concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the medium to longterm consequences </v>

288
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.380
<v Speaker 2>of your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're bringing in,</v>

289
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.270
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with minors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with children,</v>

290
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>that's not freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's irresponsibility.</v>

291
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:10.110
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is where we as a society have </v>

292
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 3>failed to come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

293
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

294
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.990
<v Speaker 3>whenever either sex wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a woman wins custody,</v>

295
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.600
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever either sex winds,</v>

296
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:21.910
<v Speaker 3>both sexes lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's worse than that.</v>

297
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're whenever either sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>winds,</v>

298
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.990
<v Speaker 3>both sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis.</v>

299
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of family,</v>

300
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.430
<v Speaker 3>the children lose enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also need to sort of understand </v>

301
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.230
<v Speaker 3>exactly what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that leads to children and doing so much</v>

302
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:40.580
<v Speaker 3>better when they have fathers involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

303
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I started researching that and it ended </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

304
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.590
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the boy crisis,</v>

305
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 3>ended up with more than 70 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that when children have their </v>

306
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:54.760
<v Speaker 3>father involved in about an equal way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they do so much better than.</v>

307
00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

308
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Well it would be a lovely thing if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could detail out some of that now and </v>

309
00:16:59.880 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 2>then we'll go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

310
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.350
<v Speaker 2>the political ideological story here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

311
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.710
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's happened in </v>

312
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Ontario recently is that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

313
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.710
<v Speaker 2>our government is introduced legislation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is predicated on the idea that all </v>

314
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:20.611
<v Speaker 2>families are equal and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind that you could argue is </v>

315
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.370
<v Speaker 2>laudable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

316
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could argue it,</v>

317
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.140
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have a variety of ways of solving</v>

318
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.180
<v Speaker 2>the problem of having children and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of viable solutions to</v>

319
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:39.181
<v Speaker 2>that problem and that no one family </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizational type should be privileged</v>

320
00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:42.070
<v Speaker 2>above the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

321
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I suppose with the exception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>multi-partner marriages,</v>

322
00:17:45.401 --> 00:17:50.401
<v Speaker 2>which we still don't approve of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the problem with that as far </v>

323
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:55.491
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell is that it does appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the research that the nuclear </v>

324
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 2>family is the smallest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smallest viable unit,</v>

325
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 2>which is not to say that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>single mothers or single fathers who do </v>

326
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>an admirable job under trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>

327
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>but part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a deep problem,</v>

328
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 2>is that whenever you.</v>

329
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something as a value,</v>

330
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 2>so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

331
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.590
<v Speaker 2>we want intact families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother and father.</v>

332
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the value we're heading for </v>

333
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 2>because that seems to be best for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

334
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Then you produce a rank order of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accordance with that and the people who </v>

335
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.541
<v Speaker 2>aren't in accordance with that value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can easily make a case that they're </v>

336
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:32.541
<v Speaker 2>being discriminated against and we're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a situation in our society now where </v>

337
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 2>even if the discrimination occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

338
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 2>because of the pursuit of an admirable </v>
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>

339
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.460
<v Speaker 2>it's regarded as prejudicial and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fed by that underlying hypothesis</v>

340
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:48.651
<v Speaker 2>that was anti nuclear family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That any sort of hierarchical structure </v>

341
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:54.021
<v Speaker 2>is part of the tear radical patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that that's running </v>

342
00:18:54.021 --> 00:18:54.021
<v Speaker 2>underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

343
00:18:54.021 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>let's review if you would be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful.</v>

344
00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I think for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the many ways that it's </v>

345
00:19:01.491 --> 00:19:04.821
<v Speaker 2>necessary for children to have fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that's better and perhaps also for </v>

346
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 2>for society as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for children.</v>

347
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Children that have a lot about an equal </v>

348
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 3>or more than equal father involvement </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a number of things in common as a </v>

349
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.600
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then obviously there's reversals of this</v>

350
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.180
<v Speaker 3>and not that everyone gets this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

351
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 3>this pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the first is they're far more likely</v>

352
00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:27.580
<v Speaker 3>to have postpone gratification and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>elaborate on that a little bit more.</v>

353
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Postpone gratification is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>single most important quality to </v>

354
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:36.040
<v Speaker 3>becoming successful and becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>

355
00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:41.041
<v Speaker 3>especially being employed in a job that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has some meaning for you is one of the </v>

356
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:45.811
<v Speaker 3>most important ingredients in happiness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a sense of purpose and a sense of </v>

357
00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:51.331
<v Speaker 3>motivation and a sense of willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up in the morning and so I'm in a </v>

358
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:55.771
<v Speaker 3>little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be happy to just trace back how </v>

359
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:56.530
<v Speaker 3>that postpone gratification happens more</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a father.</v>

360
00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm really interested in hearing </v>

361
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

362
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second layer is for children that have </v>

363
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.080
<v Speaker 3>an equal amount of father involvement </v>
<v Speaker 3>are far less likely to be depressed.</v>

364
00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:11.081
<v Speaker 3>They're far less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more likely to be assertive and not </v>

365
00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:14.651
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something you usually think of </v>

366
00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:17.261
<v Speaker 3>men as being aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually the children of both girls </v>

367
00:20:17.261 --> 00:20:21.671
<v Speaker 3>and boys whose fathers are involved are </v>
<v Speaker 3>far more likely to understand the </v>

368
00:20:21.671 --> 00:20:25.661
<v Speaker 3>distinction between being assertive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being aggressive and choose </v>

369
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:25.661
<v Speaker 3>assertiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boys,</v>

370
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:28.000
<v Speaker 3>another surprising one for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

371
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:33.260
<v Speaker 3>and doing the research was finding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls who are raised with about</v>

372
00:20:33.261 --> 00:20:38.261
<v Speaker 3>an equal amount of father involvement </v>
<v Speaker 3>are far more likely to be empathetic </v>

373
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:42.760
<v Speaker 3>because I always thought of empathy </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming predominantly from moms and I'll </v>

374
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.230
<v Speaker 3>be happy to explain in a bit why it does</v>
<v Speaker 3>come more from moms,</v>

375
00:20:45.231 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 3>but why the outcome for the is not more </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy.</v>

376
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.320
<v Speaker 3>The outcome for the child is less </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy.</v>

377
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 3>So a little bit more on that later.</v>

378
00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Far more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both boys and girls should drop out of </v>

379
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there isn't far father involvement,</v>

380
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm far more likely when a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a,</v>

381
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.240
<v Speaker 3>when a relationship breaks up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

382
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.470
<v Speaker 3>a child that has not had significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>father involvement is much more likely </v>

383
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 3>to be depressed and be withdrawn and b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel alienated.</v>

384
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm far more likely to be addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>video games,</v>

385
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 3>far more likely to be addicted to video </v>
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

386
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm far more likely to have few social </v>
<v Speaker 3>skills,</v>

387
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 3>few emotional skills to do worse in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every academic area,</v>

388
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:33.030
<v Speaker 3>but especially in reading and writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the two biggest predictors of </v>

389
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 3>success are far more likely to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower sperm count have.</v>

390
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's an amazing thing.</v>

391
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:42.961
<v Speaker 3>I just discovered toward the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>research for the boy crisis I saw in </v>

392
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:47.701
<v Speaker 3>pediatrics magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that children who by the age of nine</v>

393
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 3>don't have a significant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>father involvement.</v>

394
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Both girls and boys are likely to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>shorter telomeres.</v>

395
00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And as most of us know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the telomeres are pivotal in predicting </v>

396
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 3>life expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So boys and girls,</v>

397
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:08.851
<v Speaker 3>the average shorter telomeres for a nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old boy or girl without father </v>

398
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 3>involvement was 14 percent a w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

399
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:18.001
<v Speaker 3>It was a 14 percent shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the boys tell it mirrors were then </v>

400
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent shorter than the girls.</v>

401
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:27.450
<v Speaker 3>So here this was predicting about a 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent shorter life expectancy for the </v>

402
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 3>average child without father involvement</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the age of nine already.</v>

403
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.070
<v Speaker 3>And yet the boys were suffering more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So two things fascinated me.</v>

404
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.310
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

405
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 3>all the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 3>dropping out of school and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

407
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe this is because boys with </v>

408
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 3>father involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just have better,</v>

409
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better neighborhoods.</v>

410
00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

411
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father's earned more,</v>

412
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:57.211
<v Speaker 3>the families are more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a matter of poverty versus </v>

413
00:22:57.211 --> 00:22:57.211
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>

414
00:22:57.211 --> 00:23:00.660
<v Speaker 3>So I started looking at a boys and girls</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up in and good quote,</v>

415
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:05.911
<v Speaker 3>good neighborhoods with good schools and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparing them with boys and girls </v>

416
00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:09.691
<v Speaker 3>growing up in poor neighborhoods in poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools and found that the boys and </v>

417
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:15.061
<v Speaker 3>girls growing up in good neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 3>with poor schools that did not have </v>

418
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:19.080
<v Speaker 3>significant father involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did about the same as boys and girls </v>

419
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 3>growing up in poor neighborhoods with </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor schools that did have father </v>

420
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That father involvement was really as,</v>

421
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.420
<v Speaker 3>as good a predictor of success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

422
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.550
<v Speaker 3>as the quality of the school system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of the neighborhood and the </v>

423
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what's led to,</v>

424
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

425
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 3>to the psychologist I'm gathering </v>
<v Speaker 3>together behind people like worship 100 </v>

426
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 3>psychologists and researchers saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 3>this is not a correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The involvement of father,</v>

428
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 3>this is not a matter of socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

429
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 3>This is a matter of actual father's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>father's,</v>

430
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 3>father's involvement.</v>

431
00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Especially the biological father's </v>
<v Speaker 3>involvement actually makes a significant</v>

432
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:05.801
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have been wrong about the assumption </v>

433
00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:05.801
<v Speaker 3>that this was probably just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>

434
00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:10.690
<v Speaker 3>And so the more I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I found just every nightmare of</v>

435
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 3>a parent to be so increased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

436
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 3>when there was not a significant amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of father involvement.</v>

437
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.450
<v Speaker 3>And I was seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was dating between before I married </v>

438
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.400
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman you just met just before we </v>

439
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 3>got on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we got married 14 years ago,</v>

440
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was dating a number of women.</v>

441
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Almost every woman had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a single mother,</v>

442
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.660
<v Speaker 3>and these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single woman was working her rear </v>

443
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.171
<v Speaker 3>off line to balance her life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every woman used the word overwhelmed by</v>

444
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.710
<v Speaker 3>the way she felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

445
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every woman said,</v>

446
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like my dad and the dad involved,</v>

447
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when the.</v>

448
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.640
<v Speaker 3>But I started listening to the butts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the women and then listening to men who </v>

449
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:59.951
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be more involved with their </v>

450
00:24:59.951 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 3>children and listening to what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences were between what the Mit,</v>

451
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 3>what made the men feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not wanted,</v>

452
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.950
<v Speaker 3>what made the men feel excluded and why </v>
<v Speaker 3>the women felt that they needed to not </v>

453
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 3>have the man involved.</v>

454
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And I saw this entire set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstandings here and if I hope the</v>

455
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 3>boy crisis does anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just sort of explained,</v>

456
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here are the 10 major things that Dad's </v>

457
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.621
<v Speaker 3>do that that's sort of a noi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women or make women feel that they're </v>

458
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 3>not protecting their children </v>
<v Speaker 3>adequately.</v>

459
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Which when they understand the purpose </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these things and dads get their </v>

460
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.010
<v Speaker 3>homework done enough to articulate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moms the purpose of these things </v>

461
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.840
<v Speaker 3>that will realize that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these are necessary ingredients in </v>

462
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:43.840
<v Speaker 3>a child's life.</v>

463
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good,</v>

464
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a good place to go next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you laid out a whole slew of reasons,</v>

465
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:55.020
<v Speaker 2>a slew of consequences of fatherlessness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and will return back to the causal </v>

466
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 2>relationship between men do and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial outcomes.</v>

467
00:25:57.921 --> 00:26:02.921
<v Speaker 2>But if you could go on now to tell us </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is that men are doing at a micro</v>

468
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:08.201
<v Speaker 2>level than we could return to the causal</v>
<v Speaker 2>link between that and not positive </v>

469
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 2>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said that those also caused some</v>

470
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.060
<v Speaker 2>contention in the household?</v>

471
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give one example of,</v>

472
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:18.451
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be I'm a father is rough housing </v>

473
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:22.871
<v Speaker 3>with the kids and the moms looking over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying looking askance and thinking,</v>

474
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when should I interfere?</v>

475
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.010
<v Speaker 3>When should I not interfere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the mom saying to herself,</v>

476
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

477
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please keep the kids away from the,</v>

478
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:34.800
<v Speaker 3>the Credenza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are paid the kids away from the the</v>

479
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.660
<v Speaker 3>couch because they could hit their head </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

480
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have they to tomorrow when you can take </v>

481
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.270
<v Speaker 3>this outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel much safer the kids,</v>

482
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.890
<v Speaker 3>and then the mother is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hesitating to not be overly controlling </v>

483
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.660
<v Speaker 3>and yet at the same time she's feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>she has to monitor the husband as well </v>

484
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.311
<v Speaker 3>as monitor the husband with the kids and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's feeling in the back of her mind </v>

485
00:26:58.311 --> 00:26:59.880
<v Speaker 3>like I sooner or later that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

486
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.280
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be an accident here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be upset with myself for </v>

487
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 3>not being stricter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the other hand,</v>

488
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.870
<v Speaker 3>the kids seem to be having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I should let things go.</v>

489
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:14.431
<v Speaker 2>there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a cycle biologist named Jaak </v>

491
00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp who was one of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great biological psychologists and he </v>

492
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.840
<v Speaker 2>studied rough and tumble play in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

493
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.240
<v Speaker 2>So rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

494
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>a huge part of the socialization process</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's key to the development of the </v>

495
00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:32.440
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cortex in juvenile male </v>
<v Speaker 2>routes in particular emerges and matures</v>

496
00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:34.360
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

497
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And one of the amazing things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp discovered it,</v>

498
00:27:37.451 --> 00:27:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and this truly is an amazing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

499
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

500
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>if you pair two rats together and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them play repeated bouts,</v>

501
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.510
<v Speaker 2>the big rat will dominate the little rap</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with in the first bout.</v>

502
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 2>But if the big rat doesn't let the </v>
<v Speaker 2>little rat win about 30 percent of the </v>

503
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.220
<v Speaker 2>time in repeated play boats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the little rat won't play anymore.</v>

504
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>So you get an emergent morality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent play centered morality even </v>

505
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.990
<v Speaker 2>among rats as a consequence of rough and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tumble play.</v>

506
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:13.420
<v Speaker 2>And that rough and tumble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a fair bit of research on rough </v>

507
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 2>and tumble play about all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably 20 years ago now,</v>

508
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:18.811
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really quite clear that rough </v>

509
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:22.621
<v Speaker 2>and tumble play helps children </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameterize their bodies so that they </v>

510
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:23.470
<v Speaker 2>know how they extend and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

511
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:28.490
<v Speaker 2>and also what limits there isn't the use</v>
<v Speaker 2>of physical interactions with another </v>

512
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:29.500
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's fun,</v>

513
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.380
<v Speaker 2>what's provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's pushing it too far,</v>

514
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.490
<v Speaker 2>what's painful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course kids love rough and tumble</v>

515
00:28:36.491 --> 00:28:39.580
<v Speaker 2>play as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just absolutely starving for it.</v>

516
00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:43.150
<v Speaker 2>And we've squeezed it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten is the nursery schools,</v>

517
00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the elementary schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the junior high schools,</v>

518
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.080
<v Speaker 2>all of that and for and for bid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Panksepp also found was that if</v>

519
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you deprived juvenile routes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the opportunity to engage in active</v>

520
00:28:54.341 --> 00:28:59.341
<v Speaker 2>rough and tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they showed symptoms that were </v>

521
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:02.770
<v Speaker 2>broadly analogous to those have </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention deficit disorder in human boys</v>

522
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.040
<v Speaker 2>and that you could also treat that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ritalin the same way in routes as you </v>

523
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.040
<v Speaker 2>could with boys.</v>

524
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.420
<v Speaker 2>So there's that rough and tumble play </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

525
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you might think to the question is </v>

526
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>one question is why might a mother be </v>
<v Speaker 2>distrustful of the rough and tumble play</v>

527
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 2>episode?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of that might be sensitivity </v>

528
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But huge part of that also was trust on </v>

529
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.550
<v Speaker 2>her trust with regards to the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:29:30.551 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 2>because it's rambunctious and noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if she trusts,</v>

531
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.440
<v Speaker 2>let's say that that act of masculinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that plays rough,</v>

532
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.200
<v Speaker 2>then she'll stay away and let the fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

533
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 2>But if there's distrust running through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>

534
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:47.410
<v Speaker 2>then then she'll stand between the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the father.</v>

535
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:52.411
<v Speaker 2>And then he won't get to involve himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way and then he'll turn off and </v>

536
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

537
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>many families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

538
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 2>So there's rough and tumble play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

539
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else do you see?</v>

540
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Let me take the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The evolution of how rough and tumble </v>

541
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.480
<v Speaker 3>play goes in all the dimensions of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery slope that it leads to.</v>

542
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.010
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father,</v>

543
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 3>the what the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the mom or the dad knew is that </v>

544
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.280
<v Speaker 3>this rough and tumble play leads to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of things that you just mentioned,</v>

545
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 3>but you're also evident in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.730
<v Speaker 3>an elephants and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also leads to the distinction </v>

547
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.291
<v Speaker 3>between a child being able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between being assertive </v>

548
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:26.291
<v Speaker 3>versus aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the.</v>

549
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.860
<v Speaker 3>So the kid starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

550
00:30:27.861 --> 00:30:32.861
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm kicking the dad and the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>place or poking the data and the eyes </v>

551
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:33.980
<v Speaker 3>are pulling the dad's hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the dad says,</v>

552
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can fake.</v>

553
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.080
<v Speaker 3>You can fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I contacted the left and then move to </v>

554
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.080
<v Speaker 3>the right to win in this wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>

555
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Or you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

556
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:42.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do this,</v>

557
00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:46.610
<v Speaker 3>this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't do these things and if you</v>

558
00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.950
<v Speaker 3>do do these things will stop the rough </v>
<v Speaker 3>housing.</v>

559
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there.</v>

560
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.730
<v Speaker 2>So there is a really important issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

561
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 2>So two things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that.</v>

562
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that a rough and tumbled boat is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dance.</v>

563
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point of the dances so that both</v>

564
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:06.241
<v Speaker 2>people are having a good time while it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening because otherwise it's not </v>

565
00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:09.961
<v Speaker 2>play right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as either party is no </v>

566
00:31:09.961 --> 00:31:11.030
<v Speaker 2>longer having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've actually snapped out of the cycle</v>

567
00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:16.031
<v Speaker 2>biological function of the play circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you're telling the </v>

568
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:20.041
<v Speaker 2>child by putting those rules on is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can interact physically within a very </v>

569
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:24.871
<v Speaker 2>limited set of parameters and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to learn to do is to be sophist</v>

570
00:31:24.961 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 2>as sophisticated player within that set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of parameters.</v>

571
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 2>And you want to learn how to push the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries,</v>

572
00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:34.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the most fun rough and tumble </v>

573
00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:35.560
<v Speaker 2>play is right on the edge between </v>
<v Speaker 2>assertiveness and aggression.</v>

574
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see kids,</v>

575
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 2>like I used to work in daycare centers </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid when I was 18,</v>

576
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.790
<v Speaker 2>19 and the kids would line up to rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tumble play with me because that was</v>

577
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 2>still allowable then and they were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate for it,</v>

578
00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:52.861
<v Speaker 2>it was just ridiculous and I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>really tell the difference between the </v>

579
00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:57.181
<v Speaker 2>kids who had engaged in that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>play and the ones that hadn't and the </v>

580
00:31:57.181 --> 00:32:00.871
<v Speaker 2>ones that hadn't were painfully awkward </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would hurt themselves and you,</v>

581
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 2>when you wrestled with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put their thumb in your eye or.</v>

582
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And they would cry often too when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got surprised but not hurt,</v>

583
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they couldn't tell the </v>

584
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:13.700
<v Speaker 2>difference between just being startled </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being hurt.</v>

585
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.120
<v Speaker 2>And so they were fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that also made them not fun to play </v>

586
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.211
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so interesting </v>

587
00:32:21.211 --> 00:32:23.551
<v Speaker 2>about that too is piaget talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this when he talked about the </v>

588
00:32:23.551 --> 00:32:24.080
<v Speaker 2>development of children is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the more sophisticated pretend play and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then sophisticated cognitive play that </v>

590
00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:35.011
<v Speaker 2>emerges say between five and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with the cognitive play older </v>

591
00:32:35.011 --> 00:32:39.121
<v Speaker 2>than that is that unless you have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying cycle motor embodied dance </v>

592
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:45.011
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to really proceed in a </v>

593
00:32:45.011 --> 00:32:48.551
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated way to those higher levels</v>
<v Speaker 2>of play because other people don't want </v>

594
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 2>to play with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the rough and tumble play,</v>

595
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:53.090
<v Speaker 2>the importance of that can hardly be </v>
<v Speaker 2>overstated.</v>

596
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

597
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.990
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the framework here is that when you </v>

598
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 3>set up a system where you said that men </v>
<v Speaker 3>are part of the patriarchy,</v>

599
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:01.750
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

600
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.760
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their desire is to dominate women and </v>

601
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 3>make rules to benefit the expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefit men at the expense of women.</v>

602
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 3>You have a framework or an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>setting which does not,</v>

603
00:33:13.431 --> 00:33:18.431
<v Speaker 3>is not conducive men saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my value or women's saying,</v>

604
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.650
<v Speaker 3>let me see what the checks and balances </v>
<v Speaker 3>of parenting is that leads to the best </v>

605
00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 3>of you coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the best of me coming out,</v>

606
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:30.610
<v Speaker 3>all of that has sort of skipped over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherent sense of father knows best to </v>

607
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 3>father knows less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

608
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

609
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.120
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

610
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process that I'll be sharing in a </v>

611
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 3>moment of what rough housing leads to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the slippery slope that happens when</v>

612
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:45.430
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

613
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.500
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what is not even been nurtured as a </v>

614
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.670
<v Speaker 3>possibility to be articulated in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture at the.</v>

615
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I also think too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:33:53.191 --> 00:33:57.750
<v Speaker 2>that if you have a partner who hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been played with,</v>

617
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 2>then that partner can't tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between Boisterous </v>

618
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.851
<v Speaker 2>rambunctiousness and aggression and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hypothesis about domination </v>

619
00:34:08.251 --> 00:34:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and the patriarchy running its course </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath that,</v>

620
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 2>then there's going to be conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion about the physical </v>

621
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.401
<v Speaker 2>interactions that have the appearance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>submission and dominance because that's </v>

622
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:22.180
<v Speaker 2>part of the rough housing play routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

623
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:27.210
<v Speaker 2>that is going to be viewed through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lens of tyrannical interaction rather </v>

624
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.341
<v Speaker 2>than just good fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can tell the difference </v>

625
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.610
<v Speaker 2>because if the kids are rough and tumble</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

626
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:37.650
<v Speaker 2>they're unbelievably enthusiastic about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and engaged and laughing and giggling</v>

627
00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:41.070
<v Speaker 2>and like they'll play right to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>of exhaustion because they need it.</v>

628
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They need it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a hard thing to observe from </v>

629
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.680
<v Speaker 2>the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not accustomed to that,</v>

630
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't have that framework of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>

631
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.930
<v Speaker 3>of men having a dad's having a value to </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with,</v>

632
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:54.550
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>

633
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.580
<v Speaker 3>here's maybe what might bring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be helpful for a mom to understand that </v>

634
00:34:59.741 --> 00:35:04.741
<v Speaker 3>the rough and tumble play we now know </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps children distinguished between </v>

635
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:10.171
<v Speaker 3>being assertive and aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a number of other things off also </v>

636
00:35:10.171 --> 00:35:13.921
<v Speaker 3>happened during that play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a bond that is created between </v>

637
00:35:13.921 --> 00:35:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the father and the child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in almost every I've been doing </v>

638
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.810
<v Speaker 3>expert witness work to help children </v>
<v Speaker 3>have both parents.</v>

639
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:24.811
<v Speaker 3>You have to divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've observed more than 50 families and </v>

640
00:35:24.811 --> 00:35:27.781
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and usually the father interacting with </v>

641
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:27.781
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the children.</v>

642
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:28.450
<v Speaker 3>And in almost every case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every case,</v>

643
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I try believe that I have seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

644
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.600
<v Speaker 3>this bond is used by the father to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like,</v>

645
00:35:34.601 --> 00:35:36.820
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we no more rough housing.</v>

646
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Now tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your homework done.</v>

647
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 3>You get your chores done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get all ready for bed,</v>

648
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 3>brush teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth,</v>

649
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.460
<v Speaker 3>brush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

650
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.310
<v Speaker 3>and the bedtime is 9:00.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you get all that done,</v>

651
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 3>we'll have between the time you get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>done and the time of 9:00</v>

652
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 3>in order for you to have some more fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>either with rough housing or reading my </v>

653
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 3>favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite story or whatever.</v>

654
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your choice.</v>

655
00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know with,</v>

656
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 2>with Panksepp's work too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found that the little rats,</v>

657
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:07.870
<v Speaker 2>the rats will work to enter a play arena</v>
<v Speaker 2>because because play,</v>

658
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.510
<v Speaker 2>you think play is a so panksepp </v>
<v Speaker 2>established very,</v>

659
00:36:11.511 --> 00:36:15.260
<v Speaker 2>very clearly that there is a primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>place circuit in mammals.</v>

660
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a separate cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological circuit.</v>

661
00:36:17.391 --> 00:36:22.391
<v Speaker 2>It's not exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole different motivational </v>

662
00:36:22.391 --> 00:36:23.900
<v Speaker 2>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the activity in that circuit is</v>

663
00:36:23.901 --> 00:36:28.901
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically pleasurable and part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that appears to be because it's so key </v>

664
00:36:28.901 --> 00:36:33.461
<v Speaker 2>to proper socialization that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's regarded by my children and by </v>

665
00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:39.221
<v Speaker 2>social mammals as intrinsically valuable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it makes perfect sense that that </v>

666
00:36:39.221 --> 00:36:40.610
<v Speaker 2>can be used as a source of primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>

667
00:36:40.611 --> 00:36:45.611
<v Speaker 2>And I think your comments about the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and the kids binding themselves </v>

668
00:36:46.641 --> 00:36:49.460
<v Speaker 2>together through play is also really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important because one of the things that</v>

669
00:36:49.461 --> 00:36:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I do with young man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I think young men tend to be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>alienated from infants who are under </v>

671
00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.641
<v Speaker 2>about nine months old because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really equipped to know what the </v>

672
00:37:00.641 --> 00:37:00.641
<v Speaker 2>hell to do with them.</v>

673
00:37:00.641 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can learn and they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at it,</v>

674
00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:06.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's not their domain of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise.</v>

675
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.440
<v Speaker 2>But once a kid hits about nine months </v>
<v Speaker 2>and starts to be able to imitate and to </v>

676
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.611
<v Speaker 2>pound end to end to play and to respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>to gentle teasing like that's a perfect </v>

677
00:37:15.891 --> 00:37:20.891
<v Speaker 2>time for the father to swoop in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just very helpful for a mother by the </v>

678
00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:24.371
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to have another child and to </v>

679
00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:26.471
<v Speaker 2>start really cementing a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's based on that interest in </v>

680
00:37:26.471 --> 00:37:29.630
<v Speaker 2>combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of high energy fun.</v>

681
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Plus the disciplined interactions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are necessary as a precursor to that.</v>

682
00:37:35.241 --> 00:37:40.241
<v Speaker 2>And if you interfere with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you stop the farther from being </v>

683
00:37:40.241 --> 00:37:41.150
<v Speaker 2>able to form that pro from liking his </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

684
00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

685
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:44.200
<v Speaker 2>because that's how the liking comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is,</v>

686
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 2>is through play and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crucial.</v>

687
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:48.860
<v Speaker 2>It's crucial significance.</v>

688
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thank you.</v>

689
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:51.430
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

690
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the additional framework that you're </v>

691
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:56.600
<v Speaker 3>placing on this has really deepened my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own understanding of the</v>

692
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience written by Jaak Panksepp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on my reading list on my website </v>

693
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 2>because he lays out the findings from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal literature on the primary </v>

694
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:10.390
<v Speaker 2>place circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

695
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:15.530
<v Speaker 2>he should have won a Nobel prize for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean discovering an entirely new </v>

696
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.060
<v Speaker 2>motivational system in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major,</v>

697
00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:22.061
<v Speaker 2>major contribution and to also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that he did that was so </v>

698
00:38:22.061 --> 00:38:25.961
<v Speaker 2>cool and sort of reminded me of John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget's work a little bit is he made a </v>

699
00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:30.341
<v Speaker 2>very strong case that out of play </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges an ethic and you know that.</v>

700
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:36.791
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was so interested when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned that interactions father </v>

701
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:39.260
<v Speaker 2>actually increase empathy because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

702
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>if someone has empathy for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that,</v>

703
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that can lead to a certain kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of narcissism,</v>

704
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:50.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're always the center of </v>

705
00:38:50.611 --> 00:38:51.931
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not empathic unless you learn </v>

706
00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:54.660
<v Speaker 2>that you're not any more important than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next person and particularly the </v>

707
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 2>person that you happen to be playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

708
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

709
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 2>so let's continue with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what fathers are doing.</v>

710
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

711
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.690
<v Speaker 3>So in that rough housing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that the bond that is </v>

712
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.970
<v Speaker 3>created by the dad allows the dad to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

713
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's will continue the rough housing </v>

714
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.030
<v Speaker 3>if you get between 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nine,</v>

715
00:39:14.031 --> 00:39:15.470
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have everything done,</v>

716
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so that the child learns to postpone</v>

717
00:39:19.221 --> 00:39:24.221
<v Speaker 3>gratification from doing the what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves to do right then and there that is</v>

718
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.220
<v Speaker 3>the rough house with and deal with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to deal with before it gets more </v>

719
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.270
<v Speaker 3>of what it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

720
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:32.700
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

721
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.380
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

722
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder if there's been any,</v>

723
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:42.510
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See we don't know much about the origin </v>

724
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>of the trait conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is at least in part,</v>

725
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:48.010
<v Speaker 2>the ability to delay gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is after intelligence.</v>

726
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 2>It's the best predictor of longterm life</v>
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>

727
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:55.321
<v Speaker 2>especially in managerial and </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative jobs and algorithmic </v>

728
00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:55.321
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not associated with creativity,</v>

729
00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a side issue.</v>

730
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:02.310
<v Speaker 2>So your hypothesis is that the primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>way men are socializing that is by using</v>

731
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 2>work to play as a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>

732
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.030
<v Speaker 2>as a bridge,</v>

733
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.760
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

734
00:40:07.761 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that play creates a bond.</v>

735
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:13.730
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of the problem is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when moms often say,</v>

736
00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do this,</v>

737
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do this,</v>

738
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:21.121
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mother is often experienced by the </v>

739
00:40:21.121 --> 00:40:24.010
<v Speaker 3>child has sort of the disciplinarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's always making him or her do things</v>

740
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.040
<v Speaker 3>and there's a seeds of rebellion start </v>
<v Speaker 3>to occur of sort of like how much am I </v>

741
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.030
<v Speaker 3>going to be myself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much am I going to do what mom does?</v>

742
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Do I want to be a mama's boy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it doesn't even have to know.</v>

743
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 3>You're just sort of feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being pushed down by all the rules.</v>

744
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 3>But with dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bone that is,</v>

745
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 3>or moms who rough house with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

746
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.070
<v Speaker 3>a bond is created and from the end and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to return to that,</v>

747
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 3>that connection.</v>

748
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:52.140
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a child going on a </v>

749
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.140
<v Speaker 3>rollercoaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

750
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an enormous amount of safety but</v>

751
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.400
<v Speaker 3>you also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and excitement,</v>

752
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:59.401
<v Speaker 3>but it also an enormous amount of safety</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you trust the data to combine </v>

753
00:40:59.401 --> 00:41:00.490
<v Speaker 3>that both and you want to return to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

754
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 3>So you're willing to focus on getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>done what you need to do your homework,</v>

755
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:06.580
<v Speaker 3>your chores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brush,</v>

756
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.640
<v Speaker 3>his teeth or whatever in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want to do,</v>

757
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

758
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 3>of postpone gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now let's take the slippery slope </v>

759
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 3>when this doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

760
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me,</v>

761
00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:19.100
<v Speaker 2>let me just add one more thing to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

762
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's so cool about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've also provided a really </v>

763
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:24.890
<v Speaker 2>intelligent piece of parenting advice </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

764
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.420
<v Speaker 2>for fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

765
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.000
<v Speaker 2>because you're so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say bf skinner,</v>

766
00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:34.001
<v Speaker 2>who was the famous animal behaviorist </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated quite clearly that you </v>

767
00:41:34.001 --> 00:41:38.351
<v Speaker 2>could train animals with reward more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively than with threat or </v>

768
00:41:38.351 --> 00:41:38.351
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

769
00:41:38.351 --> 00:41:43.061
<v Speaker 2>threat or punishment is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we wouldn't have biological </v>

770
00:41:43.061 --> 00:41:47.351
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subserving those emotions if they </v>

771
00:41:47.351 --> 00:41:49.391
<v Speaker 2>weren't necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but but reward is harder to use because </v>

772
00:41:49.391 --> 00:41:53.351
<v Speaker 2>you have to be much more attentive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervene when something good happens </v>

773
00:41:53.351 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 2>and so you really have to be watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your hypothesis here is look,</v>

774
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:01.810
<v Speaker 2>father's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend a bunch of time playing with your </v>

775
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.961
<v Speaker 2>kids and having as much fun as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them because I formulating that </v>

776
00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 2>bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use that as a,</v>

777
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 2>as the source of reward that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciated by the child with regards to</v>

778
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:12.790
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

779
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

780
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a twofold victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is it's fun and you get to like your</v>

781
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:22.061
<v Speaker 2>kids and have a good time with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the second is you have a very </v>

782
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 2>positive means of disciplining them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best sense,</v>

783
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 2>encouraging them and disciplining them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

784
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a really useful thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>product</v>

785
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 3>thickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So deepening the trust to the kids like </v>

786
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're playing and you're right on </v>

787
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.031
<v Speaker 3>the edge that you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's dad to make sure that the </v>

788
00:42:39.031 --> 00:42:40.510
<v Speaker 3>fund doesn't get too hard for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him,</v>

789
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:46.020
<v Speaker 3>for your sister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on and so that that's all </v>

790
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.840
<v Speaker 3>happening at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when the right and that's embodied,</v>

791
00:42:46.841 --> 00:42:49.270
<v Speaker 3>you can see that two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's embodied trust.</v>

792
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.940
<v Speaker 3>So if you toss a little kid up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air and catch them,</v>

793
00:42:51.941 --> 00:42:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very exciting to them both </v>
<v Speaker 3>being tossed up because of the threat,</v>

794
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:59.830
<v Speaker 3>but then the relief that occurs because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the safety that's put in there,</v>

795
00:42:59.831 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 3>so it's not abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really demonstrated.</v>

796
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.170
<v Speaker 3>And then our dad taught you that child </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and,</v>

797
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.650
<v Speaker 3>and then in fact missing the child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote,</v>

798
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>and the child lands on the bed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't like,</v>

799
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was missed.</v>

800
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 3>You going to catch me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also recognizing as well that shows </v>

801
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.550
<v Speaker 3>that that shows that things can happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't entirely what you predict,</v>

802
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.280
<v Speaker 3>but within the confines of a trusting </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

803
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.490
<v Speaker 3>that's still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you could also imagine if the,</v>

804
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.820
<v Speaker 3>if the dad is wrestling with more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>one kid at the same time,</v>

805
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:35.050
<v Speaker 3>then he's also acting as just referee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

806
00:43:35.051 --> 00:43:40.051
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the kids learn how to be </v>

807
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:40.180
<v Speaker 3>judicious in the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

808
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.070
<v Speaker 3>They learn how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair,</v>

809
00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:47.310
<v Speaker 3>they learn how everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how everybody can have a turn and </v>

810
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.101
<v Speaker 3>everybody wins out the same time and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that bonding is what is part of what</v>

811
00:43:51.491 --> 00:43:54.850
<v Speaker 3>creates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything you just said is part of</v>

812
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:57.100
<v Speaker 3>what leads the child to have empathy </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

813
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And the empathy training came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

814
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.130
<v Speaker 3>you were too rough on your sister there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you try it again,</v>

815
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you can't be that rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

816
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.720
<v Speaker 3>you still continue to be that rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

817
00:44:07.721 --> 00:44:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Let's no more play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

818
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Play stops when everyone isn't having </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

819
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:12.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

820
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.600
<v Speaker 2>My kids were little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this couch that was a sectional </v>

821
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.891
<v Speaker 2>in six pieces and so we could put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>couches facing each other and then we </v>

822
00:44:22.891 --> 00:44:23.770
<v Speaker 2>put up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

823
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.400
<v Speaker 2>the backs all the way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a little wrestling rate.</v>

824
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.830
<v Speaker 2>And so then I would take the kids in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and just wrestle them half to </v>

825
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:32.830
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

826
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:36.410
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things I used to do was </v>
<v Speaker 2>if one of the kids was rough with the </v>

827
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 2>other and made them cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I noticed that the kid who made the</v>

828
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:44.100
<v Speaker 2>other kid cry wouldn't look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying kid.</v>

829
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 2>They look away and avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I always used to say,</v>

830
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

831
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look,</v>

832
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you look and you see what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>

833
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.940
<v Speaker 2>that triggers that embodied empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can easily have a </v>

834
00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:57.940
<v Speaker 2>conversation and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

835
00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how you want the game to go or </v>

836
00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 2>do you want everybody to have fun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

837
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:08.451
<v Speaker 2>once the kid actually looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they've got it right because they </v>

838
00:45:08.451 --> 00:45:09.750
<v Speaker 2>can't escape from that empathic </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification.</v>

839
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:10.890
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

840
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the child doesn't have that said,</v>

841
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 3>we have all this data now these 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas where children do so </v>

842
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.460
<v Speaker 3>much worse when they don't have a father</v>
<v Speaker 3>involvement.</v>

843
00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:23.840
<v Speaker 3>So let's look at the next stage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

844
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that father does not do this </v>

845
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.280
<v Speaker 3>roughhousing housing and as just one </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of many and um,</v>

846
00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and does not as not enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries,</v>

847
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.120
<v Speaker 3>the child then doesn't learn to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that postpone gratification.</v>

848
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.980
<v Speaker 3>So we have hard data on this that </v>
<v Speaker 3>children grow.</v>

849
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Children raised predominantly by dads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are only 15 percent likely to have adhd,</v>

850
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.000
<v Speaker 3>children raised predominantly by moms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 30 percent likely to have adhd.</v>

851
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.130
<v Speaker 3>So if we looked at what we just talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

852
00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 3>the children that are raised by the dads</v>
<v Speaker 3>are learning that they have to postpone </v>

853
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.170
<v Speaker 3>that gratification you see in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the reward that they want.</v>

854
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Now you take that capacity to postpone </v>
<v Speaker 3>gratification to school.</v>

855
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.080
<v Speaker 3>The child without postpone gratification</v>
<v Speaker 3>assigned a homework assignment,</v>

856
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:13.360
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is oftentimes distracted by a text </v>

857
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:13.750
<v Speaker 3>that's come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted by,</v>

858
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:18.751
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity to play video games </v>

859
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:19.840
<v Speaker 3>distracted by wanting to exchange notes </v>
<v Speaker 3>with other kids is distracted,</v>

860
00:46:19.841 --> 00:46:20.260
<v Speaker 3>distracted.</v>

861
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

862
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:26.260
<v Speaker 2>If the distraction thing about the disc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to explain adhd.</v>

863
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.580
<v Speaker 2>What there is a need to do is to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>why every kid doesn't have it.</v>

864
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer that you just laid out is </v>

865
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.640
<v Speaker 2>that some kids learn how to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>their district.</v>

866
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Distractability doesn't require an </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation because people are </v>

867
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:42.310
<v Speaker 2>distracted by what's immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewarding.</v>

868
00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't require an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like addiction.</v>

869
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction doesn't require explanation </v>

870
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.871
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What requires explanation is the </v>

871
00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:54.601
<v Speaker 2>development of the resources that allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to withstand addictive pressures in </v>

872
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:55.270
<v Speaker 2>the face of the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

873
00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.100
<v Speaker 2>they're everywhere and they're powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

874
00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's development of control.</v>

875
00:47:00.011 --> 00:47:02.170
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really the curious issue.</v>

876
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And I've never heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard anyone make this </v>

877
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.450
<v Speaker 2>connection between the use of play as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>

878
00:47:10.451 --> 00:47:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And that delay of gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a very,</v>

879
00:47:12.461 --> 00:47:14.800
<v Speaker 2>very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>

880
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 3>And then let me take it another step </v>
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>

881
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 3>So when this delayed gratification is </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening or does not happen,</v>

882
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and then the boy isn't able to finish </v>
<v Speaker 3>homework,</v>

883
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 3>he started speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning to feel ashamed of themselves,</v>

884
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.560
<v Speaker 3>or if he's athletic and his parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that it's really going to be </v>

885
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.760
<v Speaker 3>helpful to the child to have beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>

886
00:47:35.761 --> 00:47:40.761
<v Speaker 3>Sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be an NBA player and you're </v>

887
00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:40.761
<v Speaker 3>tall and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you continue practicing.</v>

888
00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:42.480
<v Speaker 3>You can be an NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBA player,</v>

889
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you can have your dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have that postpone </v>

890
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.791
<v Speaker 3>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So cannot do the boring repetition that </v>

891
00:47:50.791 --> 00:47:55.021
<v Speaker 3>comes with all success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including being an Olympic star or an </v>

892
00:47:55.021 --> 00:47:55.070
<v Speaker 3>NBA player or anything else</v>

893
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.470
<v Speaker 2>playing the piano or learning to read or</v>

894
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.830
<v Speaker 3>great example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly the violin.</v>

895
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you,</v>

896
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.840
<v Speaker 3>so anything that is his dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the dream,</v>

897
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:10.841
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the disappointment and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just disappointment that he fears </v>

898
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 3>will happen to his parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

899
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.280
<v Speaker 3>but also the sense that he says he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna do one thing in school.</v>

900
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.290
<v Speaker 3>His P,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his teachers,</v>

901
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.380
<v Speaker 3>his peers are not respecting him as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

902
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

903
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cheerleaders aren't going first and </v>

904
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.071
<v Speaker 3>10 and a concussion again to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it to somebody else at </v>

905
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 3>first and do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The um,</v>

906
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.250
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boy is beginning to feel shame.</v>

907
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

908
00:48:34.801 --> 00:48:36.000
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think shape.</v>

909
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Look here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the precondition for shame.</v>

910
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:43.790
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that you are attracted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal naturally.</v>

911
00:48:43.861 --> 00:48:46.170
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's scaffolded by your parents,</v>

912
00:48:46.171 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's scaffolded by your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that you're naturally</v>

913
00:48:49.711 --> 00:48:52.440
<v Speaker 2>turning your attention towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It grips you in some sense.</v>

914
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and we'll assume that it's a </v>

915
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.901
<v Speaker 2>difficult goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then there's an ethic that </v>

916
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:02.871
<v Speaker 2>emerges out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that if that goal is valuable </v>

917
00:49:02.871 --> 00:49:06.231
<v Speaker 2>and it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's sacrifices that have to be </v>

918
00:49:06.231 --> 00:49:09.201
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delays of gratification that have to be </v>

919
00:49:09.201 --> 00:49:10.470
<v Speaker 2>implemented in order for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthy to attain that goal.</v>

920
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all part of the game.</v>

921
00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:17.691
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it as a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then then if you observe yourself </v>

922
00:49:17.691 --> 00:49:20.400
<v Speaker 2>unable to play the rules of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play by the rules,</v>

923
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 2>then how can you not have any?</v>

924
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:27.200
<v Speaker 2>How can you not suffer shame and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>contempt because you've already adopted </v>

925
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.120
<v Speaker 2>an ethical framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this is worth attaining.</v>

926
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:35.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you observe in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the inability to attain it because </v>

927
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:39.171
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly being distracted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to have contempt for </v>

928
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way out of that.</v>

929
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:47.370
<v Speaker 2>This is something I learned from nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the terrible thing about that </v>

930
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.130
<v Speaker 2>because that's a great pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denial isn't because let's say you pause</v>

931
00:49:50.131 --> 00:49:55.131
<v Speaker 2>it for goals in succession that you find</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable and then you observe yourself </v>

932
00:49:55.561 --> 00:50:00.561
<v Speaker 2>unable to discipline yourself to attain </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goals while the most after four </v>

933
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.910
<v Speaker 2>successive failures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

934
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.830
<v Speaker 2>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homer Simpson said to bark,</v>

935
00:50:04.831 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 2>he said to Bart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

936
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you tried and you failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you tried and you failed again.</v>

937
00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:11.970
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

938
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 2>and homer says to Bart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion is never try.</v>

939
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you fail a few times,</v>

940
00:50:20.911 --> 00:50:24.060
<v Speaker 2>that's at attaining something of </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance because you see that you have</v>

941
00:50:24.061 --> 00:50:29.061
<v Speaker 2>no discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the logical response to that is to </v>

942
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>cease positing goals.</v>

943
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>

944
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

945
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:39.551
<v Speaker 3>but we have through technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to have a perfect escape and that </v>

946
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:44.651
<v Speaker 3>escape is into video games where you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>identify with the hero and you can lose </v>

947
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:47.390
<v Speaker 3>the game as often as you wish to with </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody noticing.</v>

948
00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 3>And then as you begin to get better with</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

949
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain manipulations,</v>

950
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 3>you can play that game with certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of people and increase your,</v>

951
00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 3>your skillset at the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're never able to translate that </v>

952
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 3>into everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

953
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

954
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 3>and so you start becoming addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that game,</v>

955
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.850
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:51:09.851 --> 00:51:14.851
<v Speaker 3>which are designed to increase your </v>
<v Speaker 3>dopamine without having to actually </v>

957
00:51:14.851 --> 00:51:14.950
<v Speaker 3>achieve anything.</v>

958
00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the games that's,</v>

959
00:51:16.661 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 2>that's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the video games,</v>

960
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 2>what's different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

961
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:24.310
<v Speaker 2>for a little kid has to be immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewarding.</v>

962
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:27.610
<v Speaker 2>That's why rough and tumble play works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

963
00:51:27.611 --> 00:51:31.630
<v Speaker 2>has to be immediately rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the game shades into real life.</v>

964
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:35.650
<v Speaker 2>But as the game shades into real life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is the rewards are deferred</v>

965
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and you get more and more disciplined at</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being immediately rewarded.</v>

966
00:51:39.761 --> 00:51:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're learning to read or </v>
<v Speaker 2>play the piano for the longterm goal.</v>

967
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:48.420
<v Speaker 2>The thing about video games is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do require the development of skill but </v>

968
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:53.930
<v Speaker 2>be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the immediate reward is built in </v>

969
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.731
<v Speaker 2>along with the delayed reward because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise the game wouldn't be fun for </v>

970
00:51:56.731 --> 00:52:00.811
<v Speaker 2>someone who's learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the problem is is that a lot of </v>

971
00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:04.021
<v Speaker 2>real life games aren't necessarily fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're learning them because you </v>

972
00:52:04.021 --> 00:52:06.460
<v Speaker 2>have to attain a certain level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery and that requires discipline.</v>

973
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.640
<v Speaker 2>That's also what's wrong with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that children can just learn in keeping </v>

974
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.390
<v Speaker 2>with what they're spontaneously </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>

975
00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:18.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's some truth in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because why not file follow a child's </v>

976
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:18.880
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>

977
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:23.881
<v Speaker 2>is that many highly skilled endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually any endeavor that it's going </v>

978
00:52:24.311 --> 00:52:29.311
<v Speaker 2>to be of economic or productive utility </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires a apprenticeship where there's </v>

979
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:35.340
<v Speaker 2>a lot of grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of just disciplinary </v>

980
00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.370
<v Speaker 2>disciplined repetition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

981
00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:38.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well alright,</v>

982
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:38.740
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

983
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.570
<v Speaker 3>and then one more dimension of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as the boy gets to boy,</v>

984
00:52:43.571 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 3>girl age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's,</v>

985
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.990
<v Speaker 3>if he begins to sense that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual,</v>

986
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 3>he noticed is that the girls are far </v>
<v Speaker 3>more interested in going out with the </v>

987
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.621
<v Speaker 3>quarterbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the student body presidents or the </v>

988
00:52:55.621 --> 00:52:57.850
<v Speaker 3>performer type boys that are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>honored in the school system and in life</v>

989
00:52:57.851 --> 00:53:02.851
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he begins to start withdrawing </v>

990
00:53:02.851 --> 00:53:03.040
<v Speaker 3>and fearing that he can attract those </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

991
00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:06.130
<v Speaker 3>especially the ones he's most </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically addicted to.</v>

992
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful ones that cheerleaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he starts withdrawing into porn and porn</v>

993
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:16.660
<v Speaker 3>is not a huge issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the porn basically,</v>

994
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.820
<v Speaker 3>his stimulus is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

995
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.340
<v Speaker 3>the dopamine increasing with each new </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulus.</v>

996
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 3>And so as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it gets addicted to that dopamine,</v>

997
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.960
<v Speaker 3>he begins to get addicted to only being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to be stimulated when the risk </v>

998
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 3>taking is higher and higher.</v>

999
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 3>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he succeeds in one girl,</v>

1000
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 3>woman being able to come over to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and be sexual with her,</v>

1001
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:46.070
<v Speaker 3>but he's so unable to be turned on just </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the mere maybe light touch of a hand,</v>

1002
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or turned on by just being fascinated by</v>

1003
00:53:49.591 --> 00:53:54.591
<v Speaker 3>what she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the interaction or some combination </v>

1004
00:53:54.591 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 3>of the drama of being with her combined </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little bit of touch is so used to</v>

1005
00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 3>a huge amount of stimulus that occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he gets to be trusting of her a</v>

1006
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:03.000
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

1007
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you be this way?</v>

1008
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Can you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you act this way?</v>

1009
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:11.420
<v Speaker 3>And she feels like just some piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>object that is being traded in for the </v>

1010
00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 3>poor and eventually gets disgusted with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1011
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:14.720
<v Speaker 3>withdraws and he begins to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1012
00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this convinces me I him as worthless as </v>

1013
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.611
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only thing that will give me </v>

1014
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:22.611
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction is back to the porn.</v>

1015
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:26.990
<v Speaker 3>And what became a little bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction becomes more of an addiction </v>

1016
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.470
<v Speaker 3>even as he's also becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously frequently addicted to </v>

1017
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 3>video games at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so all of this is that slippery </v>

1018
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.881
<v Speaker 3>slope from the the rough housing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the father is not able to articulate to </v>

1019
00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:43.671
<v Speaker 3>the mother about the value of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>combined with the trust that you were </v>

1020
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:46.310
<v Speaker 3>integrating with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That combined with the lack of post,</v>

1021
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:51.380
<v Speaker 3>the bond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a combined with the postpone </v>

1022
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.531
<v Speaker 3>gratification being taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when the Postgrad postpone </v>

1023
00:54:54.531 --> 00:54:57.830
<v Speaker 3>gratification is not taught the slippery</v>
<v Speaker 3>slope down the hill to shame,</v>

1024
00:54:57.831 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 3>self disgust and fear that if that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he tries anything,</v>

1025
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:07.450
<v Speaker 3>he's just going to prove to himself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to everybody around him that he's one </v>

1026
00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.310
<v Speaker 3>more failure and the degree to which he </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulates that desire to try something</v>

1027
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:15.290
<v Speaker 3>is the announcement publicly to a group </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that he's pretty much going to</v>

1028
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:20.890
<v Speaker 3>say today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try this and tomorrow it's </v>

1029
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.610
<v Speaker 3>gonna be a failure until he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until he becomes enormously shamed.</v>

1030
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:26.930
<v Speaker 3>In worst case scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can lead to such depression that it</v>

1031
00:55:26.931 --> 00:55:31.931
<v Speaker 3>creates a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a desire to commit suicide and in the </v>

1032
00:55:31.931 --> 00:55:32.720
<v Speaker 3>very worst case scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a belief.</v>

1033
00:55:32.721 --> 00:55:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I believe we've seen the school shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that bruise resentment.</v>

1035
00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bruise resentment and anger like </v>

1036
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:42.090
<v Speaker 2>nothing else</v>

1037
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:46.000
<v Speaker 3>and and who they have resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anger about who were the people that </v>

1038
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 3>have rejected him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were the classmates?</v>

1039
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.900
<v Speaker 3>It's the teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody appreciates that sweet </v>

1040
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity inside of him and sees him </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1041
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I am so angry at that and one day I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>want a.</v>

1042
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I have a desperate need to get their </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention and say I count.</v>

1043
00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pay attention to me.</v>

1044
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the worst case scenarios,</v>

1045
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 3>only a very small percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in worst case scenarios,</v>

1046
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:12.420
<v Speaker 3>you can understand the school shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting,</v>

1047
00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 3>emerging from that.</v>

1048
00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for every,</v>

1049
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.520
<v Speaker 2>for every kid who goes and shoots up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1050
00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:20.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a thousand who were fantasizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a direction that's headed that way,</v>

1051
00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not.</v>

1052
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And some of that's at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1053
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:29.401
<v Speaker 2>it's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm very angry at people because </v>

1054
00:56:29.401 --> 00:56:32.071
<v Speaker 2>they don't see the value in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they get to the point where </v>

1055
00:56:32.071 --> 00:56:34.921
<v Speaker 2>they're doing something like fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme violence there are so far past </v>

1056
00:56:34.921 --> 00:56:36.880
<v Speaker 2>that even they think they've developed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hatred for everything.</v>

1057
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1058
00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wish to see it obliterated.</v>

1059
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1060
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1061
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously that's the most terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible outcomes that might be </v>

1062
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:46.520
<v Speaker 2>generated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1063
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:51.391
<v Speaker 2>So you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about rough and tumble play </v>

1064
00:56:51.391 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 2>and delay of gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tied empathy into that.</v>

1065
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:58.390
<v Speaker 2>What are their other cardinal things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're seeing fathers do?</v>

1066
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Because that's pretty early on in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1067
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:05.521
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking at the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with kids there between say a year old </v>

1068
00:57:05.521 --> 00:57:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years old,</v>

1069
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1070
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

1071
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:15.090
<v Speaker 2>what else do you see happening with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers both out the early stages and </v>

1072
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:15.090
<v Speaker 2>then also later on?</v>

1073
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another important thing is,</v>

1074
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:22.130
<v Speaker 3>is the concept of hangout time now for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a mom listening to this who has a </v>

1075
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.670
<v Speaker 3>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1076
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:27.770
<v Speaker 3>we now know that children who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughters who have a significant amount </v>

1077
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 3>of hangout time with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1078
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:33.920
<v Speaker 3>with your dad's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that creates more psychological </v>

1079
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.870
<v Speaker 3>centerdness than any other single </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon with,</v>

1080
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:36.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with boys.</v>

1081
00:57:36.711 --> 00:57:38.750
<v Speaker 3>It's also very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1082
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:44.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're in a divorce situation </v>

1083
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:45.950
<v Speaker 3>and a father has the child for a short </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time,</v>

1084
00:57:45.951 --> 00:57:50.951
<v Speaker 3>let's say on a Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he picks his child up from a soccer </v>

1085
00:57:50.951 --> 00:57:54.410
<v Speaker 3>game and says to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say Josh,</v>

1086
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did the game go?</v>

1087
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:59.150
<v Speaker 3>The and the kid is more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if more likely to say,</v>

1088
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:01.580
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was okay,</v>

1089
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.480
<v Speaker 3>well tell me more josh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just okay dad.</v>

1090
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he can.</v>

1091
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:12.810
<v Speaker 3>So if at that time the dad has to drop </v>
<v Speaker 3>the boys off to the moms because it's </v>

1092
00:58:13.491 --> 00:58:17.870
<v Speaker 3>the end of visitation time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that happens beyond that</v>

1093
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:20.210
<v Speaker 2>is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.960
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in particular,</v>

1095
00:58:21.961 --> 00:58:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I think although it also happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>couples is that,</v>

1096
00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you do to the </v>

1097
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:31.920
<v Speaker 2>person that you're with to task if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

1098
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.520
<v Speaker 2>is to be somewhat withholding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that might be relevant to </v>

1099
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.230
<v Speaker 2>see to what degree you will be pursued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1100
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you asked me whether I've done </v>

1101
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.470
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it went,</v>

1102
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:47.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I'm going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know is do you really care?</v>

1103
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.970
<v Speaker 2>And if you're my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really gonna want to know that?</v>

1104
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:55.200
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the ways I can I can gauge</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is by asking you,</v>

1105
00:58:55.201 --> 00:59:00.201
<v Speaker 2>but that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that assumes that your answer is going </v>

1106
00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:04.341
<v Speaker 2>to be reflective of your actual being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no reason to assume that a </v>

1107
00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:09.141
<v Speaker 2>better way of doing it is for me to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit withholding and a little bit </v>

1108
00:59:09.141 --> 00:59:10.830
<v Speaker 2>resistant because then I can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
00:59:10.831 --> 00:59:13.290
<v Speaker 2>are you going to poke me a bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a fun thing to do.</v>

1110
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:15.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're Kinda Tz you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look kid,</v>

1111
00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poke him in the chest a few times.</v>

1112
00:59:18.091 --> 00:59:20.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like loosen up and talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1113
00:59:20.761 --> 00:59:23.570
<v Speaker 2>And usually if you do that with a kid or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even an adolescent,</v>

1114
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they'll laugh and kind of push your hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and go dad.</v>

1115
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 2>But they're happy to have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>additional product,</v>

1116
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To bring them out of their shell.</v>

1117
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's a demonstration that the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually cares.</v>

1118
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.690
<v Speaker 2>And you do need time for that.</v>

1119
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:42.600
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see the kid,</v>

1120
00:59:42.601 --> 00:59:46.890
<v Speaker 3>if he's done well or she's doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very happy to say,</v>

1121
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I scored three goals today.</v>

1122
00:59:48.991 --> 00:59:51.450
<v Speaker 3>That's more than it's ever been scored </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the history of our school.</v>

1123
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Is that incredible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1124
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 3>They'll share that right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reason for the hesitation on </v>

1125
01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.130
<v Speaker 3>saying something that they're ashamed </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1126
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 3>like I remember one father was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the boy came home and he had been </v>

1127
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.130
<v Speaker 3>the goalie the week before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the following week he was not chosen</v>

1128
01:00:11.131 --> 01:00:12.960
<v Speaker 3>to be goalie and he couldn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>

1129
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 3>And so he hesitates to say something for</v>
<v Speaker 3>his dad because he doesn't want the data</v>

1130
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.500
<v Speaker 3>to sort of either lecturing him or </v>
<v Speaker 3>disapprove of him or be disappointed in </v>

1131
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:23.920
<v Speaker 3>him and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or be,</v>

1132
01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1133
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.430
<v Speaker 3>sort of like feel like that's not my </v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

1134
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want my son to have scored the goals.</v>

1135
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so with all those fears,</v>

1136
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 3>the child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the boy when it comes to </v>

1137
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.021
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will keep any failure to perform </v>

1138
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:39.021
<v Speaker 3>effectively to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now if,</v>

1139
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:43.440
<v Speaker 3>if the dad drops the child off at mom's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that never gets sorted through.</v>

1140
01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:46.320
<v Speaker 3>If the dad has hanging out time with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1141
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 3>let's say they're doing homework </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and dad maybe is watching the </v>

1142
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.771
<v Speaker 3>TV and the kid is doing homework and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they appear about the same time </v>

1143
01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:58.851
<v Speaker 3>getting something from the refrigerator </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a little discussion about </v>

1144
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:02.121
<v Speaker 3>what he wants for dinner and they and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the data asks him to help make dinner </v>

1145
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:03.840
<v Speaker 3>with them rather than just sit and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>take no responsibility,</v>

1146
01:01:03.841 --> 01:01:08.841
<v Speaker 3>which does tend to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked the children to be helpful </v>

1147
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:12.111
<v Speaker 3>with the dinner making and preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just serve them and so in that </v>

1148
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:15.660
<v Speaker 3>process of the child chopping up stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing that type of boring the thing,</v>

1149
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:17.490
<v Speaker 3>the child will tend to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
01:01:17.491 --> 01:01:18.540
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1151
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I was goalie last week but I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>going this week.</v>

1152
01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:26.181
<v Speaker 3>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the data will and what the FA and </v>

1153
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:27.960
<v Speaker 3>the child might say that to the mom even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more quickly,</v>

1154
01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:32.961
<v Speaker 3>but the child's expectations with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mom is the mom will give the child </v>

1155
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:34.540
<v Speaker 3>assurance the end and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweetie,</v>

1156
01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:36.720
<v Speaker 3>it's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fine.</v>

1157
01:01:36.721 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 3>You're wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a very good goal.</v>

1158
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the coach wanted to give the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1159
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.110
<v Speaker 3>the other kids a chance because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>so good,</v>

1160
01:01:43.111 --> 01:01:43.860
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1161
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Whereas expect from data bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>confrontational questioning.</v>

1162
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1163
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I've noticed in </v>

1164
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.801
<v Speaker 2>talking to my clinical clients about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their intimate relationships is I've </v>

1165
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:58.380
<v Speaker 2>been trying to gauge rules of thumb for </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal necessary interaction,</v>

1166
01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:02.370
<v Speaker 2>time to maintain a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with couples I've observed that they</v>

1167
01:02:02.371 --> 01:02:07.371
<v Speaker 2>need like one or two sessions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate time together a week at </v>

1168
01:02:07.471 --> 01:02:12.471
<v Speaker 2>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that or things start to </v>

1169
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:12.510
<v Speaker 2>go south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also need,</v>

1170
01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>as far as I've been able to tell about </v>
<v Speaker 2>90 minutes of communication time across </v>

1171
01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:22.731
<v Speaker 2>a single week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep each other updated in </v>

1172
01:02:22.731 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>relationship to their stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1173
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>

1174
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:30.831
<v Speaker 2>do you have some sense of how you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize hangout time and how much </v>

1175
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:36.531
<v Speaker 2>of it there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it there needs to be in </v>

1176
01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:36.531
<v Speaker 2>order to not go below,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1177
01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:41.481
<v Speaker 2>a dangerous minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing I'd like to </v>

1178
01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 2>pick up on is you had talked a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit about,</v>

1179
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more confrontational approach that a</v>

1180
01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:51.851
<v Speaker 2>father might take when discussing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure or an inadequacy or something </v>

1181
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 2>like that on the part of the child.</v>

1182
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.540
<v Speaker 2>And so I wanted to relate something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned about talking to majority </v>

1183
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:02.280
<v Speaker 2>male audiences in the last year and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half,</v>

1184
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.130
<v Speaker 2>two years about responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and all of that.</v>

1185
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.790
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think that calling someone on </v>

1186
01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 2>their failure is harsh and judgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1187
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:17.330
<v Speaker 2>and it is in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not harsh and judgmental about </v>

1188
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:18.770
<v Speaker 2>their potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1189
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>So if your kid comes to you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
01:03:20.641 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I screwed up and here's what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it did go so well,</v>

1191
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay,</v>

1192
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:29.541
<v Speaker 2>you're a wonderful kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the kid stuck in a bind because </v>

1193
01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:31.470
<v Speaker 2>they're not feeling so wonderful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they failed.</v>

1194
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.820
<v Speaker 2>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1195
01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1196
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>that was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1197
01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what you could do.</v>

1198
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're better than that man.</v>

1199
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Get it together a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's come up with some strategies so </v>

1200
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 2>that you can figure out how that's never</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen to you again,</v>

1201
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 2>and so instead of putting your faith in </v>
<v Speaker 2>who the child is right now,</v>

1202
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:55.010
<v Speaker 2>which I would say in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart is the hallmark of impulsive </v>

1203
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:59.211
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your faith in who the child </v>

1204
01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.220
<v Speaker 2>could be and that's encouragement and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say in,</v>

1205
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:05.250
<v Speaker 2>in circumstances of failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially where the child is motivated </v>

1206
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:05.820
<v Speaker 2>to try again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouragement,</v>

1207
01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 2>beats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it beats impulsive,</v>

1208
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:14.931
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands down as a mark of faith and who </v>

1209
01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:14.931
<v Speaker 2>the child might be.</v>

1210
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it takes a while for the child to </v>

1211
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>both reveal its vulnerability and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a faith that the,</v>

1212
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 3>that the parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1213
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:30.220
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the child tends to open up like a </v>

1214
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.691
<v Speaker 3>flower to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the degrader she went when she or he </v>

1215
01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:38.971
<v Speaker 3>realizes that the security that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>father is creating by being with them </v>

1216
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:41.800
<v Speaker 3>and talking the problem through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there now an ideal setting,</v>

1217
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:44.770
<v Speaker 3>a father who's wise or a mother who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>

1218
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I will not give a solution right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we'll ask the kid.</v>

1219
01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1220
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:55.050
<v Speaker 3>so what did you observe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your best guess as to what </v>

1221
01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:57.130
<v Speaker 3>happened last week versus this week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think was the judges?</v>

1222
01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 3>It was the coaches best intent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1223
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:05.430
<v Speaker 3>and let the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And oftentimes inside of the child is a </v>

1224
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.440
<v Speaker 3>willingness or is a sense of probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>what really did happen.</v>

1225
01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>But a fear of acknowledging it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself or herself and especially </v>

1226
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:16.600
<v Speaker 3>acknowledging it to anyone else because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who they might acknowledge it</v>

1227
01:05:16.601 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>to will not have respect for them.</v>

1228
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.880
<v Speaker 3>And so being able to sort of have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hangout time facilitates enough time to </v>

1229
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:29.791
<v Speaker 3>feel both that large basket of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>large arms of security and nurturing </v>

1230
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 3>surrounding him or her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1231
01:05:33.611 --> 01:05:35.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the father is not going to</v>

1232
01:05:35.441 --> 01:05:36.990
<v Speaker 3>give up on time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1233
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:38.060
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1234
01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 3>we'll be here for me and I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when the father or the mother </v>

1235
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:47.791
<v Speaker 3>facilitates the exploration inside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself about what the problem might be.</v>

1236
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the help in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a Carl Rogers,</v>

1237
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogerian type of sense,</v>

1238
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1239
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:54.390
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1240
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.100
<v Speaker 3>to find out the part of him that already</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows the answer.</v>

1241
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Then the child is experiencing both </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect and a willingness to be </v>

1242
01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.770
<v Speaker 3>confronted by a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I don't have the answer inside of me,</v>

1243
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.270
<v Speaker 3>my father will tell me the truth about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I might be a need to do next.</v>

1244
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:15.510
<v Speaker 3>And he'll have an that telling me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth about what he needs to do next is </v>

1245
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>his way of respecting me without even </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying.</v>

1246
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:22.831
<v Speaker 3>He's respecting may because he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be confronting me with the truth if he </v>

1247
01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:22.831
<v Speaker 3>didn't respect me.</v>

1248
01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more specifically,</v>

1249
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:29.820
<v Speaker 2>not even more specifically than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he didn't respect my intrinsic </v>

1250
01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.020
<v Speaker 2>ability to overcome obstacles and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow,</v>

1251
01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the best,</v>

1252
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 2>the best answer to someone who says I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a problem,</v>

1253
01:06:36.461 --> 01:06:37.240
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1254
01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I have faith that you can overcome that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1255
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Not that you don't have a problem or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're okay the way you are.</v>

1256
01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1257
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem man.</v>

1258
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:46.750
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

1259
01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:51.751
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about that's very much in </v>

1260
01:06:51.751 --> 01:06:52.480
<v Speaker 2>keeping with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say standard,</v>

1261
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:55.390
<v Speaker 2>but relatively deep clinical wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

1262
01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:00.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are much more likely to follow a </v>

1263
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.470
<v Speaker 2>set of injunctions if they generate them</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1264
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>And so we've had some really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences with the program we </v>

1265
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>designed,</v>

1266
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:12.841
<v Speaker 2>called the future authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it helps people come up with a life </v>

1267
01:07:12.841 --> 01:07:12.841
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>

1268
01:07:12.841 --> 01:07:17.440
<v Speaker 2>So they have to craft a vision for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations across the six or seven basic</v>

1269
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:22.441
<v Speaker 2>dimensions of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like intimate relationships and family </v>

1270
01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 2>and career ambitions and education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance to temptation,</v>

1271
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.980
<v Speaker 2>drugs and alcohol care of mental and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical health.</v>

1272
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fundamental dimensions,</v>

1273
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:34.260
<v Speaker 2>use of productive use of time outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work to ask themselves what they would </v>

1274
01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 2>want if they could have what they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to need along those domains,</v>

1275
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>three to five years down the road to </v>
<v Speaker 2>craft a vision based on that,</v>

1276
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:46.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that array of wants and desires,</v>

1277
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.580
<v Speaker 2>and also to write a counter vision which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1278
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>where could you be if you allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to fail,</v>

1279
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:52.450
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1280
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>what might that look like in three to </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years and then to produce a plan.</v>

1281
01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's had remarkable effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particular now young men are doing worse</v>

1282
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:03.550
<v Speaker 2>than young women in academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>

1283
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.330
<v Speaker 2>So the program doesn't seem to have as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much effect for young women,</v>

1284
01:08:07.331 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 2>but that might be because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already doing better,</v>

1285
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.220
<v Speaker 2>but it has a walloping effect on young </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

1286
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:17.490
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Vo in vocational junior college </v>

1287
01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:20.591
<v Speaker 2>settings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our latest piece of data which was </v>

1288
01:08:20.591 --> 01:08:22.901
<v Speaker 2>generated was published last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed that we could reduce dropout </v>

1289
01:08:22.901 --> 01:08:27.101
<v Speaker 2>among young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially aimless ones who hadn't done </v>

1290
01:08:27.101 --> 01:08:29.591
<v Speaker 2>very well in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could drop their dropout rate 50 </v>

1291
01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:32.591
<v Speaker 2>percent and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I've observed </v>

1292
01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:36.701
<v Speaker 2>about young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this might be because they're more </v>

1293
01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:36.701
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable and confrontational than </v>
<v Speaker 2>young women,</v>

1294
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 2>is that unless they have formulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own plan,</v>

1295
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:44.390
<v Speaker 2>they're unlikely to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're talking,</v>

1296
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I think this is true with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1297
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>with young women as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk to them and say,</v>

1298
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what,</v>

1299
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how you're going to get out of it?</v>

1300
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Which is an excellent question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it says to the child,</v>

1301
01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.400
<v Speaker 2>you can think about what happened and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate and you can think of a way out </v>

1302
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the encouragement,</v>

1303
01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you want is to,</v>

1304
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to protect your shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your child.</v>

1305
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You want to encourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that collaborative problem </v>

1306
01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 2>solving is a great way to do that.</v>

1307
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1308
01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.280
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen this over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 3>and certainly the data that I gathered </v>

1309
01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.320
<v Speaker 3>for the boy crisis very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1310
01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that as well.</v>

1311
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 3>And you said the hangout time is part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what helps to do that,</v>

1312
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.870
<v Speaker 3>but also the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1313
01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:30.330
<v Speaker 3>the checks and balances of parenting is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so pivotal for mothers and fathers to </v>

1314
01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:33.620
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right along the lines of what you're</v>

1315
01:09:33.621 --> 01:09:36.020
<v Speaker 3>talking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is um,</v>

1316
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.850
<v Speaker 3>so mother and father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1317
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:42.050
<v Speaker 3>have the child come home from school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say m and S.</v>

1318
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.600
<v Speaker 3>and the child says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Meyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hates me.</v>

1320
01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 3>She hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1321
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be okay in school.</v>

1322
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.640
<v Speaker 3>And maybe the child's in second or third</v>
<v Speaker 3>grade and a mother is sort of reaction </v>

1323
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 3>will tend to be more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

1324
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.980
<v Speaker 3>oh sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me hear more.</v>

1325
01:09:57.981 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 3>And then when child complains more about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much Mrs Meyers hates the child,</v>

1326
01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 3>the mom will tend to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution like,</v>

1327
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:10.990
<v Speaker 3>let me talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait till next week on Monday I'll talk </v>

1328
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:14.171
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make an appointment with the </v>

1329
01:10:14.171 --> 01:10:15.581
<v Speaker 3>principal and we'll talk about seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you can get into a different </v>

1330
01:10:15.581 --> 01:10:16.610
<v Speaker 3>class than Mrs Meyers a dad will.</v>

1331
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Dad's will tend to say to a greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>

1332
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweetie,</v>

1333
01:10:20.361 --> 01:10:25.361
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn to get along with </v>

1334
01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:25.361
<v Speaker 3>people who can't get along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1335
01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is making Mrs Meyers </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about you and the child may or may</v>

1336
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 3>not be revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the child will say,</v>

1337
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1338
01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want me to talk to Mrs Meyers </v>

1339
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 3>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1340
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1341
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1342
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:37.781
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1343
01:10:37.781 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 3>well if I talked with Mrs Meyers about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1344
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think Mrs Meyers would say,</v>

1345
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.720
<v Speaker 3>and then the child under the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly the dad talking or the mom </v>

1346
01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.130
<v Speaker 3>talking with Mrs Meyers will begin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say what a little bit of what Mrs Meyers</v>

1347
01:10:49.131 --> 01:10:50.970
<v Speaker 3>fields and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1348
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.590
<v Speaker 3>and then negotiate a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1349
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.660
<v Speaker 3>an opportunity to talk to Mrs Meyers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then bring this as Myers and the child </v>

1350
01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 3>together have a discussion together.</v>

1351
01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:04.750
<v Speaker 3>And so to see whether the child did Mrs </v>
<v Speaker 3>Meyers can work out and understanding </v>

1352
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 3>where the child begins to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1353
01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 3>it is not the Mrs Meyers inherently and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hates,</v>

1354
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.870
<v Speaker 3>hates Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is that there's something else going </v>

1355
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:16.991
<v Speaker 3>on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the result of working all that </v>

1356
01:11:16.991 --> 01:11:16.991
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1357
01:11:16.991 --> 01:11:21.060
<v Speaker 3>is a way of facilitating the child to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discover,</v>

1358
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost solutions to a problem </v>

1359
01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.731
<v Speaker 3>talking rather than getting a solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than being enabled by the,</v>

1360
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.040
<v Speaker 3>by the system to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the parent who will eventually </v>

1361
01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.491
<v Speaker 3>disappear from the child's life or worse</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet not disappeared from the child's </v>

1362
01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:38.020
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1363
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.740
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so these,</v>

1364
01:11:41.741 --> 01:11:42.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

1365
01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>but oftentimes the mom says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1366
01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:48.830
<v Speaker 3>the child is having a problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1367
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.970
<v Speaker 3>why are you being so insensitive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you blaming,</v>

1368
01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>

1369
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.660
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for creating this problem.</v>

1370
01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1371
01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:59.950
<v Speaker 3>he's telling you that not only does this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Myers hate him,</v>

1372
01:11:59.951 --> 01:12:04.951
<v Speaker 3>but he also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had other kids hate Mrs Meyers as </v>

1373
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's not Jimmy's fault that I </v>

1374
01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:10.240
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the mom will feel dad as being </v>

1375
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.781
<v Speaker 3>insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What in fact dad is being differently </v>

1376
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:12.781
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1377
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1378
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:16.770
<v Speaker 3>and sort of longterm postpone </v>
<v Speaker 3>gratification sensitive.</v>

1379
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1380
01:12:17.551 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not that's a lot colder,</v>

1381
01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 2>a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:26.271
<v Speaker 2>because it also sounds very much like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's grounded in these psychobiological,</v>

1383
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:30.390
<v Speaker 2>at least partially cycle biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between men and women.</v>

1384
01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:35.391
<v Speaker 2>So women are higher in negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more empathic and that's that </v>

1385
01:12:35.391 --> 01:12:39.531
<v Speaker 2>short term empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's perfectly in keeping with </v>

1386
01:12:39.531 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>the approach that you just described and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advantage.</v>

1387
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a particularly advantageous </v>

1388
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>approach to very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very young children,</v>

1389
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 2>especially infants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to be wired properly,</v>

1390
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>to take care of infants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant is always right.</v>

1391
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until about nine months of age or </v>

1392
01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe a year of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right response to your infant,</v>

1393
01:12:57.230 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>if that person is crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's something you should do about</v>

1394
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:06.441
<v Speaker 2>it as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked a fair bit about what </v>

1395
01:13:06.441 --> 01:13:10.311
<v Speaker 2>fathers can do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help their children learn to delay </v>

1396
01:13:10.311 --> 01:13:15.291
<v Speaker 2>gratification and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've talked a little bit about what </v>

1397
01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:15.330
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what mothers can understand about how to</v>

1398
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:18.120
<v Speaker 2>facilitate that and how to trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1399
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could talk a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what families might do in order to </v>

1400
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 2>improve the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve the performance of their boys.</v>

1401
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:31.521
<v Speaker 2>And their girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked a little bit in your book </v>

1402
01:13:31.521 --> 01:13:31.521
<v Speaker 2>about a family dinner nights and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance.</v>

1403
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most important.</v>

1404
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:40.590
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already know that family dinner </v>

1405
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:41.690
<v Speaker 3>nights are important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what makes family dinner nights even</v>

1406
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:45.560
<v Speaker 3>more valuable is when they don't become </v>
<v Speaker 3>family dinner,</v>

1407
01:13:45.561 --> 01:13:49.160
<v Speaker 3>nightmares and knowing how to structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>them so that they don't become family.</v>

1408
01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Dinner Nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1409
01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:53.330
<v Speaker 3>when somebody comes up to me after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>presentation and says,</v>

1410
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 3>know I can't get my children to give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>electronics at dinner.</v>

1411
01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I already know the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1412
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That is that the children are in charge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the parents.</v>

1413
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>

1414
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.490
<v Speaker 3>what can I do to encourage my children </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get involved with,</v>

1415
01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1416
01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.520
<v Speaker 3>to leave the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1417
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the behind.</v>

1418
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1419
01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:17.290
<v Speaker 3>number one answer is to require them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get what is not an option to sit down at</v>

1420
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:22.291
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe some nights you'll want it to </v>

1421
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:22.291
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some nights not.</v>

1422
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 3>But if you're having a family dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

1423
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 3>especially structured family dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

1424
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 3>the number one rule is no electronics at</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>

1425
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:33.620
<v Speaker 3>If that rule is violated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the electronics are taken away for </v>

1426
01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.081
<v Speaker 3>a reasonable period of time and to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>it away right away for a reasonable </v>

1427
01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:37.960
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once the rule is understood,</v>

1428
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could imagine that instigating </v>

1429
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 2>wars in various households.</v>

1430
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1431
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:44.330
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1432
01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.340
<v Speaker 3>and then you begin to structure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>family dinner nights so that everyone </v>

1433
01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:54.191
<v Speaker 3>has an opportunity to talk and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>has at the beginning I'm a structured </v>

1434
01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.940
<v Speaker 3>amount of time that they can check in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say how their week went or how that</v>

1435
01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:03.941
<v Speaker 3>week was going since the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone knows that it's not 40 </v>

1436
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:06.140
<v Speaker 3>minutes for so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one minute for me,</v>

1437
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.910
<v Speaker 3>the interest in family dinner night be </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero for the one that's one minute.</v>

1438
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an extension of the idea of a </v>

1439
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:16.770
<v Speaker 2>fair game too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a refereed fair game.</v>

1440
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a family,</v>

1441
01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:24.360
<v Speaker 3>our job is to make sure everyone's needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>are being handled,</v>

1442
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 3>thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cared about,</v>

1443
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.540
<v Speaker 3>which is the way empathy is created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Empathy is not created by a parent who's</v>

1444
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 3>always empathetic with files,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs or desires.</v>

1445
01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 3>When a parent is always empathetic with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each child's needs and desires,</v>

1446
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 3>the child becomes narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not apathetic,</v>

1447
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.140
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have made a mistake with.</v>

1448
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 2>You could say that three or four times </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a row I think,</v>

1449
01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:48.600
<v Speaker 2>and that would be really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1450
01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Because that's so crucially important </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know if,</v>

1451
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:57.470
<v Speaker 2>if what you're learning is to put other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's feelings at the same level of </v>

1452
01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:02.301
<v Speaker 2>importance as your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then obviously that's associated very </v>

1453
01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:06.261
<v Speaker 2>tightly with delay of gratification with</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to listen with turn taking </v>

1454
01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:09.420
<v Speaker 2>with fair play with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a refereed interaction,</v>

1455
01:16:09.421 --> 01:16:11.750
<v Speaker 2>all of that and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the other.</v>

1456
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.550
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that happens too and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this with couples,</v>

1457
01:16:14.551 --> 01:16:19.551
<v Speaker 2>is that if they have that time together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something analogous to family dinner </v>

1458
01:16:19.551 --> 01:16:20.820
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I think the family dinner ideas</v>

1459
01:16:20.821 --> 01:16:25.821
<v Speaker 2>are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One for reasons I'll mention here in a </v>

1460
01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:27.651
<v Speaker 2>moment is that what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine your family has a story and the </v>

1461
01:16:28.261 --> 01:16:33.261
<v Speaker 2>story is where we came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are and where we're going </v>

1462
01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:36.321
<v Speaker 2>together as a unit and then so and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>each of the individuals within that </v>

1463
01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:40.620
<v Speaker 2>story has a story and then what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing in those family dinners.</v>

1464
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.800
<v Speaker 2>That interaction time is you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual threads of the individual</v>

1465
01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:50.801
<v Speaker 2>story threads and you're weaving them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to make the collective story </v>

1466
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:55.070
<v Speaker 2>and that keeps everyone up to date and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the same page and and able to unable </v>

1467
01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:59.150
<v Speaker 2>to empathize and also a deep manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if I don't know where you are,</v>

1468
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.160
<v Speaker 2>what you're up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure out what you're thinking </v>

1469
01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.621
<v Speaker 2>or feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have to know what story you're </v>

1470
01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:07.500
<v Speaker 2>acting out right now and so to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in order for you to know that.</v>

1471
01:17:07.501 --> 01:17:12.501
<v Speaker 2>For me to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to tell your story </v>

1472
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:12.501
<v Speaker 2>and I have to be able to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about it.</v>

1473
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>And then I think the other thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really important about the shared meal </v>

1474
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1475
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:21.460
<v Speaker 2>human beings are really weird creatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we seriously share food and </v>

1476
01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>we're social eaters.</v>

1477
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 2>People don't eat well if they eat on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>

1478
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And so it's deeply rooted into us that </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of sharing food.</v>

1479
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:33.461
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the extended process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialization is to get everybody to sit</v>

1480
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:38.801
<v Speaker 2>down around food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be polite and thankful for the fact </v>

1481
01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 2>of the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy that,</v>

1482
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:44.650
<v Speaker 2>but then also too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to give and take well that's </v>

1483
01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:44.650
<v Speaker 2>being shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1484
01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I would say if the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of socialization is something </v>

1485
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.840
<v Speaker 2>like the embodiment of rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1486
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.200
<v Speaker 2>the next layer on top of that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to sit down and share food </v>

1487
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and have a civilized and have civilized </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>

1488
01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:03.750
<v Speaker 3>So literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that civilized discourse really </v>

1489
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:04.450
<v Speaker 3>needs to have the respect for story is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1490
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.730
<v Speaker 3>so pivotal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I teach,</v>

1491
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.490
<v Speaker 3>as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of communication courses around</v>

1492
01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 3>the country and one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the dimensions of the single most</v>

1493
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:15.840
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1494
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:21.430
<v Speaker 3>thing that kills marriages are almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>all relationships are biologically </v>

1495
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:25.870
<v Speaker 3>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inability to handle personal criticism </v>

1496
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.940
<v Speaker 3>without becoming defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1497
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:30.941
<v Speaker 3>so my first job is to teach couples how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get around that biological propensity</v>

1498
01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:33.170
<v Speaker 3>to become defensive when they hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism,</v>

1499
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 3>one of the many steps in that process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is much too long to go into now,</v>

1500
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:41.960
<v Speaker 3>but to give them a picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a picture of a person,</v>

1501
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.690
<v Speaker 3>happens to be Mario Cuomo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the former governor of New York.</v>

1502
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:47.600
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was done by four artists,</v>

1503
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:51.250
<v Speaker 3>have a picture that was taken at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>exact same time,</v>

1504
01:18:51.251 --> 01:18:52.210
<v Speaker 3>same place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1505
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:57.570
<v Speaker 3>And there are four different types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists that paint a picture of him like</v>

1506
01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Andy Warhol and Modigliani and so on.</v>

1507
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And so the end work with every couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1508
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.580
<v Speaker 3>To understand that when you hear your </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner's story,</v>

1509
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:12.030
<v Speaker 3>you will owe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you're all looking at the </v>

1510
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.041
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be a different picture that </v>

1511
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:16.591
<v Speaker 3>is being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is being created by each person at </v>

1512
01:19:16.591 --> 01:19:19.471
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the job of couples is to </v>

1513
01:19:19.471 --> 01:19:22.560
<v Speaker 3>understand how much of a sacrifice each </v>
<v Speaker 3>person would make so that the other </v>

1514
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.241
<v Speaker 3>person would live and yet how we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>often not able to handle personal </v>

1515
01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:30.751
<v Speaker 3>criticism and to sort of reorient </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves before we handle personal </v>

1516
01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:33.520
<v Speaker 3>criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move ourselves into a place of really</v>

1517
01:19:33.521 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 3>being fascinated by our partner story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at a fail,</v>

1518
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.120
<v Speaker 3>but at a family dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1519
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:42.640
<v Speaker 3>that has to happen with every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>member of the family that,</v>

1520
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.160
<v Speaker 3>that when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1521
01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.910
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when person a says let some things,</v>

1522
01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.780
<v Speaker 3>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you talking about in school?</v>

1523
01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.280
<v Speaker 3>And somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1524
01:19:51.281 --> 01:19:54.310
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the me too movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And person a says,</v>

1525
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:55.390
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the me too.</v>

1526
01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Movement is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So person besides the me too.</v>

1527
01:19:58.031 --> 01:20:03.031
<v Speaker 3>Movement is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most progressive thing that's ever </v>

1528
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:03.031
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1529
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.350
<v Speaker 3>and so it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is very important that the person who</v>

1530
01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:10.351
<v Speaker 3>says it's the best thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened is listened to fully by the </v>

1531
01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>person who is a who believes is stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vice versa.</v>

1532
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And that there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is that there is facilitative </v>

1533
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 3>questions that the family trains people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask.</v>

1534
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Now this is</v>

1535
01:20:21.370 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of it is know the story before </v>

1536
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>you offer criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1537
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Rogers had good advice about that a</v>

1538
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you probably already know this,</v>

1539
01:20:32.171 --> 01:20:34.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth reiterating for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't.</v>

1540
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.990
<v Speaker 2>So Roger's rule was when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to someone,</v>

1541
01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:44.160
<v Speaker 2>then first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't assume that either you or they </v>

1542
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.671
<v Speaker 2>know what they're talking about or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say because people </v>

1543
01:20:47.671 --> 01:20:50.941
<v Speaker 2>think people think by talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to give them a chance to </v>

1544
01:20:51.461 --> 01:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>get it all out before you jump on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they might change their own mind</v>

1545
01:20:54.701 --> 01:20:56.050
<v Speaker 2>in the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in mid stream,</v>

1546
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>but so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's important.</v>

1547
01:20:57.821 --> 01:21:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Let them formulate the problem before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you jump in with a criticism.</v>

1548
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.060
<v Speaker 2>But then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this I really love this,</v>

1549
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that once the person has laid </v>

1550
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.930
<v Speaker 2>out their story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to say,</v>

1551
01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:14.170
<v Speaker 2>this is what I heard you say.</v>

1552
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you agree with my formulation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that stops the list.</v>

1553
01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it indicates to the speaker that the </v>

1554
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.870
<v Speaker 2>listener actually listened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if if if there's an error,</v>

1555
01:21:25.871 --> 01:21:28.480
<v Speaker 2>then the speaker can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I meant at all,</v>

1556
01:21:28.481 --> 01:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>and then there can be some </v>
<v Speaker 2>clarification,</v>

1557
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.460
<v Speaker 2>but it also forces the listener to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the speaker into a straw man </v>

1558
01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:39.610
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't only that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to summarize what you said.</v>

1559
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I have to summarize what you said in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that you agree with and you know </v>

1560
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:49.591
<v Speaker 2>that that's also a useful technique if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there happens to be some wide variation </v>

1561
01:21:49.591 --> 01:21:51.970
<v Speaker 2>in verbal ability among the participants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there might be because of age,</v>

1562
01:21:51.971 --> 01:21:53.710
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1563
01:21:53.711 --> 01:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>because it might be that even if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>a somewhat incoherent and stuttering and</v>

1564
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 2>impartial in your formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm an older sibling,</v>

1565
01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:05.980
<v Speaker 2>say I might be able to summarize it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you in a way that's actually helpful</v>

1566
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:08.950
<v Speaker 2>to you from the perspective of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive scaffold.</v>

1567
01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1568
01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.120
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the thing you know,</v>

1569
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 2>we know that human beings organize their</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities at the highest level </v>

1570
01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:22.291
<v Speaker 2>through narrative and that narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only thought it's spoken and so you </v>

1571
01:22:23.921 --> 01:22:28.921
<v Speaker 2>speak your personality into being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of shared environments that </v>

1572
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:32.491
<v Speaker 2>you're describing and without that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is fragmented and incoherent and </v>

1573
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:36.871
<v Speaker 2>so were you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see why those shared </v>

1574
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:40.110
<v Speaker 2>social look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if shared meals weren't so damn </v>

1575
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:43.321
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't evolved the capacity to </v>

1576
01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:43.321
<v Speaker 2>engage in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1577
01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:47.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are central to our social </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and to have that abandoned in a </v>

1578
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:48.730
<v Speaker 2>family is really a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so</v>

1579
01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.410
<v Speaker 3>really is everything you said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1580
01:22:52.411 --> 01:22:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Every part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I so agree with you and we know when you</v>

1581
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:57.480
<v Speaker 3>say did that historic something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes someone will say,</v>

1582
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm repeat what they heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say and then the person you asked </v>

1583
01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 3>to die distort anything and the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1584
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you just sort of this.</v>

1585
01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:07.840
<v Speaker 3>And then the other person will argue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1586
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that.</v>

1587
01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:14.340
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rule of the game is the person who </v>

1588
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.560
<v Speaker 3>is speaking whatever makes them feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard,</v>

1589
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 3>that's when you have a distorted </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and it's your job,</v>

1590
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 3>it's your job to assist is like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>customer's always.</v>

1591
01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1592
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:30.690
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean you have to agree </v>

1593
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:32.591
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means you have to have got the </v>

1594
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:32.591
<v Speaker 2>damn story straight.</v>

1595
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:32.591
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

1596
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:37.580
<v Speaker 3>So that's also important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people really do make the mistake </v>

1597
01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 3>of thinking that if I get correct what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1598
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 3>that they had said that means I agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

1599
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:47.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean it only means you've </v>

1600
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.870
<v Speaker 3>heard them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1601
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what a family dinner tonight is </v>

1602
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:51.400
<v Speaker 3>about is having a chance to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

1603
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.221
<v Speaker 3>if it's a personal criticism or be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to respond to that and have the person </v>

1604
01:23:55.221 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1605
01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:01.160
<v Speaker 3>who is listening to what made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism to begin with here that </v>

1606
01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.581
<v Speaker 3>response and ask if there's any </v>
<v Speaker 3>distortion on what they've heard to </v>

1607
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:04.581
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

1608
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:07.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest challenge for people.</v>

1609
01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was interviewed once by NPR</v>

1610
01:24:10.351 --> 01:24:11.010
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1611
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 3>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1612
01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:15.930
<v Speaker 3>some of the people who are allied with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the men's movement.</v>

1613
01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:16.400
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1614
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.880
<v Speaker 3>they seem like hateful people.</v>

1615
01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:18.810
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1616
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're calling yourself progressive </v>

1617
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.130
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to a as we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I consider myself more on the </v>

1618
01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 3>liberal side of most things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1619
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 3>and then our first job is to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people feel heard,</v>

1620
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.470
<v Speaker 3>they stopped painting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hating is,</v>

1621
01:24:37.471 --> 01:24:41.490
<v Speaker 3>comes from a buildup of not being seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being heard,</v>

1622
01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.410
<v Speaker 3>being distorted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being blamed or caricature in a negative</v>

1623
01:24:46.411 --> 01:24:49.410
<v Speaker 3>way before your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before your heard it.</v>

1624
01:24:49.411 --> 01:24:52.260
<v Speaker 3>So that is the job of every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1625
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:57.290
<v Speaker 3>every person that calls themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive is to start hearing rather </v>

1626
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.170
<v Speaker 3>than arguing first.</v>

1627
01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Well then at least you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to argue about because one of the </v>

1628
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.221
<v Speaker 2>things that happens with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Kristalina communication in the </v>

1629
01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:09.410
<v Speaker 2>family when the stories are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolded,</v>

1630
01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:12.980
<v Speaker 2>as you can identify what the problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and what they're not like.</v>

1631
01:25:12.981 --> 01:25:13.760
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1632
01:25:13.761 --> 01:25:18.761
<v Speaker 2>you might be irritated at having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to your spouse layout in the </v>

1633
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:20.330
<v Speaker 2>stumbling and they're stumbling manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particular problem,</v>

1634
01:25:20.331 --> 01:25:25.331
<v Speaker 2>but if you understand at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they might be dispensing of 98 </v>

1635
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:28.400
<v Speaker 2>problems and only focusing on two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth the wait.</v>

1636
01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:30.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1637
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:32.300
<v Speaker 2>one other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another question for you.</v>

1638
01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who aren't in the </v>

1639
01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:38.150
<v Speaker 2>position where they can have male </v>
<v Speaker 2>involvement with their children,</v>

1640
01:25:38.151 --> 01:25:39.650
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>

1641
01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.900
<v Speaker 2>what do you recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

1642
01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 2>for single mothers who are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best job they can with their kids </v>

1643
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.710
<v Speaker 2>but are having a hard time pulling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>male attention,</v>

1644
01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:52.490
<v Speaker 2>what do you think they can manage for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1645
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:55.610
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge yourself for the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of,</v>

1646
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:55.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1647
01:25:56.590 --> 01:26:01.590
<v Speaker 3>faceted job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're either taking a second as you </v>

1648
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:06.571
<v Speaker 3>look through the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mothers and fathers to ask yourself </v>

1649
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:11.741
<v Speaker 3>whether there's any way you have maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>not valued your former husband in a way </v>

1650
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.060
<v Speaker 3>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1651
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:16.730
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would draw him into the fold.</v>

1652
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.370
<v Speaker 3>But at the answer to those questions are</v>
<v Speaker 3>in no,</v>

1653
01:26:19.371 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I have value at him and I still can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>draw him into the fold.</v>

1654
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Essentially a deadbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that.</v>

1655
01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then here's some options.</v>

1656
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.390
<v Speaker 3>The number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1657
01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 3>the greatest amount of evidence is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>involving your children with cub scouts </v>

1658
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.230
<v Speaker 3>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1659
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:39.800
<v Speaker 3>has a very well developed program for </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing character,</v>

1660
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity,</v>

1661
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.750
<v Speaker 3>loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1662
01:26:43.751 --> 01:26:46.190
<v Speaker 3>a sense of making promises that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep.</v>

1663
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so very good.</v>

1664
01:26:47.991 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Studies have been done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have children involved in cub scouts for</v>

1665
01:26:51.531 --> 01:26:56.531
<v Speaker 3>two years or longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this means not just getting your </v>

1666
01:26:56.531 --> 01:26:57.980
<v Speaker 3>child involved in cub scouts here or </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1667
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1668
01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and if your child doesn't like something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happened,</v>

1669
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:06.580
<v Speaker 3>making sure your child gets back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fold and deals with what,</v>

1670
01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that it shouldn't be your child's </v>

1671
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.630
<v Speaker 3>choice to go to cub scouts or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to cub scouts as part of your </v>

1672
01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:16.340
<v Speaker 3>parental responsibility to get him there</v>
<v Speaker 3>later to boy scouts.</v>

1673
01:27:16.341 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Or it doesn't have to be cub scouts or </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy scouts.</v>

1674
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the y's.</v>

1675
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Some y's have good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good programs also for,</v>

1676
01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:27.560
<v Speaker 3>for young boys of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Project has good programs for young boys</v>

1677
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:31.240
<v Speaker 3>now for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a real good help,</v>

1678
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.380
<v Speaker 3>assistance to help boys with fathering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1679
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.880
<v Speaker 3>the boys clubs have some good programs </v>
<v Speaker 3>with young boys.</v>

1680
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Get Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your child,</v>

1681
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a male mentor try to get your child</v>

1682
01:27:43.671 --> 01:27:48.671
<v Speaker 3>to a school that has a significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of males in at the age that your </v>

1683
01:27:48.671 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 3>child is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if your child is very young.</v>

1684
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:56.710
<v Speaker 3>It's very important that a child not go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a mom only home to female only </v>

1685
01:27:56.991 --> 01:28:01.991
<v Speaker 3>schools because the child will start </v>
<v Speaker 3>searching for an identity from somebody </v>

1686
01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:06.761
<v Speaker 3>that's usually destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a gang leader that will give a </v>

1687
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.090
<v Speaker 3>false identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these are just some of many,</v>

1688
01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:12.040
<v Speaker 3>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you see it,</v>

1689
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 3>we often think that a child needs a male</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentor.</v>

1690
01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a child does need a male mentor.</v>

1691
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Try to vet the mentors carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1692
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you get your child to have faith if </v>

1693
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>you're at all involved in faith based </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>

1694
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And even if you don't believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God or not,</v>

1695
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:32.570
<v Speaker 3>not get your child involved in a faith </v>
<v Speaker 3>based community,</v>

1696
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a good male counselor,</v>

1697
01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has groups for children,</v>

1698
01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.560
<v Speaker 3>for young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes young people that are having </v>

1699
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:44.560
<v Speaker 3>troubles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1700
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:44.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1701
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.390
<v Speaker 3>the ability to be encouraged to express </v>
<v Speaker 3>your feelings to other males and see </v>

1702
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:54.731
<v Speaker 3>that your son is not just having the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not isolated in the problems he's </v>

1703
01:28:54.731 --> 01:28:54.731
<v Speaker 3>facing.</v>

1704
01:28:54.731 --> 01:28:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1705
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 3>but there's many other boys his age that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are having the same problems.</v>

1706
01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Getting him to be able to express his </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings about that,</v>

1707
01:29:02.071 --> 01:29:05.030
<v Speaker 3>his fears about that to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a,</v>

1708
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.630
<v Speaker 3>have a little experience has done where </v>
<v Speaker 3>he paints a mask for themselves and what</v>

1709
01:29:09.631 --> 01:29:10.990
<v Speaker 3>the mask says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what,</v>

1710
01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 3>what is really being said underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mask.</v>

1711
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:18.380
<v Speaker 3>A good fiscal male facilitator can be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful encourager of a boy to express</v>

1712
01:29:18.991 --> 01:29:23.180
<v Speaker 3>his feelings rather than repress his </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings in a society that is as well.</v>

1713
01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:28.410
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we all have a need to do is to get </v>

1714
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:32.211
<v Speaker 3>out there and say something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaging has happened in our society in </v>

1715
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:37.311
<v Speaker 3>the last 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had what I started this work with </v>

1716
01:29:37.311 --> 01:29:41.961
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the commission to create a White </v>

1717
01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 3>House council on boys and men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started that after a call from the </v>

1718
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:47.310
<v Speaker 3>White House to say asking if I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an advisor to the White House Council</v>

1719
01:29:47.311 --> 01:29:52.311
<v Speaker 3>on women and girls because of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>background with the National </v>

1720
01:29:52.311 --> 01:29:52.311
<v Speaker 3>Organization for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1721
01:29:52.311 --> 01:29:53.850
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there also needs to be a White House</v>

1722
01:29:53.851 --> 01:29:55.560
<v Speaker 3>council on boys and men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1723
01:29:55.561 --> 01:30:00.561
<v Speaker 3>for eight years we work to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and now we're working with the </v>

1724
01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 3>trump administration to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1725
01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:05.930
<v Speaker 3>And no one is getting on board yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the importance of making that happen</v>

1726
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:11.750
<v Speaker 3>is that there has to be entire change in</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude and atmosphere,</v>

1727
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:17.300
<v Speaker 3>that we are not just living in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal world dominated by a </v>

1728
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:21.801
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the world was dominated by a need </v>

1729
01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:21.801
<v Speaker 3>to survive.</v>

1730
01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:21.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1731
01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1732
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a mother's both sacrificed so </v>

1733
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 3>much of their lives in the hope that </v>
<v Speaker 3>their children would have better lives.</v>

1734
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Women made sacrifices of careers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meant dads or dads made sacrifices in </v>

1735
01:30:35.911 --> 01:30:40.911
<v Speaker 3>their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are very few dads have multiple </v>

1736
01:30:40.911 --> 01:30:44.241
<v Speaker 3>children that that followed the glint in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their eye because you usually fulfilled </v>

1737
01:30:44.241 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 3>occupations that make you fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1738
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:51.981
<v Speaker 3>are not occupations that pay well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of our fathers gave up </v>

1739
01:30:51.981 --> 01:30:53.640
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment in order to do the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>they needed to do,</v>

1740
01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:59.360
<v Speaker 3>like be a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fire fighter or a coal miner or being </v>

1741
01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.691
<v Speaker 3>willing to be disposable in war in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to make their generation </v>

1742
01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 3>safer and have more options and to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sacrifices that our fathers made</v>

1743
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:12.170
<v Speaker 3>called male privilege or male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>or is such an underserving of men so </v>

1744
01:31:13.141 --> 01:31:15.210
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that entire attitude,</v>

1745
01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.480
<v Speaker 2>it's also an underserving of women to </v>
<v Speaker 2>state that the entire cultural structure</v>

1746
01:31:19.481 --> 01:31:21.640
<v Speaker 2>to date has been patriarchal in origin.</v>

1747
01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:23.660
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1748
01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:26.690
<v Speaker 3>you could argue what the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Patriarchy is,</v>

1749
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:32.020
<v Speaker 3>but just understand that your father and</v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfather and great grandfather all </v>

1750
01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 3>all did the exact same thing as your </v>
<v Speaker 3>great grandmothers and so on.</v>

1751
01:31:37.131 --> 01:31:42.131
<v Speaker 3>Did they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave their lives in the hope that </v>

1752
01:31:42.131 --> 01:31:46.091
<v Speaker 3>they're your life and their children's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives would be better with greater </v>

1753
01:31:46.091 --> 01:31:48.380
<v Speaker 3>amounts of opportunities and most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them sacrificed a great deal.</v>

1754
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:53.390
<v Speaker 3>My father managed the company and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother was very unhappy and aiden had </v>

1755
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.780
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his company in Europe.</v>

1756
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.260
<v Speaker 3>My mother was very unhappy living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe rather than in the United States,</v>

1757
01:31:57.261 --> 01:32:02.261
<v Speaker 3>which was more comfortable for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my father eventually gave up his job </v>

1758
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:06.121
<v Speaker 3>and so fluid brushes from door to door </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a year in order to be able to make </v>

1759
01:32:06.121 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 3>sure we had enough money at least to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a state college.</v>

1760
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>And then my mother had a decent home </v>
<v Speaker 3>over ahead and so that the children.</v>

1761
01:32:12.071 --> 01:32:12.490
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

1762
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:15.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's all associated with a little</v>

1763
01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 2>bit of gratitude for the past.</v>

1764
01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:18.940
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be,</v>

1765
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:23.140
<v Speaker 3>instead of criticizing the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>being patriarchal or as parents as being</v>

1766
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should really be saying,</v>

1767
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

1768
01:32:27.611 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grandma,</v>

1769
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:34.050
<v Speaker 3>thank you for making our mastery of </v>
<v Speaker 3>survival enough so that we didn't have </v>

1770
01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:38.881
<v Speaker 3>to focus so much on survival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let us not misuse our opportunities </v>

1771
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 3>by blaming men for the world that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>created that was destructive.</v>

1772
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that we're living a 50 </v>

1773
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.790
<v Speaker 3>percent longer now than we were 120 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1774
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1775
01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 3>and that serves as a result of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the progress that you have made.</v>

1776
01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so yeah,</v>

1777
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.660
<v Speaker 3>this is why we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1778
01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I worked so hard to create this White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House Council on boys and men and why </v>

1779
01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.801
<v Speaker 3>we've created a patriotic count to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to sort of make a begin to raise </v>

1780
01:33:04.801 --> 01:33:07.520
<v Speaker 3>some money to be able to make this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1781
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Whether it happens by the patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>count or some other way,</v>

1782
01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:15.970
<v Speaker 3>we need to have a total revisiting of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the belief of women.</v>

1783
01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Good men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad women are oppressed men oppressors.</v>

1784
01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And instead of the monologues of Hashtag</v>
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

1785
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:27.960
<v Speaker 3>We need to have dialogues and said human</v>
<v Speaker 3>resource centers becoming a h,</v>

1786
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.470
<v Speaker 3>e,</v>
<v Speaker 3>r rather than hr.</v>

1787
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 3>That is all focused on her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1788
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.360
<v Speaker 3>not him in her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really need to have dialogs at work </v>

1789
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 3>about what's working for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not working for women,</v>

1790
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.510
<v Speaker 3>what's working for men and what's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for men and so we really need to</v>

1791
01:33:40.511 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 3>have a fundamental revisiting of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

1792
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:45.380
<v Speaker 3>female and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all,</v>

1793
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 3>all of our gender roles in the past.</v>

1794
01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:53.190
<v Speaker 2>That's an excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an excellent place to bring our </v>

1795
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:55.150
<v Speaker 2>conversation to a close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1796
01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.360
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd really like to talk to you again </v>

1797
01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 2>about probably about pay gap at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1798
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.600
<v Speaker 2>We really concentrated on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you've been outlining in this </v>

1799
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.651
<v Speaker 2>book and your new book and the boy </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis and I would certainly recommend </v>

1800
01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 2>people who are interested in this sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing to go out and pick it up.</v>

1801
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's full of facts and that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice and it's concentrating on something</v>

1802
01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:23.101
<v Speaker 2>that's of crucial importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think maybe that people are </v>

1803
01:34:23.101 --> 01:34:24.310
<v Speaker 2>starting to recognize as crucial as of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial importance.</v>

1804
01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:29.311
<v Speaker 2>I certainly hope so and so your work has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been very useful to me and I appreciate </v>

1805
01:34:29.741 --> 01:34:32.080
<v Speaker 2>it very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time that you spent today being able</v>

1806
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:36.520
<v Speaker 2>to talk to me and I hope we get a chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk again,</v>

1807
01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I would love to talk about the pay gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really impossible to believe that </v>

1808
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:47.021
<v Speaker 3>there is not a patriarchal world if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that men are in more money than </v>

1809
01:34:47.021 --> 01:34:49.850
<v Speaker 3>women do it for the same work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one has to really start with that</v>

1810
01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:51.980
<v Speaker 3>fundamental understanding that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

1811
01:34:51.981 --> 01:34:53.840
<v Speaker 3>much more complex than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1812
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:59.050
<v Speaker 3>and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different story than pretty much </v>

1813
01:34:59.050 --> 01:34:59.050
<v Speaker 3>anybody perceives.</v>

1814
01:34:59.050 --> 01:34:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1815
01:34:59.050 --> 01:35:00.870
<v Speaker 2>So will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will definitely schedule that in.</v>

1816
01:35:00.871 --> 01:35:02.070
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1817
01:35:02.071 --> 01:35:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you very much.</v>
