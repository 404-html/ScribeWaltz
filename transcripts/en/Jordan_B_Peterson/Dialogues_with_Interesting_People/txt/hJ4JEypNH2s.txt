Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       so today I'm talking to Dr James W pennebaker. He is professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Executive Director of Project Twenty Twenty one aimed at rethinking undergraduate education at that university. His cross disciplinary research is related to linguistics, clinical and cognitive psychology, communications, medicine, and computer science. He and his students have explored natural language use group dynamics and personality in educational and other real world settings. He has demonstrated that physical health and work performance can be improved by simple writing or talking exercises. Dr Pennebaker has received numerous awards and honors has written or edited more than 250 scientific articles as well as nine books, including more recently expressive writing words that heal and the secret life of pronouns. He also happens to be one of my favorite psychologists. Welcome Dr Pennebaker. I'm very much looking forward to talking to you guys to be here. Thank you. Great. So, um, as you may know what, because I think we've talked about this a little bit before.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       I developed some computer online, computerized writing programs with my colleagues, one of which we call future authoring. One's passed, all three ones present, all threatening. There are a suite of writing program said they were heavily influenced in their design by your research. Um, my lab's been interested in narrative for a long time and also in, in clinical work and also in the application of psychology, uh, in the, in the real world setting and the practical setting. And I spent a lot of time developing tests to help employers screen for employees and we got pretty good at that. But while I was doing that, I was constantly bombarded with questions from managers of middle managers usually have medium sized and large corporations telling me that it was all well and good if we could hire better employees, but they wanted to know what they could do with their poorer performing employees, uh, because that was a continual, an intractable problem. And I thought, well, you don't have that much interaction with them and it's not that easy to solve people's problems. So there's probably not a lot you could do, but I kinda got sick of telling people that over and over. And so I scoured the literature. It was at that point, probably about 15 years ago, 10, 15 years ago that I came across your research on expressive writing, so maybe you could start by telling us what you, what you learned and how you went about it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       A little bit of background. I'm a social psychologist by training, so

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I. I don't have any clinical training. I'm a. most of my career has just been stumbling upon one idea after another as opposed to approaching anything with a clear set up where it was going. I had been looking at mind body issues. I've always been interested in how psychological factors influence physical health and mental health and I came across a fighting years ago that just bugged me and that was people who have had a major traumatic experience in their lives that were much more likely to get sick and people who had not. Now that that was an old finding, but as I dug in more deeply, what I discovered was people who had a trauma and kept it secret. We're far more likely to have health problems than people who had the same trauma, but who talked with others about it and it made me wonder what if we brought people in the lab and had them actually write about it, some kind of trauma, ideally one they hadn't talked to other people about would that influence their health and that was really the underlying idea.

Speaker 3:          00:04:00       So the very first study was done in 1983 and we brought in about 50 people. Some of them were asked to write about the most dramatic experience of their lives. The other half were asked to write about superficial topics. I'm simplifying this study some and they wrote for four days, 15 minutes a day, and they also gave us permission to track their student health center records. These were college students and this was at a private college where the student health center was right next to the dorms. Well, what we discovered was that those people who were asked about traumatic experiences ended up going to the student health center at about half the rate as people in our control condition. The ones who had regretted about superficial topics over the next three to six months and this was a really studying, finding it was, you know, what I kind of hoped would occur, but I never, uh, I was so thrilled that it actually worked.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       And then we did another study that was very similar and here again, we had half the people write about traumas have right about superficial topics and they just, they, they wrote about trauma or superficial topics. By a flip of the coin. We decided which are the two topics they'd write about and this time we drew blood before we, uh, assign them to condition again after the last day of writing. And then six weeks later and the blood was essay by a group of people at Ohio state looking at immune function. And again, we found that writing about traumatic experiences associated with enhanced immune function and also reductions in doctor visits. And this now takes us to about 1988. And by then other labs started to see what we were doing. And it's the, the whole technique started to take off. And then over the years, more and more including my own found generally positive effects, not always, but generally they're writing about upsetting experiences had this saluatory affected and influenced both health, physical health and mental health. And then later various labs found to be related to all sorts of things associated with, uh, increased, uh, memory, cognitive functioning and so forth. So, so

Speaker 2:          00:06:24       if I remember correctly as well, when you were doing the earliest studies, you were also influenced by Freud's idea of catharsis. And that was the idea that if, if people had a traumatic or unpleasant experience, if they were encouraged to express the emotions that were associated with that experience, that that would be curative. That was partly Freud's hypothesis,

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       but it was a little bit. It's important to. It is absolutely consistent with, with Freud's initial idea. And what was interesting is because most people listening to this podcast, we'll hear Catharsis and they will think that Catharsis means blowing off steam venting. And that's not actually what Freud actually meant. And it's interesting in Europe, catharsis has a completely different meaning than it does in North America. So in North America we view it as venting Freud and Jung and Europeans, you'd Catharsis as connecting emotions and thoughts and that is actually what I was doing. I really, I had assumed that Freud meant venting and we had found actually that people who just blew off steam, who he just expressed emotions actually didn't show any health improvements. It was only

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       what stick analysis. Right. And that was really fascinating about the research. So maybe you can tell us a bit about that too.

Speaker 3:          00:07:49       Well, I wasn't initially again, uh, I have never. I had never been at a and been interested in psychotherapy in here. All of a sudden I was doing a study that was essentially glorified psychotherapy, which garbage speaking to clinicians. And then the question was why does writing about an upsetting experience bringing about these changes? And it's not a straightforward question, but there's not a straightforward answer. And my lab and others started looking at all sorts of possibilities and looking at markers of inhibition, you know, the people holding back, we're more prone to illness. And what this did was to loosen them up. We didn't find good evidence for that. Other people had other hypotheses and at some point I started looking at what people were actually saying and I got groups of people, students who are in clinical psychology to write the essays that people wrote in on all these different dimensions and what I found was that relying on people to read these essays and come up with some kind of deep understanding or even predicting if a person would benefit or not just didn't work.

Speaker 3:          00:09:04       It was too hard. The stories were really traumatic. They actually depressed a lot of the people who were in our system who, who were reading the essays. So it occurred to me it would make much more sense to come up with some objective marker of reading these essays and a computer program would be what I needed. Well, it turns out back then, this was now the early nineties. There was no such program and fortunately I'd take it a little computer science in college and one of my graduate students, Martha Francis, had actually done some done her undergraduate degree in computer science. And so I asked Martha to essentially help me to a computer program that could go through and analyze the the language of an essay, and the idea behind it is really quite simple. You have the computer go in and look at each word and you would compare each word in the essay with some master list of words.

Speaker 3:          00:10:02       So we would, let's say we're looking for anger words. We want the computer to count up all the words associated with anger. So we'd have this dictionary of anger words. And to get that dictionary we had to make that ourselves. We had to look in dictionaries, thesauruses. We had to have students generate anger words. And then we had all these rules of what account, what makes for an egg award versus not. But once you have that list, you go through and you have the computer look at each word, compare it with a master list, and anytime it finds it anger word, it just adds it up. And at the end it adds up. All the anger words divided by the total number of words, and it produces the percentage of total anger words. In an essay, and we did this now for not just anger words or sad words, guilt words, negative emotion words in general, but we did positive emotion words and then cognitive words, words that suggested cause and effect like cars because effect, rationale where such as that, and then as long as we were doing it, we added more and more dimensions.

Speaker 3:          00:11:03       We, you know, we had pronouns and prepositions and articles, etc. Etc. And wE ended up with about. Now there's probably 80 different dimensions, but when we went back and started looking at essays, we found that certain dimensions of writing really predicted health improvements. Now we found that the use of positive emotions was associated with health improvement. So if you cAn write an essay about the worst thing in your life and still use positive emotions, it's a marker that you're going to show health improvements. The effects are pretty small negative emotion words using a moderate number of negative emotions is weakly related to doing better as well. But what turned out to be far stronger was use of cognitive words. Whereas like, because effect where it's like understand and realize no, these are words that we now know are markers of people working through a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:12:04       Let me ask you a question about that because I saw it a lot about that. I thought that was really aN interesting idea. So, um, this question has to do with the function of memory. So it's, it's pretty obvious that we don't and count store what's the equivalent of a videotape of the entire domain of sensory experience when we're interacting with people. Um, and, and it just so obvious as well that that isn't how memory works and that memory is modifiable across time. And so here's a hypothesis for you and you tell me what you think about this. It seems to me that the purpose of memory is so that you can remember the good things that happened to you in the past and how they occurred and duplicate them in the future and remember the bad things that happened and figure out why and change your course of lights and your pathway in the future so that they occur less frequently.

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       And so the cause and effect analysis would be something like the adjustment of a, of a pathway map and it sort of reminds me of the work that was done with rap memory because the hippa campus seems to store or something like cognitive maps and maps almost by definition are are are representations of ways to get from one place to another and so you could say maybe that you go from one place to another and you fall into a hole and that's very traumatic and so you, you remember the pathway and how you got there and analyze it and reconstruct a different potential future causal pathway so that you don't have to fall into the same hole twice. You know, I don't know what you think about that, but.

Speaker 3:          00:13:44       Well I think that actually I think that works is true both the way you describe it, but also on a much broader metaphorical level. So for example, a person who falls into an emotional hole that their life is going well and then their girlfriend dumps them and they go and get drunk in a bar and wreck their car. That experience is incredibly, incredibly complex and it, unlike the rat, what the human mind has to figure out what in the world went on with my girlfriend, why did she leave me? What did I do? Why did I go get drunk? Have I been drinking too much and right. If to process that requires tremendous cognitive capacity and what happens is if it's something were humiliated about, were really reticent to talk to other people about it and we. So we add languages, a really efficient way to process complex issues. Yes. Shared language, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Well, so what I found in my clinical practice very frequently is that I, I think with, with people who are traumatized, they often encounter. this is something else I wanted to ask you both. They often have an encounter with malevolence as well as a, as a, as an encounter with just catastrophe. So it's not only did something bad happens to them, it's often something bad that's been consciously directed that the by another person and they have a really hard time mapping that, especially if there is somewhat naive people, but then the other people who are mentally affected by such things and can recover are those who have no one to listen to them because people, it seems to me that most people think by talking and unless you have someone to talk to, you actually don't get to think through it and draw the appropriate, let's call them cause the lessons.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       So, and then you also made this comment about, you know, let's say the classic example I like to use is that, you know, maybe you're a premed student and you write the medical, the g, what is it, what's the one for, for medical entrance kept. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you know, you consider yourself as a pretty solid student and that's a core element of. You're like, it's a predicate of the multiple maps of your life that you use. And then you write the end cap and you end up with 20th percentile scores. And so then what happens is that not only is your map of the future now rendered null and void, but so is your map of you as a predicate for president actions and also everything about yourself that you thought held true in the past has to be reexamined and so it's something like the the degree of trauma is proportionate to the amount of the area that have map that's disturbed by the, by the, by the unfortunate, unexpected, and sometimes the malevolent event.

Speaker 2:          00:16:46       ANd so then the other thing I was thinking about with regards to this, and I think this is more germane to the immunological element, is so it's obviously very, very difficult for the mind to compute how dangerous the environment is because the environment in some senses infinitely dangerous. And you never know when something small happens to you. If it's the harbinger of something that's terrible. So because an ache in your side can be the cancer that kills you. So you might ask yourself, given the complexity of, of framing in an unexpected event, how do you ever manage it? And so part of it's temperamental, so if you're higher in neuroticism, things hit you harder and part of it is based on your observed competence. But the other part I think is something like, it's something like the brain computes the proportion of times that you failed in the past compared to the performer to the times that you've succeeded and calculates.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       I liked that name, danger in depths, and then it raises up your average cortisol levels in correspondence to how dangerous the general environment as being because that puts you on alert more. And the problem with the advantage to being on alert is that, well, if anything else negative happens, you're more ready to act. But the negative consequences is the cortisol is toxic and in reason, you know, in high doses across time. And it also suppresses immunological function and it also tends to suppress prefrontal functioning as well because the prefrontal cortex is more involved in low, medium to longterm planning and less in short term emergency preparation activities. So I'd also like to know if you know that, that those ideas ring, ring a bell.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       So they do that. There's an interesting. So the, there's another dimension that ties into this and that is sleep, so we know that sleep is intimately related to cortisol is related to depression, is related to immune function, is related to, you know, all of these systems are inter correlated and the person who is dealing with an upheaval that they're trying to understand what they'd had, don't have somebody to talk to, end up not sleeping as well and part of it is they're trying to process all this additional information and this ties into the idea of working memory that they have less working memory. They're not Sleeping as well. Cortisol is is higher there and they are also worse friends, so when you talk to them, they're distracted. They're not paying attention and so all of these things are working together to undermine the person. Now their cortisol hypothesis is a wonderful hypothesis.

Speaker 3:          00:19:43       The killer problem is that the studies that have been done with cortisol and is linked to writing and trauma have been. you'd have to stand back and look at the overall studies. It kind of squint and there's a weak evidence to support it, but it's not as clean as I wish it were. Of course, this has been the problem with, with the writing and research, but it's also the problem of all clinical research that theory is, you know, once you start getting real data, and this is not just self reports of p of a client said, oh yeah, that was really great. When you start to get a hard data, everything is kind of off the table that the effect sizes are very, very modest. Either way. That's true of medical outcomes as well for medical disease. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:31       So, okay, so you're the downward spiral that you sort of described there too, could also account for, could also account for the negative health consequences post trauma. I mean, so you can imagine, first of all is that the traumatized person is going to be more reactive to two additional trauma, but also that as they, as they, as the effects of their failure cascade, say across their friendship, interfere with their, uh, educational function, interfere with their sleep. The quality of their life overall is going to decline and that should also produce multiple small stressors that are going to compromise something, including say that the decreased sleep and maybe also alterations and appetite and those might accumulate across time and produced the negative health consequences as well. And don't forget the little smoke more. Drink board, take more drugs, stop exercising. Yes. Kids out there. When you have a trauma, uh, take care of yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       You're right, right, right. Yes, yes. Yeah. Well, I mean, the first thing I do with my clinical clients generally speaking, is make sure that they're getting enough sleep and try to reregulate they're sleeping and also to make sure they eat breakfast at least because that, that without those two things, it's very difficult for someone to get themselves back on the straight and narrow. So. So now when we designed the self authoring program, I think I had read, I think it was researched by Laura King, but I don't remember. Somebody had taken your, your writing exercises and applied them to the future. Had people write about the future instead of the past and found similar effects. Was that Laura King? Do you remember? What was interesting was that study you would think having people write what she did

Speaker 3:          00:22:22       I thought was she'd have people write about the past versus right about the future versus both. And her idea was that having them write about both would be best because way therapy sometimes works in that way. so let's just work through your issues and what are the implications for the future. She found That writing about both actually wasn't very effective, that having them write about the future was beneficial or just the pass was beneficial. And since then there've been a lot of other studies looking at having people write about positive effects and, or just negative. And what is generally found is that writing about positive effects is also beneficial for health. But the

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       kind of indicates is the thinking has been official for health. I think that's, that's true. And it's also like,

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       you know, the best studies as I stand back and look at the kind of, the broad,

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:23:20       panorama of cover search is giving people instructions to write really loosely in the sense of here you write about the most traumatic experience of your life, but in a lot of people haven't had traumas or maybe you've come to terms with traumas, but friday about those topics that are waiting upon you the most right now. They may be positive, may be negative if they may be most or a little bit of both. And, and essentially that's what I encourage people to do is to, if you're having trouble sleeping, you know, set aside 15 minutes and just explore your thoughts and feelings about issues that are weighing on you. Maybe something that you don't want to talk about or something you don't really even want to address.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       Yeah. Yeah. Well when we, when we set up the run you by the latest research on the future authoring program because you don't know about all of it. But um, so basically what we've done with the future authoring program, which is the one with which now we've administered to thousands of university students in different locales with very, very stable results. And the results are quite remarkable, I think. Um, so the way the thing is structured is we first get people to consider six important dimensions of their life. So we're, we're kind of construing the individual as something that's distributed across dimensions, practical dimensions. So those are um, intimate relationship friendships, family, career education, um, time spent outside of work and use of drugs and alcohol because that's a rabbit hole. People can really go down and having a, at least an idea of how you should handle intoxicating substances is better than just going into it blindly.

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       So the first thing we get people to write about and loosely following, following that idea, it's like a free association idea and psych gwen analysis, right? It's like, but it also, I think, frees people up to make mistakes because they get uptight if they have to do it right. You have to say, look, you don't have to do it right. You can do it badly. It's better than not doing it at all, so we have them write about to envision what they would like to take it, have what they wanted on each of those domains, so like, okay, it's three to five years down the road. Imagine you're taking care of yourself and and as if you were someone you cared about and that things were set up optimally for you, hypothetically, what would that look like? And what I found in my clinical practice very frequently is that people are afraid of specifying their future because they're afraid of hope, but also there's an avoidance element which is that once you specify your criteria for success, you've also specified your criteria for failure.

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       If you keep things vague and ill defined, then you can stumBle along without ever really noticing that you're lost and it's a really bad strategy in the medium to longterm, but I think it's effective as a means of of well itself. It's effective self deception in the short term anyways. they do that first and then we get them to write for 15 minutes with with no concern for spelling or grammar, which I think we took directly from your and just just sketch out what life could be like three, three years down the road if they had what would be good for them. All right, so now that that also gives them something to aim for it. And so one of, one of the things that we've, we've, we've been thinking through with regards to having something to aim for is the fact that the systems that utilize dopamine, the incentive reward systems, which, which basically produced most of the positive emotion that have the kind that people really liked only respond in relationship to a specified goal.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       So you, you feel an incentive reward kit when you're moving towards a value target. And so if there's no value target, there's no positive emotion in lights except in consequence of direct pleasure's sake. But there's no ongoing excitement or enthusiasm about tackling hard problems, for example, because there's no evidence that those are related to a value destination. And it's the entire dopaminergic system that, that, that, that responds to that. And that's of course the system that cocaine and drugs like that effect. And so then we do something else which we've introduced more recently, which is we say, okay, now look you, you specified the positive pole and that gives you something to to run towards. NoW we want you to think through the ways that the faults that you have and and they and the resentment and anger that you hold for whatever it is that you're angry about and resentful about an unhappy about and to consider your bad habits and imagine where those could drag you three to five years from now if you let them take the upper hand.

Speaker 2:          00:28:26       And so people write about that for 15 minutes and we think, well, that gives them a negative pole to run away from like a hell to run away from under heaven to run towards. And there's some good evidence from the animal literature that animals that are running away and running towards. At the same time, our run faster, they're more motivated. And then in the second half they lay out a, a well articulated longterm implementable plan and we try to get them to deeply articulated, say, well, you know, drake it into eight goals, rank order the goals if you attain goal number one, why would that be good for you? Why would it be good for your family? Why would it be good for broader society? what would you do with obstacles or rose? Okay. So that's the pad. And now at the university of rotterdam at the business school there.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       So it's the rotterdam school of management. I've been working with mckayla, shippers there and her colleagues. We've run about 7,000 people through that now. And they, the research indicates there's a bunch of interesting things. Um, overall it's raised grade point average about 20 percent and drop drop dropout rate about 25 percent, which is absolutely phenomenal. Was larger effects that we would have imagined. But the effects are quite interesting because, you know, most, most interventions you rate if there's a distribution of performance, you, you intervene and you raise the higher performing people even higher, you know, absent a ceiling effect. Performance. This has the opposite of stack, it raises the lower end up and so at. At rotterdam, the students that were most positively affected were the ones who were performing the worst and there are the way we divided them up by gender and and ethnicity, so male, female obviously, but then we divided them into ethnic hollander's, so mostly caucasian natives and then non western ethnic minorities.

Speaker 2:          00:30:34       So the males were underperforming the females and then it was female dutch natives, male dutch natives, female nonwestern, ethnic minorities, male non western ethnic minorities. There was a big gap between the dutch females said that non western ethnic minority men within two years of completing the program, non-ethnic western minority men past the dutch women even though women also increased a little bit. Yeah. So and then we replicated that more recently in Canada at a little college called mohawk college and we found there that men were underperforming women again and then we divided them into how well they were doing in high school before they came into college. And the worst performing males were the ones who were doing poorly in university before they hit college or the sorry, the males who were in high school and who had the worst grades, were those who improved most with the use of the future authoring program and they all, they did the whole thing in an hour badly in one session.

Speaker 3:          00:31:45       That's very impressive. Could you send me a copy of that? I'd, I'd love to see that. No problem.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       Copy the mohawk paper yet because it hasn't been released, but I can send you. I'll send you the rest of them. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       that's be assaults because these are the issues. Of course I'm dealing with right now on here at the university of Texas trying to find out, you know, most of the interventions that we're are looking at is essentially a mean at a lower social class. Kids who are coming to college for the first time, who faced so many obstacles that the upper middle class students aren't even aware exist.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Well we're, we're, we're trying to think through why this works. You know. And so part of it is, I think, and I've thought this through a lot, and part of it is I think that schools before college never require really require kids to make a decision and they don't teach them how to make decisions. They never teach them that their life is theirs to master, let's say, and that they have to make a plan, but that the plant has to serve them. We also have a suspicion that maybe men will work unless they have their own plan. Maybe that's associated with trait agreeableness, although we were still investigating that, but there is no doubt that these, at least as far as our research has shown that these interventions, the future planning interventions seem to have a more salutary effect on men. But the men are under performing, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:33:12       So for some reason the women don't have the same problem, but it's something like males won't work unless they have their own reasons to which, which wouldn't surprise me given that males are more disagreeable than females. So it's certainly possible. But you know, the, the effects on dropout at mohawk college for walloping about 50 percent decrease in the first semester, and we, of course, that's when kids always drop out. So there's something about having a plan. So we are thinking to that, what's happening is, and this kinda goes back to your comments about both positive and negative emotion, it's, it seems to be something like uncertainty reduction and so and so that reduces the effect of doubt, let's say. And also tagging, you know, having the person designed a future, they also want tags success with positive emotion and that carries them forward potentially through obstacles. So

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       yes, it'd be very interesting to analyze the essays that these people wrote using, uh, using our computer program.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       Yeah. Well, you know, I think we may have done that, if I remember correctly, we may have done that with, uh, with the, uh, rotterdam study, but I'd have to look because we've used your l rwc a couple of times to look for the same sort of phenomena. Um, we've also done that to look at whether or not we could extract out big five traits from, for writing samples and that's also possible.

Speaker 3:          00:34:37       So sometimes I'm less sanguine about the big five approach because language and self reports are really, really different animals.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       Yeah. well, I'd like to talk to you now if you would about, um, about your now you, you, you did the computer analysis and words and that got you interested in different categories of words. Correct. And a whole book on pronouns. Part of the reason I want to talk to you about pronouns, apart from the fact that I'm interested in this, I'd been embroiled in a political controversy in Canada for the last five months that they, there's been legislation here formulated at the federal level. It's already in place, provincial level mandating the use of what had been called preferred pronouns. And I don't know if that's come to the university of Texas at austin or not yet, but the idea is that people have, um, a nonspecific gender, let's say, have the right to choose pronouns by which other people will address them. And that's actually been mandated and canadian law, which is something I'd been objecting to sephora asleep because I don't believe the government should mandate language content. I think it's a massive error, but. But anyway, so I have a specific interest in pronouns and I know also the pronouns are in a closed linguistic categories, so they don't change that frequently. But he wrote a whole book describing why pronouns were so significant from a psychological perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:36:06       Right? And it's more, it's not just pronouns, it's a whole class of words called function words. And if you look at any text, are you listening very carefully? Most of what we convey our, what we call content words. These are nouns and regular verbs and adjectives. Most adverts, and they're there, the guts of what we're talking about, but we have all these little words, articles and the prepositions to have for pronouns. He, she, they, it, et cetera. And in english, there's only about 180 common pronouns. Now the average person has vocabuLary of 100,000 words, but only less than one half of one percent of those words are these function words. Yet they account for 60 percent of all the words we use, they are, they control how we talk and what they are specifying is how we connect with one another they are, and how we connect with our topic and how we think about ourselves and our group. And by analyzing these function words, you get a really good sense of who a person is and that that's the underlying theory of the work I've been doing for the last several years using this computer program, which is linguistic inquiries, word count l, iwc, which I pronounced luke. And the loop program is really just a dumb program that it mostly is looking at these function words.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       So. So tell us some things that you've found with specific words. So, so, um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       let's start off with, with the most commonly used spoken word, which is the word I, I tells us so much about people. And if you go into your email, you're going to see that you use it sometimes. Sometimes in an email you will. So for example, people who are depressed use the word I more than when they're not depressed. People who are suicidal, is it even more so, one of our first studies was looking at poet, so either committed suicide or didn't. And we analyze their poetry. The suicidal poets did not use more negative emotion words. They didn't make more references to death. They used the word I more and why? Because pronouns, including telling us where we're paying attention or if you used the word I yourself focused and we, and you know, as a clinician that what are the theories of depression is that it's a disease of self focused at people are so ruminative and looking inwards. So much

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       so. So let me ask you, let me ask you a question about that. So if that seems related to the, to the psychometric finding that self consciousness is a facet of neuroticism.

Speaker 3:          00:38:56       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       let me ask you one other question along with that. but, so because self conscIousness seems to load with the negative emotions, but also one of the things that I often recommend to my clinical clients who are socially anxious because I've watched how they interact and because they get so focused, they don't look at other people. They don't look at theIr face, for example, and that's thinking about how other people are looking at them and they're busy thinking about what to say next, and so what happens is they stopped looking at the face of the people that they're there, they're talking to or listening to them, and so then they're extraordinarily awkward and so what I've done is instead of telling people to stop thinking about themselves, the set, when you enter a conversation really, really focused on the other people push you attention outward because that seems to activate their unconscious and automatize professional, let's say social skills and then you can flow with the conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       That's exactly right, and and to build on this, the idea of people who are leaders and status, if you look at the two people you can, you can tell with remarkable accuracy who's the higher status by the person who uses fewer eyes. The high Status person doesn't use the word I much. The lower status person does it because the high status person is looking out at the world and the lower status person is. Your pointed out is looking inward and you could take this to the bank, go look at your emails and you'll see when you're writing to someone of higher status, you tend to use I'm or, and when you're writing to someone with lower status, you use it less so it's so.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       Okay, so let me. Okay. Let me tell you another observation that I had. You tell me what you think about this. I'm going to tell you what to tell you about a, an observation from animation first. So I've done some very in depth analysis of various disney movies including the lion king and the lion king involves on a child and then an adolescent lion who matures and so and the animators also represented his father. Now his father has a very interesting face because it looks like this, like it's, it's, it's focused forward and kind of staring almost. You were almost predatory because of predatory gaze. Gazes locked on someone else, but. And then the, the adolescent lion who's kind of naive and imbecilic in some sense is like this all the time. And so it seems to me that there's a relationship between immaturity and and self focus and maturity and outward focus and in the lion king, where when, when the adolescent lion undergoes this initiation, right, his face changes into one like this and do one of determination.

Speaker 2:          00:41:55       And the other thing that, that seems related to this is that, you know, when, when people are speaking in front of a group, they often get self conscious and they feel all the eyes on them and that makes them self conscious. And one of the things that I've recommended to people who want to speak to groups is never to speak to the group, just to look at one individual and then another individual and then another individual because that, well that seems to foster communication, but it also blows out the probability of becoming self conscious. So

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       that's exactly. That's exactly right. In fact, I have recommended to teacher trainers. So here's what you do at my university for teacher training. You give a a practice lecture and you have the, the camera is in the audience looking at you. That's the wrong way to do it. The way that you should train teachers is put a camera behind the teacher at the audience and point out afterwards, look, they're not. That guy's not paying attention to you. That person is and the net. In other words, not making yourself focus, making you that. If you're training the teacher training, a public speaker doing exactly what you're saying, you should give them the view of the what the audience looks like and not what you look like. That's the exact wrong training.

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       Absolutely. Okay, so tell me what you think about this. When I'm lecturing, I pay attention to the people who are paying attention. Now, most of the time, most people in my lectures are paying attention, at least a reasonable proportion of them, but the ones that aren't, well, I don't know why they're not here, but there's lots of reasons. They might've had a bad night. They might be overtired, they may have taken the chorus by mistake. I mean god only knows, but if I paid attention to the students that are paying attention, then I can read off their faces. How the audience is thinking, especially if I glance around, but it's that intense communication from individual to individual but seems to make a lecturer or an interview or a conversation really compelling.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       That's exactly right. And I think that's the secret to what are the secrets to being a good teacher and a good speaker is really being able to watch. And when also to the judge, when all of a sudden you're starting to lose, you know, you're, you're also doing little experiments the whole time. Uh, you know, one of the things that people who are relatively new is they start to lose people and then they start speaking more quickly, which of course is precisely the wrong thing to do

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       and they start less attention

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       because they get self conscious and want to hide from the audience. And then they get into a loop and things just go, you know, the, the worst speakers I'd ever seen stand at the front of the, of the audience with your head down and mumble at their feet. It's just painful. I mean. okay. Okay. So that's very interesting. So, okay, so you talked about, you talked about dominance. What else have you learned about specific words? Um, well, a couple more things about. I mixed with some others. One is his honesty, so the ability to detect deception versus honesty as a function of how people talk and what we find is that we've done many studies where we induced people to lie and tell the truth and then we look at the transcripts of the two. When we find iS when people tell the truth, they tend to use it more that they're owning what they're saying and the person who was lying is psychologically distancing, distancing themselves from what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       And then there's another feature is when you're telling the truth, you tend to use more words that are. We used to call them exclusive words or differentiation words where you use words like except, but without exclude word for you making a distinction between west inner category and not in a category that these exclusive kind of words are. You're being more honest because you're saying what you did but also what you didn't do. And that's a really complex cognitive tasks. Whereas if you're lying and you didn't do any of it, just say what you did not do is just beyond the capabilities of most people. So both, uh, I were usage in these exclusive words together do a pretty good job. And, and another one is also focusing on details. So if you do there with political speeches. Oh yeah. And there had been some, there's been some nice research on that as well. Jeff hancock, for example, is not. Stanford has played with this idea quite a bit when he was looking at all of the rhetoric about what weapons of mass destruction during the bush administration that their, that what he found was the administrators were being using deceptive language, uh, prior to, uh, to the u. S were before prior to our going to war. Huh.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       So, so, so that opens up a whole completely appalling, an interesting scenario. It's like me increasingly people are using computer programs to analyze personality and that sort of thing by, by analyzing people's behavior on the web.

Speaker 3:          00:47:17       That's exactly right. And, and we've been done, been doing this a lot with, with, uh, a political figures and if, in fact I'm one of my graduate students and like caitlyn, Jordan, how we've been, we have a website, it's called birdwatchers word watchers.wordpress.com. And like, go in there, you can see our analysis of trump. And actually this whole election from, from, uh, from my perspective as a scientist, this has been a phenomenal electoral season as a human being. Not so much, but

Speaker 2:          00:47:53       I'm going to get you, when we're done here, I'll email you and you could give me some links. Okay. That I can put in a description here where people can go look this sort of thing up. You bet. So that's interesting. So can you, can you actually rank order politicians in terms of the probability that they're telling the truth?

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       I'm not. So we have, yes, I could, but I'm not sure I trust it very much because one of the interesting issues about deception is you've got some people who are deceptive, who are deceptive, but they honestly believe they're telling the truth. And I think, I think trump actually falls into that category. I think he actually believes what he says. Eddie might say just the opposite 10 minutes later and he'll believe that as well.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       Yeah. So do you suppose? No. Okay. So that's interesting because I've seen in, in poorly written undergraduate essays you commonly see, I think about it as fracturing at different levels of the linguistic hierarchy. So you know, if you listen to his schizophrenia speak, they're actually fractured at the level of the frames. And then if you listen to a manic speak, they're more like fractured out the level of the sentence or the paragraph they can say a whole paragraph. And then the next paragraph they'll say something completely different. It contradicts the first paragraph, but there's no awareness of the contradiction and poorly written undergraduate essays. There'll be a claim made on page one and then a claim made john made on page two that are completely antithetical. And you know, it isn't self evident that you become conscious of paradoxes in your thinking unless you act out both propositions simultaneously and it produces a conflict because you can hold paradoxes recommendation without ever knowing it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       And so maybe maybe what happens with someone who who does that sort of contradictory speech is temperamentally, they're very confident. So they might be assertive, for example, something like that and maybe also low end or high end stress tolerance. So they're not anxious. People are, they're assertive and they don't really care so much what other people think. So they come across continually as confident and so that would be more temperamental confidence which is, which is a form. It's a funny thing because it's not exactly the same as telling the truth, but it is something more like believing what you say or believing in what you say.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       That's right. And what I think that the text approach is better at is when a person knows damn well they're telling, telling a lie, and, and that's when our tails do better. There's another phenomenon is called a performative. That's one of my favorite that you can you hear. And that is performatives are used in linguistics and they're usually a phrase and they might be something like, let me assure you, or as I said before, or believed me when I say, and if you have a performative, it makes the entire sentence and you're not able to detect if it's true or not. So you can't establish the truth value. Let me assure you that this is a glass of water. Now, is that true or not? Well, it's. Yes, actually it is because I want, you know, I want to assure you that a glass of water, it's true because I want to assure you that, that it is, even though it's not, what happens is consciously we don't know we do this, but it's almost so our brain is kind of trying to protect us and we throw these up and I have another webpage that has a number of performatives that you see in president after president where the president says something that the beginning sets it up.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       So it's performative and then the second half. Sure enough, isn't it? It is a lie.

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       Yeah. Well, so do you suppose that. Okay, that's interesting. So do you, do you suppose that. So is the performative a marker for, for, for deceit, isn't it,

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       is it, is? I think it is, yeah. So I think it is and it's edited fact. In fact, trump's great. His best word is believe me. So, um, I know more about the army than the generals, believe me. Right, right. Was quite interesting. He is, and it's, it is. It's a form of performative, which is he's really saying please believe me that I know more that the doctor, that he doesn't use it that way, but that's what it essentially is. So it's,

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       it kind of makes you wonder if he thinks that if people believe in that makes it true. Yeah, exactly. It's a funny thing because there is some truth to the idea that

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       true things are what other people believe. No, obviously you don't want to go too far down that road, but there is something, I mean because for example, a contract holds no truth unless there's consensus around it. So whenever the reality is dependent on everyone agreeing to do the same thing, then consensus is actually a very good marker for truth, you know, because there's lots of situations where you say, well if we agree on all this then it's going to be true. That's what a contract is. So, so it's, it's almost as if using words like that, it's an attempt to establish a contract where no contract can genuinely be established. I mean we can have a contract about whether or not Iran has weapons of mass destruction, but we can certainly have a contract about whether or not we'll go to war over it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       With regards to two interesting words.

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       Well there's a, there's a whole. We could go for hours on this actually. So another one that I've been quite interested in is using these groups of words and looking at how to people connect and in terms of these function words. So what we could do is we can actually calculate the percentage agreement we have in our use of pronouns. Prepositions are those articles, conjunctions and so forth. And we call this language style matching. And the closer to people are in their, in their use of these words, in any given conversation, uh, the more they are in tune with each other

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       being on the same wavelength.

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       That's exactly right. And it's not necessarily liking one another, it's been absolutely paying attention to one another. So two people in the midst of an argument tend to entrain really closely, just like two people madly in love. Now we've done analysis of transcripts of a speed dates and what we find is we actually can predict who will go into subsequent date at race somewhat higher than the people themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       So what's happening is the rapid establishment of mutual limitation. That's exactly right, exactly what happens from the australian perspective when two children start to play.

Speaker 3:          00:55:17       That's exactly right. And we've looked at a. One that I particularly liked was we studied, we looked at 86 dating couples. He's a freshman in college and freshman in college are in notoriously unstable relationships, which from my perspective is perfect for research and wait to be in our studies. They had to do instant messaging at least daily with each other. And to give Us 10 days of their igms, which they did and what we did, and we also ask them how good is your relationship? How likely will you be together in several months? And what we found was that we did a shockingly good job at predicting who's still be together. Those people who were just average gut, their their style matching score, their average treatment score, and we just got the top half, 80 percent. We're still together. Three months later, if they were in the bottom half, only 50 percent. We're still together. And self-reports people's self reports about their relationship was absolutely unrelated to whether or not they were still together. That's like dancing videos. I've already started it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       That's exactly right. So, so what that really means in some sense is that it this way is that the two people come together and the two of them, it's as if they're making something, they make something jointly, that they're both acting out so that they're uniting into something central. Then you might think too that in order for that to happen, they have to be paying close attention to each other. And so you can't train with someone unless you pay close attention to them and certainly one of the best markers for the utility of the relationship is going to be whether or not the people pay attention to each other. Right? Finding that's why children are so absolutely desperate for adult attention. That's their currency. That's exactly right. Wow, that's really cool. Well, if you go to another one,

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       because I've got another one, a few, three or four years ago, I started working with much bigger dataset. So this was with, uh, about 25,000 college students who have been admitted to my university over four years and I got their admissions essays and these essays are people's explaining why they want to come to the university, you know, how they have overcome a difficult time or something like that. So each person wrote two essays and a,

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       we went through and started to do some kind of a general analysis of word. You're focusing on these function worms and found that there was a central dimension to language. And this is a fundamental dimension and it's when I'm calling it is analytic versus narrative thinking. People high on analytic thinking are using high rates of articles and prepositions at the other end of this dimension are people who are using high rates of pronouns on zillow, reverbs, conjunctions, negotiations, and so forth. it is a coherent dimension and that any texts is, can be put along this continuum and in fact, it's like a fingerprint. People who, you know, use words at this level tend to do so in other, in other emails, other emails or natural conversation, et cetera. So are the narrative people using metaphors? Yeah, they probably would have.

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       So tell me how you would tell the difference.

Speaker 3:          00:59:01       Well, as I said before, before we get into metaphors, metaphors are going to take us down a rabbit hole. So let's, uh, let's, let's, before we fall down the hole, let me just point out this analytic thinking. What's so cool about it is we were able to track these students grades over the next four years of college. And the higher they were on analytic thinking, the better they did in college. And in terms of grades, it was correlated about point two. And it didn't matter if they were physics majors or fine art majors, if they were in engineering, psychology, uh, music, uh, social work that this, you could take this to the bank. The more analytical person is in their essay, the better they do in college. And part of it is as colleges based on, on analytic thinking. But it's also correlated with intelligence.

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       It's correlated with sat, which, uh, probably about point three, point three five. Oh yeah, that's pretty good. That's it. It's really quite striking. And what's interesting is, is that we can now use this as kind of a remote sensor to get a sense of how smart somebody is. So for analyzing, you're a dangerous man. I'm a dangerous man. Parents. yeah. Yeah. So that's another one that we've been playing with many other things. We've been doing a lot of work on author identification. So we published a cool article, one of my graduate students, Ryan Boyd, and I've been focusing on last, uh, last play or a play that was attributed to shakespeare with people didn't know if it was or not. And we were able to do some really smart analysis showing pretty clearly that it was written by shakespeare, probably coauthored with another guy, John Fletcher, and we, and we looked at some other manuscripts that have been called into question that have come out of the 17th century it. so we know we've been taking this work in all of these different directions.

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       Cool. Okay. So let's close thIs off by. Why don't you tell us something about what you're doing with regards to revamping, um, undergraduate education at the university of Texas and what you and what your aims are and also why it was that you were.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       Exactly. It all gets into my analysis of language. I was doing all of this work trying to understand could I get a say a group of initially to people, but then it's been five people to interact with one another on the computer and if so, can I track how they are interacting with each other and get a sense of how the group was working and working with some computer scientists. We were able to come up with a really slick program to do that. Then it occurred to me, would it be interesting to do that in a large class because I taught a large introductory psychology class with a colleague of mine, sam gosling, and we had 500 students in the class. We had them bring a laptop to class one day and we were able to break the class into small groups of five each.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       They could interact with each other and we were able to track how they were interacting and we get feedback to the group trying to get the group to work better, so we using this style matching and we can tell people whether or not people, the members of the group were paying attention attention to each other or someone was talking too much. We could ask him to not talk so much and so forth, and it worked. The next semester we realized we could use this idea and revamp the class from top to bottom where we got rid of the textbook, so all readings were online. We'd have a quiz at the beginning of every class. We would have break the class into interactions more frequently. Another word started to rethink the class from top to bottom, and then we moved it into an online class so that we, we were able to broadcast out and we switched the format of the class.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       It was like a tv show, so we were behind a desk, we'd have fake news, we'd have at least one of us would be in front of the green screen and some other, the place it used to be able to use to know what I meant. But I know as soon as I said that, I realized I can't use that anymore, but this idea of one of us would be on, on, on, uh, in front of a scene somewhere on earth, you know. So. So, uh, what else? No, I would say, sam, where are you? It looks like you are in a balloon today and so it looks like he's in a balloon and so forth. In any case, the point was we turned this into a television show and it, what we found was that by broadcasting this out to the 1500 students, we sent it up because there was testing every day that students were in class every day they were focusing more on the materials, they were more engaged and it turns out that their average performance went up compared to when we taught it in the past and more impressively, we people who took our, our online class did better in the other classes they were taking that semester class and the classes they took the semester afterwards and uh, it wasn't huge.

Speaker 3:          01:04:24       It was like a difference between a three point one versus a three point two five. And we reduced the disparity between upper middle and lower middle class students in terms of their performance. So that historically we found one letter grade between the upper middle and lower middle class students and now and now we had reduced it to point four letter grade. That's what was happening with the, with the future authoring program. That's right. And that's. And we heard that differential effect on, on the lower performing students. Well, it turns out we came across some previous research that had found similar effects, but it deals with frequent testing. The idea is kids who come from lower middle class backgrounds by and large went to crappy high schools and in these high schools, these were, by the way, our kids are all smart. They're are always. Most of them are the top seven percent of their high school class.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       But if they were at a crappy high school, they learned to get by by memorizing because the tests were memorization test. And so these kids were great at memorizing and then they come to a real university where you're not tested on memorization. You have to think conceptually. Right? And historically when we taught those classes, the classes, we had the usual three or four tests over the course of the semester, I would always get students in my office walking in after the first test saying I have never made a b in my life and I just failed your first test. That's impossible. How is this even possible? And I say, how did you study while I had flashcards? I did this, I memorized this, and I said, I told you memorization. Does it work? You have to think conceptually, and that doesn't mean anything to these kids, but now you've got a test every day and you fail that first test, pow, you fail the second test power and all of a sudden you're realizing, wow, it's treated with memorizing doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          01:06:25       Okay. So you think what's happening is that they're learning that memorization doesn't work faster. That's exactly right. That's really funny.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       And, and they use these skills in their other classes because they realized memorization is not working in the other classes either.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       So how do they catch onto the. Okay, so now they know that memorization doesn't work. How do they figure out what does work? Well,

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       it's been interesting moving to the online world. We create all of these videos, which basically there's a video on how to take, how to study and there's another video on how to take a test and another video on um, you know, have you managed your time? In other words, now we, we understand the problem a lot better than we did before and so students are taking advantage of these resources and ended up doing better.

Speaker 2:          01:07:15       Huh? That's cool. So how long have you been doing now?

Speaker 3:          01:07:19       So after. So we started the class the first year in 2011 and then in the years afterwards I started talking to people at the university of Texas and elsewhere about kennedy, the big picture of education, which was, what the hell are we doing in education right now? You know, the world has changed.

Speaker 2:          01:07:44       I've been asking myself,

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       uh, no, but the world's changed. Why do we have three hour courses? There's no logic for a three hour course. Why do we have a semester that goes from the 1st of January to sometime in may. There's no reason for that. Why don't we have a half hour course? Why don't we have a seminar course? In other words, why do we put things together with the way we do? And it turns out there's really good reasons because in the early 19 hundreds when you need it in a standardized way of talking about credit and so forth, and then we built computers to program this in and we built buildings that we knew how to use time and space and location and and so that your computer will tell you this class is going to meet in this room at this time and your final exam will be at this place and this place.

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       We don't need all of that. Well, that's analogous to the conservation of a physical structure and evolution. That's exactly right. And we don't. And and what's interesting is the university of Texas computer, the read that the registrar uses can't have make a half hour course. It can't, it can't change the semester. It can't do any of these things at a modern student information system. Computer costs an unbelievable amount of money. And so what I'm doing is I am working with the university and the entire infrastructure to start to rethink everything. What should be the curriculum? We don't need all these required courses that we used to have. It makes no sense, but you know, a lot of our requirements made a lot of states 50 years ago and a lot of our classes were flushed out classes. We don't need flunk out clAsses anymore and we can come up with with really brief classes, half our classes to learn a basic skill.

Speaker 3:          01:09:35       For example, we have a requirement. You have to have a statistics course to take upper division psychology classes. Do you really need the statistics score as well? Most of it you don't, and if I asked my people teaching statistics, asking them, do the statistics you're teaching, are they relevant to today? And they all say, oh no, not at all. I mean I don't use analysis of variance. I don't use t tests. I use linear regression. I use this, I use that, but we can't teach that in. My view is if you're going to take my upper division class, you better know correlations and you kinda know correlations up and down. I could teach a correlation. Of course. That would be a point seven our corps and download it and take it anytime. I don't care where you take.

Speaker 2:          01:10:22       Yeah. Well, one of the, I mean I've been using youtube a lot for the last three years, you know, when I put started putting my lectures online just just with an ipad, you know, um, and by, by the beginning of 2016, I've collected about a million views and I thought,

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       oh

Speaker 2:          01:10:44       that's, that's a whole different thing than I thought it was. I thought youtube was for cute cat videos. And then I started thinking it through what I thought, oh no, look, here's the situation map for the first time in human history, the spoken word has as much staying power and reach as books. No more reach you could publish faster and it can be broken up and communicated and all sorts of chunks. It's like, this is absolutely revolutionary. It seems to me that while you're in a race against time,

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       that's exactly right because this is the new world order and it's, you know, it's like every other part of our world right now where we're dealing with the future of ai and the future of, of, of everything that this really messes with the world order because so much of what we can teach can be put up there and it, you know, because the correlations haven't changed a hell of a lot in the last hundred years. You don't need to update your lecture on correlations, right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:50       One really good lecture on correlations, more $10,000. That's also very frightening. That's exactly right. And, but then

Speaker 3:          01:12:01       we do need, you know, we, you know, we're talking now 15th century, we do need a guild mentality. If you're going to become a therapist, a scientist or this or that, you need to have some serious lack of experience. You need to have some serious experience doing things in addition to learning how to think and to get some smart feedback on how to think, how to, how to come up to get up to the level to understand what's involved in trying to make a new size to make new advances. It's an incredibly exciting time and I'm working with all parts of the university. I have 200 people working with me. I've got various, you know, we were dealing with a development studio, working on new ways of thinking of on online and other technologies. I've got a big research methods group trying to find out what even works. We don't even know what works and what doesn't. We're having to deal with extended campus in terms of how we can push out our, our, our classes, our information to the world in a way that has some kind of financial value to the university. So we in this office

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       guys, when you guys been thinking about accreditation, because it seems to me that the business is the big issue. The thing is is the ability to disseminate valuable information was once the university. In some sense how to hammer lock on that. That's gone no more. That's the thing that the. The impediment to mass education at the moment in some sense is the problem of mass accreditation. Universities still have a hammer marketing out, but there's no reason that they need to. So I'm curious, when you're thinking about the mass distribution of education material, what have you been thinking about?

Speaker 3:          01:13:59       The problems and the complexity is this are unbelievable, so some of it is the, the nationwide bureaucracy, so there are accrediting agencies that that don't know how to use deal with fractional credit, don't know how to deal with a variable calendar. We've got financial aid issues because they're based on these old systems as well. We're dealing with intellectual property in terms of who owns the ip of a class, is it the instructors at the university, can university resell it? How do we rethink this? You know, the idea of having free open classes is great, but it's not a very good business model and this has been one of the problems with coursera and edx and you're putting your videos on online for free because the reality is the costume

Speaker 2:          01:14:52       patrion, you know, hey, you know about patriotism? No, it does really interesting. It's a, it's a platform that, that, that, that, that was developed because of the difficulties that creative people were having and monetizing their production. And so with patrion, people can voluntarily buy a monthly subscription if they find that the content that you're producing is worth supporting [inaudible], then they can donate monthly to your patriot on account and they can either do that on a monthly basis or they can pay you a donation per video that you put up. And that's been a very, I thought with my youtube content because I wanted to professionalize what I was doing to some degree to hire a film crew and, and to increase, improve the audio and all of that. And I threw up a. I'm a patriot account online last april when I found out about the technology.

Speaker 2:          01:15:46       just a curiosity and I got about, I don't know, 60 or 70 people subscribing in the first month, so that was kind of interesting and it's enabled me to hire a film crew and that sort of thing. But it's quite interesting because the patriot on people, although there's some perks they get, like I said, the higher donors, a signed copy of, of one of my books for example, but mostly they don't get access to any content that everyone doesn't get access to, but people, people have a strong sense of reciprocity and they're not completely comfortable with the idea of getting something for nothing. And now the patriot on account is being extraordinarily useful. To me. It's, it's, it's

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       very interesting. Yeah, we'll do it now. For example, you know, and these are issues that we're struggling with at the university in terms of how do we do it because to do one of our courses is really quite expensive and you know, talk, you know, 10, 20, $30,000 and trying to figure out the model for it. The one thing that we can do is we can give university credit, so that's, that's, that's one, that's one hold that we have, but it, no, it really does deal with a broader issue and in our society which is, is knowing the and knowing that and knowing how to think sufficient to get by in the real world or do you need the official credential and hopefully we both yes or no. If it was a just world, just knowing the material would be sufficient. It gives you no rapid way of telling the charlatans from.

Speaker 3:          01:17:35       That's, that's the, that's the big issue and that's, that's the big issue is that as the credential becomes more important, the knowledge becomes less important because you can use that credential to, to, to, to play the system. That's right. That's exactly right. So these are the kinds of things that, that I've been dealing with and I, you know, trying to change a giant bureaucracy, turns out it's not real easy and it has all these built in assumptions that, that are part of the structure. Not only not only part of the cognitive apparatus, but actually built right into the infrastructure. That's exactly right, and what I've found is the people at the university had been very supportive. I thought for sure I would run into major obstacles, faculty, students, administrators, even the legislators, because this is a public university are all really supportive and even though I've got support all around, it's still just like swimming through molasses because they're all of these rules and regulations that had been there sometimes for a hundred years that's no longer serve a purpose.

Speaker 3:          01:18:43       You know, that's, you know, maybe you know, maybe you don't know about the typical fortune 500 company over the last 30 years and the typical family fortune three generations. It's for the reasons that you just described is what happens is that the structure itself becomes so anachronistic that not even the people within it can change it. something comes along that's that's younger and it's built on different presuppositions and just takes it out and the probability that that's going to happen to the universities, in my opinion, is overwhelmingly high because of exactly the sorts of things that you described. It's structural. it's built for a different century from the late 18 hundreds. Well it is and actually if you think about it, university started in the 14 hundreds and it's amazing that they have survived as well as they have. That's for sure. That's for sure. Well look, it was really good talking to you. I've enjoyed as much though. I'd been a great admirer of your research and I don't say that lightly because. No, thank you. There's a handful of psychologists that have had a profound effect on me and you're certainly one of them and I would also say you're a spectacular rarity among social psychologists in my estimate. I know that's a nasty thing to say, but being partly a social psychologist, I guess I'm allowed to say it to talk to you again at some

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       point in the future, maybe six months down the road or something because you have all sorts of things that people need to know about and this is a really good way of telling people about them, so I'll email you and get some, if you could think of three or four links and a little description that you'd like to go along with them, put them on, put them in the description of the video. I'll tell you when both the podcast and the video will be up, but that will be very soon. Send me an email and I will. We'll do that. Right. Very nice talking with you. Nice talking with you as well. Thanks so much. Alright, bye. Bye.
