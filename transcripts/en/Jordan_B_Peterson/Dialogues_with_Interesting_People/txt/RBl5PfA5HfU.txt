Speaker 1:          00:16          Short while ago, I had the honor of talking with Ian Hirsi Ali, who I regard as a genuine modern day heroin and a role model for all individuals who desire to speak and embodied the truth. I'll tell you a little bit about her before the discussion starts. Ali Born in 1969 as a Somali Dutch American author and scholar. She's received international attention as a critic of Islam and an advocate for the rights and self determination of Muslim woman opposing honor violence, arranged marriage from which she escaped by immigrating from Somalia and female genital mutilation, to which she was subject as a child. She's a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and Harvard's Kennedy School, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC, and a member of the council on Foreign Relations. She founded the Ion Hirsi Ali Foundation explicitly for the defense of women's rights in 2003 Hirsi. Ali was elected to the lower house of the Dutch House of Representatives, a political crisis related to her Dutch citizenship led to her resignation and indirectly to the fall of the second Balkan end.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Cabinet did not. In 2006, a former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left the faith and became a vocal critic of Islam, particularly in radical forums. She collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled submission. The film depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, sparking controversy and threats of death. Van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by Mohammed booberry, a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorists later that year, Hirsi Ali maintains that quote, Islam is part religion and part a political military doctrine. The part that is a political doctrine contains a worldview, a system of laws, and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life. Her best and influential books include the caged virgin 2004, infidel, 2006 no mad, 2010 and most recently heretic 2015 where she calls for a reef formation of Islam and the defeat of the Islamists in 2005 Hirsi. Ali was named as one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. She's also received a free speech award from the Danish newspaper, Yellen's posting the Swedish Liberal Party's democracy prize and the moral courage award. Her critics accused Ellie of building her career on the denigration of Islam and Muslims questioning her right to authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world, and portraying her as the embodiment of the western colonial civilizing mission discourse.

Speaker 1:          03:09          I guess you'll be able to render judgment on that yourself. After watching our discussion. The first thing I'd like to say is, thank you very much for agreeing to do this video. I'm very happy to be talking to you. I'd be nervous about it all day actually. Oh, well, anything? No, she tells me to do. I see, I see. Okay. Okay. So, well, I sent you some, some questions the other day and I thought that I would first of all ask you, I read your, your recent paper, the one that you wrote for the Hoover Institute called the challenge of Dawa. Yes. And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if you would, to begin with just to tell people if you could give them a brief summary of what you were attempting to accomplish with that. That might be a good way to start.

Speaker 2:          04:01          So what I was trying to accomplish was to get the attention. Oh, I also say, especially if the government, uh, to the ideology that underlie this, the alphabet tentative thing, the misogyny against women, homophobia by Islam is to eliminate all homosexuals, again, increase in antisemitism, the persecuted Christians

Speaker 3:          04:28          guys like me who are ex Muslims and draw attention to the venues where these ideas are disseminated to these schools. It's in the mosque them address that. It's in the neighborhood and it's a photo to use. Sometimes it's these professionals who say that they asked you a large gates for telling young people as young as age how to hate and hate. And once we understand, once we understand these commitments to get into the heads and across people, the ideas with radical Islam that I fit it in, they'll be able to do with the tenor of the outcomes of the call. Radical Islam is an extension of doubt. That's what I'd like to see it as an extension of and for me to have constitutes the violence, the terrorist attacks and the political violence it's used to make that's intended to change. Society will be able to

Speaker 2:          05:42          eliminate, to eliminate eliminated.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Okay, so what exactly would you say is the relationship between Darwin and Jihad? You're formulating it by the sounds of it that Darwin is the to Jihad and these are the concepts reasonably separable and I guess a subsidiary question with that would be we're talking about radical Islam, but of course many of the people who are watching are going to be. It's going to be difficult for them to distinguish between moderate Islam and radical Islam and I'm also curious about your feelings about exactly that distinction and how such a thing might be pursued.

Speaker 2:          06:20          So my approach to it is there is one Islam, but there are three sets of most letters. There's one Islam and that one is land. It's of different components. It has religious components, it has a political component, a social component, but it's all encompassing. Now, if you look at the different sets of Muslims, what you see is one set of Muslims, we just here to the religious prescriptions and they see being a Muslim as something private

Speaker 3:          06:51          and when they're confronted by others about the political activist, other bad things that other Muslims who they involved with the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad who is the founder of Islam by mentioning of his life in the early days when he first started with this religion and sway people and using, but then there's the other set of Muslims I called them. Then the Dean's list, the other ones who they're the ones that engage in Dallas. They're the ones who have the objective of viewing the world. Who is the other ones to hate homosexuals. To date, women who hate Muslims tend to say that it's their duty to die. Converse with people. It's not, I call it the Medina Muslims because they invoke the prophet Muhammad's life and example, and the legacy in Medina. I called the modifiers. These are limbs could sending up to the Medina, Muslims within Islam. As a civilization, as a culture, as a political philosophy, we have a theological problem and we have to deal in theological problem.

Speaker 2:          08:15          So these are for me, these are the three different sets of Muslims,

Speaker 3:          08:19          the problem of the Medina Muslims, the other ones were engaged in your work to differentiate between what's in the dino Muslims to Israel and the attendant. And why don't we first start with Dallas. We've called you to this love and if you reject it, then you are an enemy of his love and use violence in their circular. They're good arguments. Why should we or Islamic law was good for you, for women and Muslims? Uh,

Speaker 2:          08:58          this is what is in the club. This is what Muhammad said, informing anything confused and this, this fall to persuade, to, to buy it. Then they apply for. And that was the reputation of course better, but you have been for the Muslims, but there's to convinced non Muslims from that, for that status. There's this other project, status of purgatory. You know, where you have to pay discriminatory taxes and lead a life of second class citizens. If you look at the Christians who live in Egypt, Christmas, who live in Pakistan, patients who live in the majority of countries, it's that kind of status.

Speaker 1:          09:46          So, so the Mecca Medina distinction seems to be very, I would say both complicated and problematic because. So, so tell me if I'm wrong. Okay. Because my understanding is that Mohammed spent most of the part of his life that was associated with the establishment of Islam in Medina and noting that guy and that it wasn't until he went to Medina, that Islam actually became a force. So back in Mecca, although his doctrine appears to have been, let's say, more peaceful. It was also much less successful as a, as a, both a religious and a political movement. So then he left Mecca and I believe under pressure from the inhabitants, at least to some degree, moved to Medina. And then that's when Islam became more, uh, more, more revolutionary and expansive. And so what do you see now? I know that it isn't universally accepted among the Islamic community that, that Mecca Medina distinction is a reasonable one to make. Because of course, the presumption is that there's an essential unity of thought across the doctrines, but, but given, given your interpretation, and I've read the similar interpretation among other, among other people, do you see, what do you see as hopeful within the Islamic community with regards to bridging the gap between the say the earlier works, so to speak of Mohammed and the later, the later, more, more revolutionary element of the, of his actions and his faith. Is there a way that that can be reconciled?

Speaker 2:          11:20          Do Muslims into Mecca, Mecca, Medina, and modifiers. That's not, of course an official, a distinction not accepted anywhere you really wanted to get to, you know, who, which individuals, which Muslims, uh, at war with us. And should we be worried about what about the vasculature? What about these other Muslims who are speaking up labels? We will give him, if you said the word Islam most work.

Speaker 3:          11:54          One thing that I noticed is that selected and we justified it. I actually, they invoke method. Oh, Mohammed's legacy in Mecca. Because as unfortunately if my sister tells me, Oh yeah, and you've listed there, you need to get up and say I want to invoke some best for my parents, say, oh, come on my relationship with intimate and then make it your business to tell him what to do, and then she would come up with some other ideas or some other, but it's my duty to come in and go, so this limit, but then it's the Medina Muslims extent and I'm not the only one that other scholars like. There are many others who have preserving a position as a culture, as a civilization, and at the same time putting this violence and providing courses within Islam. If you're trying to do that, then you'll go to see your way to make a list of all the concepts that we really don't have any problem with. People being told to pay five times. This is letter of cost in the market and also they just don't have a problem with all of that data that's been referenced to the early days in Medina. As you said, a political philosophy.

Speaker 3:          13:38          Mohammed, we just wars because he would spend and that's exactly where was successful and that Islam is to end and they say, listen,

Speaker 4:          13:55          to be,

Speaker 3:          13:57          you know, it could be emulating. So that's I think where the public market that we apply in the social sciences has its problems, but this simplifies because it focuses, it should work.

Speaker 1:          14:20          Okay. So you see this as an externally applied, um, uh, a category system essentially that that's useful, that's useful for, for, for outsiders who were trying to assess the situation to determine who it is that you're dealing with that might be regarded as an ally and who it is that you're dealing with. It might be regarded as a fold, so to speak, and that would be on the more militant, tend to have things that, that, that, that's a reasonable way of looking at it.

Speaker 3:          14:48          That's reasonable. That's a reasonable way of looking at it. But if you take

Speaker 2:          14:52          the moderates versus extreme classification or categorization, that has become common place. It doesn't tell you what, when we look at model, we think of people who are not using violence. Whereas if you look at Medina, you will see that there are hundreds of thousands of Muslims who do not apply violence now, but who do preach about this and they do preach the Medina legacies and they leave that Sharia should be instituted and in places where they get where you get a majority of these violent and ideally types, then suddenly they apply and forces Sharia alone. So I think the terms model is an extreme are just not good enough. They don't cover.

Speaker 1:          15:38          They also seem to bear any relationship to the internal dynamics of the faith itself. So whatever.

Speaker 2:          15:44          That's also problematic. Okay. So does that because you have to keep going back to the theology. You have to keep going back to the internal debate among Muslims, how to move on and how to relate to the test. So I personally think Mecca and Medina is much more useful as a tool, as an external conceptual framework for understanding the problem we face with Islam. Then extreme versus freshwater and all the, you know, all the other terms that we have. So let me ask you another question about that then. So see, one of the problems that I've had

Speaker 1:          16:20          [inaudible] I've been trying to look at, at the potential for true relationship between Islam and Christianity, you know, to the degree that I understand Islam or Christianity, which of course there's plenty to understand about both, so it's no easy thing to manage, but there is this claim as well that, that that's widespread and rather vague that, that Islam is in essence a religion of peace. And, but when I look at the historical data, say stemming from Medina, the Medina time, and then moving forward and the fact that that Mohammed was definitely someone who engaged personally in warfare and in expansionist warfare, it's not, it's not an easy thing for me to make the leap to, uh, to see comprehending or being able to accept the claim that the fundamental doctrines of Islam are peaceful, are, are, are associated with peace. Because it looks to me like there's an element of it that's quite militaristic.

Speaker 1:          17:14          And I've also thought that let's say there's a religious element to Islam. And I mean this is not an original thought. Obviously there's a religious element to Islam, but there's also something that's clearly more like a political movement and more like a governmental movement and that's also complicated by the fact that there isn't any clear separation between church and state in Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell, so when we hear claims that are, when claims are made that Islam is essentially a religion of peace, then that doesn't seem to be the case with Medina, end of the theological discourse or the actions that that emerged there of and then part of the problem is how do you reconcile that with the contradictions in relationship to the earlier, earlier, as you say, Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to me how that can be done so

Speaker 2:          18:02          as a political force obligated to enforce it. So number one, they did not give have his message. You guys are worshiping false gods, these that you live in a time and I'd like to and come work with. You know what, these peaceful, peaceful. It's because he applied for. Didn't personally. Do you have an attacker describe ourselves in Levina then? He does. That was in the war and the numbers with Muslims and these are people who come from with them by then. Then the says everywhere, wherever that is, destination is only after you accept Islam as long as you refuse to abide by Islamic law or accept to be subdued by Islam, you are at war. That's why they. The Medina is make this distinction between the house of Islam piece and the horrors of war is everywhere where they're introduced and it's the job of the Muslims in the house feed to congrats.

Speaker 1:          19:39          So it's a religion of peace in so far as it's final utopian aim is the cessation of conflict, but it's the cessation of conflict in part as a consequence of of conquests. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well that was more or less how I understood it. So when the claim is made that it's a religion of peace, then that isn't precisely. It's a slight of hand in some sense. With regards specifically to that phrase

Speaker 2:          20:04          that are individuals. That was I skype as maker will say when they say what they really wanted to say, peaceful individual, no problems with other religions and I want to be engaged with any politics or to link politics with religion please.

Speaker 1:          20:23          Right, right, right. And that I wouldn't say it wouldn't be the majority of Muslims worldwide. I'm not sure you agree with that, but it seems to me that it isn't self evidently the case that the majority of human beings are violent and war like and so my sense is is that given the essential peace peacefulness of most people, they're going to take a look at the Islamic doctrine and extract from it those elements that are supportive of that more individual pace, but that still leaves open the question of exactly what the doctrine means as a set of motivational principles and now it seems to be a big part of the current problem and also the need for current discourse. What I would hope is that it would be possible to undertake a dialogue with Islam. Let's say between Islam and the West are between Islam and Judeo Christianity and defined within Islam itself.

Speaker 1:          21:10          The seeds that would enable that dialogue to occur so that some sort of long term negotiated conceptual and practical piece could be attained, but the more I've read about Islam, the more difficult it is for me to understand how that might be managed, especially because of it's because of the war like tradition that emerged from from Medina and then move outward in at a staggering rate from that and also the thing that's quite quite disconcerting to me. I mean it's not like Christianity hasn't been rife with internal divisions like that between the steps and the Catholics, but it also was the case that what you might describe as the civil war that's been occurring within Islam, more or less started as far as I can tell, more or less started that day that Mohammed died and has never stopped since that and that also seems to be. Well obviously it's a problem for the Islamic community itself, but it also seems to be a problem, an increasing problem for the west because we can't not be tangled up in that.

Speaker 2:          22:07          Yeah. We we have to share the planet with one fifth of humanity and it's very clear that things have to change and that's is the beauty of Muslims to change the theological underpinnings of their religion and as far as I'm concerned, this is being pushed by those that I call the farmers or modifies and these are individuals maybe now a little bigger groups are forming views and maybe even being led by some nation state for that. The big question is either going to agree on what to change. So what is in built into Islam is this idea that you. I'm submit edits to the Koran and it's the same thing. You know, Mohammed was a by Muslims as infallible as somebody who never made a mistake. So it's an uphill battle for those Muslims who are seeking modernization to agree on, you know, how to edit, how to persuade Muslims to accept a truly peaceful right. And a truly tolerant idea of religion that separates religion from politics, respects the rights of women or people of other faiths and people within Islam who voted to leave their faith. So how do you get the theological underpinnings for that? Yeah, that's within his lap.

Speaker 1:          23:46          The danger there too is that when that sort of thing is attempted, often reformed from within a religious community, one of the dangers there is that instead of reforming it peacefully, all you do is add another sect to the court.

Speaker 2:          24:00          Yeah. For us secular people, it seems from from a distance it seems kind of easy to say, well why don't they just separate religion from politics and to they just, they can be religious to look at it that way. Simplistic. Because then you get people who want to be religious. These Medina subset, what do you say for Medina was an expression of his muslimness is to convert to Islam to kill me as opposed to if it's to get women to cover up, it's to keep warning us about life life today and all of that.

Speaker 1:          24:36          It. It's the thing that made me, I wouldn't say nervous to some degree from the perspective of someone who analyzes totalitarian ideology because the thing about totalitarian ideology is it tends to be totalitarian, right? It's absolutely all consuming and that's why also when I've been assessing, because I've done a fair bit of research into comparative religion and done my best to expand my knowledge base and I've always had a hard time with Islam in that regard because it's difficult for me to extract out the purely religious elements and to compare them to let's say religious sentiments that have emerged across across humankind and all sorts of different times and arrows and to separate that from the political doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to think more that Islam, you know, broadly and vaguely speaking, is something much more like a political movement than it is in fact like a religious movement.

Speaker 2:          25:30          It is a political theory and it's a political movement. It started out even in Mecca in the early days come to my board, which was a political message. It wasn't a religious message, right? Even in the early days in it was absolute is Islam by its nature is absolutely just because it a complete and total submission of the individual to God and in Medina. Mohammed came around with a political, a blueprint for how society ought to live, the relationship between the individual and the relationship between men and women, husband and wife, the relationship between parent and child, the relationship between the government and the subjects and their duties. It has a court system. It has a military system, so from the very beginning it was more political theory. As we understand the agent today, Jesus Christ founded his religion within an empire. The Roman empire existed before and what he was talking about was all religions. Mohammed, we forget. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:46          yes, right. That's a very important distinction. I mean really, and it might be the crucial distinction, so to speak,

Speaker 2:          26:54          and there was this empire, empire bows and decline and fell and those who feel that they have inherited that legacy. They want to go back to the days of employment for about 20 days when Islam was supremely and they want to do this in the 21st century. All kinds. It's not just. You can't come on horseback and inmate and existing client like the Indian empire that they took over. You could just take things also. It's not like la, but they're driven, they're convinced they have this legacy and they're not afraid of it and is key because, and here's why I keep going back to that life on this temporal and that there is something in the after this. There's no point in investing in this life accepting that nature, so for the Medina Muslims, it really becomes easy to recruit and inspire into their parents' Muslims who have already been taught that they've only got to work for the hereafter problems with Islam and I think it was would understand of course the basic lms of Mohammed Straw with all of the Koran before all of the heat, after all of these things and what Sharia law really means, and then it gets to the past.

Speaker 2:          28:23          This is how they managed to teach young people. How do they manage to teachable or these thousands and millions of people who is subsidizing this countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. Understand that. I think that makes oUr job as western whatever's easiest.

Speaker 1:          28:43          Let's talk about the saudis for a minute. The elephant under the western carpet. I mean, I understand that in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 19 seventies, one of the things that that dictated american foreign policy was the desire to maintain stable oil production and and I can understand that although I think it was short sighted, I can. I can see the logic in that, but it's very difficult for me to see that in any possible way. The saudis can be regarded as true allies of the west and so I don't understand why we have the relationship that we do have with the saudis given. First of all, they were pumping literally trillions of dollars every about every decade into the economy and then given that they practice a particularly pernicious form of, I would say viciously militant islam and second or third, I guess that is that they're pumping out propaganda that pushes this wahhabi viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in the world. I mean, I don't understand, and maybe this is also part of the complexity with regards to western attitudes towards, towards the complex problem of islam. I don't understand why the west doesn't do more to put a stop to that. And so what are your thoughts about that? How does it look to you?

Speaker 2:          29:58          I'm perplexed. I believe that the south would have booked the United States and other western business under this. Someone has to come along and break that. Uh, I, it, I mean, I agree with everything you said within Saudi Arabia, I believe at least three forces, the royal family who I believe now sexier and more modern, they want to go down the larger, incredibly powerful, maybe even more powerful than the oil because the clergy in Saudi Arabia, they have the power to put into people's heads and hearts the wahhabi doctrine. And so it's all about Saudi Arabia here. People who decide what's right or what's wrong, moral other time, right? They have that powerful and then you have the trach, the various stripes who obviously depending on their size of royal family or the clergy or both. There's a dynamic there that is very interesting to watch, but in that sense, Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged as larger established legacy Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 2:          31:27          People medina inside the borders of Saudi Arabia and tyler. Yup, and now I think we the United States and other countries who need to be mad from the saudi royal family because they are the ones who are political, at least the political individuals that we did with tj and say we need a different between the house and the house of will happen because these people are really destroyed. The planet vape. You just said you have to think through what these people have done in south asia, in africa, all over the world. It's the duty of a part of it swells to discredit this lab, this lab that is through institutions and this is. This is therefore policies. we probably could refer that to a soft power. That's where the cloud, but that if you look at what is happening, all these terrorist activities across the people wanting sheree about all of soda really is behind it and I think staying with that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:43          Okay, so let me run a theory by you. It's kind of a twofold theory. So one is that there's a paternalistic attitude in the west towards the saudis that stems from perhaps events that were as far back as 100 years ago, and the paternalistic aspect is to underestimate them as enemies, right? Because you say, well, we could say, well we need the oil and we're going to stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather not have chaos in Saudi Arabia. And so unknown dictator is better than unknown chaos and we saw some proof of that perhaps in what happened with Libya, but so the idea would be there's nothing sufficiently dangerous about the saudis to justify us destabilizing their regime, especially when we're particularly dependent on their oil. And then underneath that would be an underestimation of the danger of ideas. And also, especially when ideas are combined with money. It's something like that. So because the saudis in some sense I think are are fighting what you might regard as a stealth war against the weSt and they're doing it by convincing upcoming generations of the rightness of their particular viewpoint. And so they're in it for the long haul in some sense. And I think we're radically underestimating the danger of that and

Speaker 2:          33:56          it's quite logical law and we're not. Yeah, we're not. I mean you have to think when the soviet union was around, if we hadn't done anything interest was viewed that in economic terms for in military terms and that is not just telling rabia is even Iran, these countries are waging an ideological war and we're not because they believe, well it's religion. Religion is proTected and we don't talk about religion. And that's one thing we believe we're under the spell of these incredibly charming. So that's come to attend our universities that have the emphasis and that reassure us that they're more westernized than we can tell them how they treat their women. So in a way I think, again, I just keep going back and say we are under some sort of spell and at some point someone has to come and break that spell globalization to, you know, a Saudi Arabia opens up to the world economy. We really see what was on Inside their own country and inside all of these other countries. It's the people, the canadian people, western people pushes. And say no to and the amount from their documents that they engage with Saudi Arabia in a different way. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:26          Well, one of the thIngs I really can't figure out, maybe you could shed some light on this too, is that you know, of all the things that women's political movements should be doing in the west is demanding as far as I can tell that the western countries, let's say lead by their male rulers, stop treating the saudis like are there are allies and I cannot understand why there hasn't been a concerted pressure put on western governments by women who are concerned, at least in principle with the equality and freedom of women around the world to stop treating the saudis like they're our allies. And so that, that's another thing that perplexes me entirely in the cynical part of me thinks that the feminists who are more or less hell bent on the destruction of the western patriarchy adopt the attitude that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And so they're willing to put up with what the saudis do. But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation. So I mean you can view our, our culture, so to speak a little bit from, from the outside position because you haven't moved in as an immigrant and that gives you a viewpoint that it's much more difficult for someone within it to share. And so like what do you see as as driving the absence of pressure, let's say from women on governments in relationship to these, I would say reprehensible dictatorships. What's going on?

Speaker 2:          36:43          So the pre occupied with western country after, with what I see is that they have a festival that's focused only. They do not talk about, discuss the issue of a man of color and the patriarchy. Men of color or immigrants of the nations and countries, man, nations and countries outside.

Speaker 3:          37:09          Oh the feminist to the identity politics there was on multiculturalism and all these things are bad for women, western women and bad. So if you believe take multiculturalism is that so and the fasteners one since then they feel that they use to address

Speaker 2:          37:56          greAt belief that black women and muslim women, you know, women of color, if they wanted to get out of oppression, then they should organize themselves. That's what they believe. What I find ironic is that sometimes we do organize ourselves. I am organized another ex muslim woman to talk about the misogyny that's subjected to women in the white, white feminist, atheist. And that's the biggest puzzle

Speaker 1:          38:26          I know. Well, I think that the treatment that you've received at the hands of western feminists, to me that's, that's something that's just absolutely it me absolutely speechless because

Speaker 2:          38:37          not only me, it's all of us. Again, like I could fall to excellence, but there are black women who are fighting for their rights and they all get shut down.

Speaker 1:          38:49          So we were talking about your treatment at the hands, let's say a western feminists and, and like I read infidel, I don't know, very shortly after you published it, which I love that book man. As soon as I read that, I thought, well, I used which hell yeah, you know, I thought it was remarkable. I thought your comment on your comments on viewing western culture from the perspective of an immigrant that was hungry for, for genuine education and, and your comments on your, your experience with the efficiency of the dutch state say, and you're sort of amazement at how well it worked. That was just. I thought that was so remarkable and clearheaded and I thought when I read infidel, I thought, well this woman is immediately going to be a hero to feminists everywhere because she's removed yourself from this oppressive state and moved out into the world and become a powerful figure when.

Speaker 1:          39:41          What was the probability of that? It was like zero, you know, and that you suffered as a consequence of your beliefs and, and you stood up forthrightly for them and I thought if you wanted to find a feminist hero that you are certainly, you're certainly in the running man for exactly that. And then to see how you've been treated. It's just, I just, it just makes my jaw drop, you know? Especially what brandeis did was brandeis right where you were offered an honorary phd and then they revoked it. That just. That was one of the. I think that was almost as reprehensible, inactive cowardice as the west's basic abandonment of solomon rushdie after the fat, what was put on his head and about equally dangerous, so it was multicultural. I mean what I, you know, my message, my lifestyle and who I am, it said they find off the prevalent today. It's against the law

Speaker 2:          40:38          that western values as superior to islamic law and islamic values. Not to say that is to blast being in the temples of multiculturalism today.

Speaker 1:          40:50          I think

Speaker 2:          40:51          I, I hope a lot of people because it wasn't about what they think should happen for victims of misogyny. I think it's all about the disciplines that my wife's and my, my lIfe and my beliefs kind of dissonance. They put these women in. Because if you're going to say, well, it's horrible to be an american woman, and the misogyny in America is worse than that. They say, no, It's not. I'm sort of interfering with their, with their worldview.

Speaker 1:          41:26          The claim that you're making there is something like this and it's really, it's a really vicious claim in a sense, and it's something like the western feminists who are possessed by postmodernism and cultural relativism are willing to sacrifice the freedom and equality of third world women in places like Saudi Arabia to maintain the sanctity of their multicultural notion because that justifies their attack on western patriarchy, so they're willing to use. Okay, so that that's an absolutely

Speaker 2:          41:58          immigration. There are so many men who are coming from these societies as men. They are not used to the equality of women inside the west. First of all, they're all women, child marriages, female genital mutilation, honor killings, but now we have these crepes and sexual harassment of non muslim women and women keep on arguing for more integration and they don't hear anything negative about some of the negative impacts of immigration. I don't consider them feminists anyhow. I think that there are so much more committed to preserving their world view their postmodern as well than they are to the rights of women and they're mean.

Speaker 1:          42:45          I think that that's how it looks to me is like this situation with Saudi Arabia is the one is the test case is like, so you might say, are the postmodern feminists types are the ones who present themselves as. Are they more concerned with the rights of women or are they more concerned with bringing down the so called tyranny of the west and the answer is they're more concerned with the louder than they are with the farmer because when you put them head to head, they dispense with the rights of women across the world as long as they can maintain their moral justification for the radical beliefs and I do think that is why they go after you because you're. You're exacTly the reprehenSible exemplar of what it is that they're attempting to deny. I would say, and I think that does show their true motivations

Speaker 2:          43:30          absolutely. Out at the time. I'm guessing a lot of signals here that I should. I should hang up now, but I really enjoyed talking to you and I hope that in some way I've contributed to, to the message that she wants to get out there.

Speaker 1:          43:44          You know what, I'll start with this, I'll give you 30 seconds. I'll just tell you what, what are doing with this, I mean I have arranged with a group of moderate muslims in Canada and some in the us as well to start a series of dialogues like the one that we had today because this isn't really viciously important problem and so I want to use this as the opener for that. I would like to go after this issue of whether or not a real dialogue could be begun between the judeo Christian West and the islam world with some hope of not having all of this evolved into endless and continual warfare because as far as I can tell, that's where it's headed.

Speaker 2:          44:21          Yes. That's where it's headed. Yeah. Well go get a chance to talk again. Thank you so much. Yep. Bye bye. Bye bye.
