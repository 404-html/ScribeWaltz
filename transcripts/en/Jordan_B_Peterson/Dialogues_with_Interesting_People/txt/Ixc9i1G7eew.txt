Speaker 1:          00:07          We're going to talk about frogs, so yeah. Are you okay? So yeah, when we saw, I mean, when I saw the video that you put up, was it two days ago now? Yeah. Two days ago. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. And the next morning I got an email from my brother who also studies symbolism and it's very, very smart person. And he said, does Jordan know he's incarnating pepe right now.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Yeah. Well that's the funny thing is, you know, I knew about pappy, but what it was, I had nothing like that on my mind when I made the video. It never even entered my mind that that was an association. I mean I was just concentrating on this kermit thing that had popped up that probably popped up about two years ago and I. The first time someone said that I thought, Huh. So I went and listened to Kermit and I thought, Oh yeah, I do have a voice that similar to that I see I can get it lower, but my voice tends to rise up into my right, into my cause of tension. So.

Speaker 1:          01:11          So this is it. We need to do like, so we need to do the metaphysics of PIPPA. No one has done it yet, I think. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:17          exactly. Exactly. Well, and so you know, and then then this strange occurrence. So of course also also emerged with regards to the mask that Charles had made me wear the hat. Yeah. Which it looks like Pippi has red lips, which is staggering. It's absolutely staggering. And so I just about fainted when I, after I posted that and people start, people pointed out the correspondents with pepe. Really? I just about fainted. It was. And that doesn't happen very often. Like I can only remember one other time in my life when I was shocked enough to almost faint. I just thought that was just too much. It was too much to bear. And then thinking about the correspondence is since then it has been. Well it's, it's, it's, it's, it's inexplainable and absurd. But so much of this is inexplicably Missouri. I don't know, I tweeted something yesterday, uh, I looked at maps of meaning my book on the Amazon, a seller lists to see where it was located and it was number eight on, on books that are associated with behaviorism andw , and it was bracketed by two other books, mastery.

Speaker 2:          02:26          Inbound is cheese book, and she's the person who invented the iat that's been used to fair it out. Unconscious bias. Oh my goodness. The other one was a book by Richard Bandler that I think was called frogs and princesses just. And then to find out about cat, you know, I didn't know about CAC. Anyways, it's. And then today I was thinking I was watching Nina Paley who was an absolute genius and she's animated the plagues that, that Moses called down on the Pharaoh. And of course one of the plagues was a plague of frogs. Yeah. And so,

Speaker 1:          02:58          okay. And so the, the, the frog

Speaker 2:          03:00          is, is, is a, is a perfect liminal character because the frog, and I think you tweeted about this as well, the frog lives both in water and on land. And so it's like a, it has a monstrous characteristic that it can cross. It's one of those things that crosses over between, between worlds. Um, and so you see that, you see that in the story. It's the story of the, of the frog and the princess is a perfect example. And he relates to the Pinocchio story that we talked about earlier. Uh, so, uh, princess goes to a pond, she's playing with her favorite thing, which is this golden ball. And so she drops the ball just to mention something. That golden ball is the same thing as the snitch that Harry Potter chases in the quidditch games and Harry Potter. And it's funny because inside the snitch is actually part of Voldemort's soul, right?

Speaker 2:          03:50          So, and so that's part of the soul of evil that's inside the Golden Ball and the golden bowl. And Harry Potter has wings, which makes it around chaos. Technically speaking. It's an alchemical symbol. And the round chaos is a mercurial symbol. And the spirit, mercury is an emissary of the gods. And so the, the guards are speaking to you and when anything flickers in front of you and captures your attention, and in the quidditch game, the person who follows what captures his attention is the seeker and also the person who wins. Not so much the game, but the metagame.

Speaker 1:          04:26          What's important, I think in this story, is that the ball is the most important thing. That's why it's golden. It's golden. So for her it's the idea that it is the most important thing. So she drops this ball in the end, the water it gets, it gets lost. So she loses the most important thing. It falls into chaos,

Speaker 2:          04:42          right? So that's the death of God purposes

Speaker 1:          04:46          or, or just the idea of. Yeah. Or just the idea of, of, of the loss of innocence or you know, whatever. Whatever you think about it in terms of the loss of the most important thing. And so this rog appears and says, you know, I can go get your ball if you, if you, if you promise something for me. And so the promise is that she will bring the frog with her into her castle. Let the frog eat with her and then let the dog sleep in her bed. Okay, so when got those two things, food and sex we talked about before as well, so she saw the frog goes down into the water and then brings up the most important thing and the princesses forced to accept this frog in her. She doesn't want to be like she's very annoyed that she has to to to to to let the frog into her house, eat from a plate and then finally into her bed. But by doing that, the fraud of course transforms into a prince. Here you have this, this, this idea that we talked about before where the most important thing goes out into chaos and whatever can bring it, bring it back, right? Whatever it can bring it back to us has can be tamed and can enter into, into the world. Can you find this place into the world

Speaker 2:          05:59          maybe even turns into this thing of the highest value? Yes, exactly. Well, that's something for people to really think about. About, about marriages for example. So you know, people are always, and I think this is part of the profound immaturity of our culture. People are always running around waiting to find the perfect person who's perfect for them. And so you know, one thing you might think is that if you ever found the perfect person, they would run away from you screaming immediately. So because and so that perfection is something that you have to build within a relationship. And so you accept the other person, so to speak, warts and all and hope that they do the same to you and swear that you won't run from each other. And then as a consequence of that, you can engage in a mutual process of transformation that emerges as a consequence of telling the truth and, and, and having a truthful relationship. And then as a consequence of that, the transformation can take place and you might start with a frog, but maybe you end up with a prince.

Speaker 1:          06:59          So like we talked about the idea that, that this is the structure of the world. And so it happens as much on a personal level as it does on a, on a social level, on a bigger, bigger, bigger sense. So just that little hint we talked about before, the story of Abraham and the three angels coming and announcing the birth of a of Abraham's son. Well, in the story of sleeping beauty, that's exactly what happens. The queen goes to the pond and there, Lo and behold, there's a talking frog and the frog is the one who announced it to the queen that she will have a child, the most beautiful child in the world. And so again, here is this idea of something coming from chaos.

Speaker 2:          07:39          Well that's interesting because you know, in the diagrams in my book, in maps of meaning, one of the diagrams is an egg shape that, that, that is the chaos into which things plunge. But chaos is, it is an absolute state. In some sense. It's, it's the state of the unknown as such. And you never see the unknown as such. You always see something that's partly known and partly unknown. And that's what the frog is sitting on the edge of the pond. The frog enables you. So the, the, the frog is an emissary of chaos, roughly speaking. And you always, you only meet an emissary of chaos. You'd never meet chaos because it's, it's, it's like, uh, it's like, um, it's a non

Speaker 1:          08:18          non non non existent. It's being, it's below being, if you will.

Speaker 2:          08:22          Right? Right. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          08:25          And so, so now this thing like, well, two things, one is interesting is that kermit the frog is, is the same thing because kermit is, is a host, he's a host on a, on a show. And so what he does is he transitions. He's the transition between different worlds. So you have an act and then you have this transitional figure which appears and then you have another act. And so that's what, that's the role that kermit the frog plays on the muppet show. Yes.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Primary problem is ms dot peggy, who's a really loud feminist.

Speaker 1:          08:59          That's hilarious. Okay. And now, now pepe, because well here's, here's, here's the, here's the metaphysics of Pippi. So this is what's happening in the world right now, is that there's a very strange situation where the, the, the people like let's say the right, we'll call them the right or like the forces of order or the, the, the let's say the norm, the people who create the norm for society. Okay. So we're in a situation where things have been inverted and the people who supposedly in the narrative are the ones who create the norm are, are, are being marginalized, they're being pushed into the, into the margins, right? And to be told you're the ones who create the norm and we're going to push you out into, into the margin. And so

Speaker 2:          09:44          that's where they've identified with the frog.

Speaker 1:          09:46          That's why they have identified with the park. Because the, the, what happens is there's a strange inversion that happens, right? The power of inversion and the power of mocking. And the power of, of humor is usually on the side of, of cast. It's usually on this side of the power of the margin.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Well, I noticed like I noticed this happening about 20 years ago is all the, the right wing had all the comedians. I thought, what the Hell's going on here? The right wing doesn't have the comedians. It's the rich. The left. It has the comedians. They're the ones that are poking fun. So strange that the comedians have become the, the right wing has started to express itself in comedy.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Yeah. So that, that, that is a sign that there's a, there's this strange inversion that's happening. Uh, and so there's, there's an interesting, like just a little footnote on this, like in the, in the Bible there's a story that talks about this. It's the story of Elijah. So the time will be Lija. Israel has been worshiping false gods because of the Queen Jezza Bell, right? And Elijah who is supposed to be the prophet of the God of that, of those people has become a marginal figure. And so his name is Elijah the stranger, which is very odd because he's not a, he is supposed to be a prophet of God and his tool, his mockery. He mocks the prophets of Baal. And that's something that you actually don't see very often in the Bible where the tool to kind of bring back order is through mockery. And so this is what we're seeing with this pip.

Speaker 1:          11:14          A figure is that pep a is like a, it's like an inversion machine. Okay. So, so, so the, the people who use pippy, what they do is they take something like an insult that's being thrown at them and they flip it around, flip it around on those that insulted them. Like that's what you did with the kermit thing, which is perfect. You, you see people are making fun of you because they say you sound like kermit and you're saying, okay, I'm going to take this and I'm going to make it into my strength. And that's what pip a pip. It does. And so a lot of the crazy stuff that's coming out of this tip, a thing is, is, is, is part of that. There's a lot of dark things in, in the Pipa, you know, like things that like personally I wouldn't want to touch.

Speaker 2:          11:54          When I first saw the frog the frog, I really recoiled from it. It's, it's got this kind of underground comic horror associated with it that I really, I really find distasteful. So like sort of viscerally distasteful.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Yeah, but I think it's supposed, it's kind of supposed to do that to you in that part of the power of, of those that are using that, that image, like it's right there. If you look at it, it's right there. And the first comic, like the first hippie comic, you know, you have a very crass but, but here's this, this frog, right? Who, who goes to the toilet to urinate, but he pulls his pants down to his knees and so he's doing something that usually you, if you pull your pants down to your knees, you're going to sit and do something else. But then he does that. But he stands. And so here's this. And he shows us his backside, right? So here's this, this strange power of inversion, which actually brings the man to stand back up. And so that's this double inversion that people who use this, this, this type of imagery are doing.

Speaker 1:          12:55          And so even it's like, you know, let's say like the radical left wing saying your, your, this, whatever, you're a white male controlling Blahblahblahblahblah, you're all these things. And the people who use these pepe comics there, they say yes, and they'll, and they reflect that to you. And then the people who were accused them of that completely lose their mind. They completely lose their mind. But the only thing they're doing is saying, you're saying, let's say that I'm a racist, this blah blah blah. And then they reflect that back to them. They invert it in a way because they're saying, here you go, I'll show you what you're telling me I am. And then, and then the, you know, the, the left, the radical left wing lose their mind. And so it's like. And so it's kind of. And if you look at those people like the alt right people, they have this strange, strange magic, right?

Speaker 1:          13:43          Because look at, if you look at Milo is Milo Yiannopoulos is a perfect example. You know, here is a half Greek, half Jewish, gay Catholic, trump supporting enrichment Englishman in America. And, and so not talking to the Republicans. Exactly. And so nothing people can throw it in and we'll stick on him because he is the frog. Like he is that marginal figure standing on the side, but he's, he's, he's like, he is that double in virgin and he, he's kind of, I know if he's trying, but what it seems like he's doing is bringing order back through like this double flip that's happening. It's very odd. It's very odd. Very strange. It's very strange time. So anyways, I would just say just just, I mean, just be careful. It's a dangerous place to stand.

Speaker 2:          14:31          Yeah, I'm, yes, I'm trying to be careful. Believe me, I've got lots of people that I'm talking to that are helping me formulate my arguments and articulate them properly and like I'm doing my best to keep my feet on the ground and my eyes open and, and, and not to be angry about this, but to be in the chaos really. And not assume also that that's a catastrophe because I don't know what's going to happen to me. I don't know if this is the worst thing that ever happened to me or the best thing that ever happened to me. I can't tell.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Yeah. And what'd you, what the solution will happen inside the chaos, right? The, the, the, the, the Jonah gets pulled down by the whale down into the depths of the, uh, of the, of the ocean and it's while he's in the belly of the whale, that the solution comes to him like his face, if he, he has, he has this moment of repentance where he turns, he turns around. Repentance is a flipping around and so that the moment that he brings him into death, turns into this baptism where he comes out and he's, you know, and he's a, he's a, he goes into the city, right? So that's another part, but, but, but, so that, yeah, the solution is going to come out of this chaos right now. It's still great

Speaker 2:          15:43          problem. If it's a really complex problem, you have to go very far into chaos to find a solution.

Speaker 1:          15:48          But there's always the risk of losing yourself when you're in chaos. So that. Right.

Speaker 2:          15:53          Well, that's right. I mean, that's the thing about dragons is that they can eat you. Yeah. That's why I don't like the new age, age suffocation of Carl Young, stinking and in part, I think Joseph Campbell was responsible for that, although he did a lot of very good things. I mean, the thing about the thing about confronting the thing that you're afraid of is that the thing that you're afraid of is genuinely terrifying and it can actually eat you and it's eaten plenty of people before you. And so it's no joke and you know what I mean? During this whole, let's call it ride so far. I mean, what, yeah, what was going to happen, and especially in the first couple of weeks, I mean, when I was being called a bigot, transphobic, all of those things and being pilloried essentially, at least within the university for my views, um, it wasn't obvious at all that there was going to be any, uh, there was going to be any way of swimming out of it, let's say. So,

Speaker 1:          16:50          but it's uh, it's, it's very, it's very disturbing because now you have, you basically have these two monsters fighting each other, you know, like that you have, let's say this pepe type frog and you know, the Hippie was declared a hate, uh, hate symbol by the Anti Defamation League. You know, that. I mean, that's very frightening. It's frightening that this is how far it's gone, how much. It's like, you know, all of a sudden they see that they can see the monster on the other side, but they don't see the monster on their side, you know, and, and the, the LGBTQ, etc. Etc. I mEan, that is itself a, a liminal forum. Look

Speaker 2:          17:31          what's happening with it. It's the same thing that, that happened with the gender neutral pronouns. As soon as you blew the binary apart, there was an endless multiplication of potential identities. Now was the chaos manifesting itself and the ever expanding letters that go along with lbgt is an example of exactly the same thing. It's like, well, we're marginalized. Well, we're marginalized too. Well, we're marginalized too. And how about us were also marginalized and it's like, and I guess that's also partly because each person has at least one element of that seriously marginalized, marginalized in some manner. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:08          Yeah. And the rain. and it's interesting like the rainbow is a, is actually a perfect symbol because a rainbow is, is, is, is actually, is, uh, is just a, uh, it's, it's a fluid thing. It is a fluid thing or rambo is not six colors or rainbow is a spectrum of colors and there's, there's, it is chaos itself. It's the division of order into an indefinite amount of things. Right? So we, we, we, we typify a rainbow into six coLors but, but it's actually just the spectrum of. And so it is in definitively, it can be separated indefinitely, right? It's no limit to how much it can be.

Speaker 2:          18:45          It seems to me that that's actually the problem with the identity legislation. It's like, well, like marriage, isn't that like an identity is a very important thing, right? And identity is something you have, but it's also something that you and I play out. So you have to negotiate your identity with the rest of the social world. It's like a game in some sense, but identity also has to have a function like, and this is also why the legislation is so pernicious because it just says, well your identity is whatever you want it to be. And it's like, well no, it's not because you have to live with other people. It's like, it's like saying you can play whatever game you want to play. it's like, well you can't because you got to get people to play with. That's right. We were playIng together and you can say, well you have to play my game.

Speaker 2:          19:28          Well I can tell you toddlers on the, on the school ground who say you have to play my game. They just get shunned and then the game itself has to be playable. That's the other thing is that there, there, there are playable and non playable games and one of the things that piaget pointed out, the developmental psychologist piaget pointed out about a game is that one of the hallmarks of an acceptable game is that people want to play it voluntarily. And that's another part of the legislation that's so pernicious. It's like, okay, you have a game and it's a game that you've chosen subjectively, because that's what it says in the legislation and when, when you come near me, you have to play my game whether you want to or not. And then the problem with that too is that, well where does that stop? And the answer is it stops with indefinite multiplication. So the whole point of society is to enforce a game that somewhat arbitrary that everyone can more or less play. They sacrifice parts of themselves to play it, but it it, it beats the total chaos of, of, of the war against, of all, against all. For example, that's the hobbs zen right nightmare, right? And life is nasty, brutish and short.

Speaker 1:          20:38          This is A compliment to the discussion of the metaphysics of pepe. The frog that I had with Dr. Jordan Peterson. There are strains, transformations happening our world,

Speaker 3:          20:48          and hopefully understanding them will prevent the worst from taking shape. As I discussed with Dr. Peterson, the frog is a type of hybridity as an amphibian. It exists in two worlds. At the same time, so it becomes an image of the margin. Another possible aspect of the margin and the monster as we encounter it, is to be a shapeshifter shapeshift shifting like hybridity is the sign of the place where categories fall apart on the edge. In the case of shape shifting. This characteristic because presented mostly as a power of the margin, is the power of fluidity like a trickster, taking on several forms to operate his mischief. To fully understand how pepe the frog operates, we need to understand how shape shifting occurs and how it gives power to those who wield it. You see, pepe has become a meme, possibly the most used meme of all times, his images floating on the internet and it can be produced by anyone in the world, and so there are thousands and thousands of images of pepe ranging from a glorified emoji to the most horrifying scatological images you can imagine because pepe has become this chaotic, fluid shape shifting thing. He ends up acting like a mirror in the same way water acts as a mirror,

Speaker 3:          22:18          and the way that works is that because there are so many images of pepe, when people look into that huge chaos of images, they can't encompass it, all of it. They have to mentally order it and in ordering it they do that using their own mental patterns, but as they project their thinking into this chaos and as they forced the chaos to take shape becomes an image of their own ideas, maybe their own ideological possession,

Speaker 3:          22:56          and so one of the things that has been happening is that some people on the right what, what some groups are calling the alt righter or whatever have been using this effect to act as a mirror against the social justice warrior types and even went so far that the sjws finally declared pip a hate symbol. The aNti defamation league said that pepe was a hate symbol. I mean this frog, this cartoon frog. It was so ridiculous that the adl finally scaled back. Some of the language they use. I mean, of course it was politically motivated, but how could such a silly thing happen? Well, certain images of pepe, a few of them in the thousands, thousands of images available had racist themes and so there was a hitler pepe and a k, k, k dot pepe, scheming jus african stereotyped using racist slurs, cliche mexicans. All of these examples were floating with the other thousands and thousands of peppa images online, but when the social justice warriors looked in this mirror, this pond of pepe images, all they could see were the ones that reflected back to them their own ideology or rather like a mirror, an inversion, the dark shadow of their ideology.

Speaker 3:          24:30          Of course, immediately the accusation came that bay is a racist symbol. He's a hate image and the irony is very big because first of all, no one controls this image. No one has any control over it. Pepe is everything and anything and nothing at the same time by declaring publicly that he's a hate symbol. That's two are pointing to their own absurdity and this to the delight of those that use this image, but heidi in this is an even larger ird. If you look at the images that they pulled out as being racist images. There's this strange contradiction in though. You see on one side there is hitler pepe and kkk pepe, and there's a trump pepe. Well, on the other side, there's the scheming jew, the african american, and the mexican. This means that pepe is that the same time the archetipal oppressor seemed from the side of the victim, all the while being the archetypical scapegoat seen from the side of the oppressor, that it's pepe is both sides of racism. At the same time, when the sjws look at that automatically without even thinking, they organize it through the ideology and it exposes their program because the automatically decide that when pepe is hitler or kick a care, trump pipa is identifying with those people, but when he's a scheming jew or a mexican, pipa is mocking and criticizing those people.

Speaker 3:          26:19          Why is such an absurd image of hitler as a cartoon frog not seen as mocking hitler,

Speaker 4:          26:26          in fact,

Speaker 3:          26:29          all the stw users seeing is a reflection of themselves, of their nightmare, of their shadow.

Speaker 3:          26:37          The rather pathological desire we've seen in the past few months to accuse everyone being hitler or a neo nazi or a white nationalist is an expression of their secret desire, the desire to be confirmed through an encounter with their projected other, and it's funny because the discourse of otherness has been an ideological tool of the left since the 19 sixties and now we're at a time when it has come back to haunt them. So by using this strategy, the people have been wielding this pepper image have taken advantage of the power of chaos, taken advantage of what happens when the frog jumps into the pond and goes down to the bottom to find the golden ball. As I explained in my interview with Dr. Peterson about the story of the princess and the frog, but the frog can't stay in the water forever. That's the most important thing. At some point you have to finish the story

Speaker 3:          27:51          to finish the story of the frog has to get the golden ball and one could say that the golden ball is actually the sun which will come up for the new day. The frog has to get the golden ball and bring it back to the surface of the water. It must carry the most important thing, carry the seed of the new world to the princess so that it can grow. If that doesn't happen, there is no telling what else can come out of the water. If the frog stays there for too long, it will be eaten or it will call some dark or monster because there are other things down there beside the golden ball and the frog contempt, the leviathan to devour it, and it's not as if this is impossible. As the frog swims in the darkness, the social justice warriors still peering into the mirror and calling forth its shadow. You've already seen some intimations that this game, people are playing my race, something more than a new day. Mike, raise the very monster, the social justice warriors hope to encounter so as the frog swims in the water. How? How can it do that? How can it recognize the golden ball that is at the bottom of the pond because it's actually not easy to distinguish things when we're covered in darkness

Speaker 3:          29:30          and the answer to this is in what happens in the story. The frog has to get out of the water and become a prince. The frog has to become something else and bringing up the golden ball is the same thing as the transformation of the frog into a prince. One cannot happen without the other, and so as Dr. Peterson is often suggested in his lectures, the way to do it is to sort ourselves out, is to go into our own self, define the golden ball that is hidden in the darkness, to go down and find the most important thing of western civilization. And Dr. Peterson has suggested the most important thing of western civilization is the logos. This truth, that is the Word we have seen. How noise has been the chaos used to drown the word.

Speaker 4:          30:39          What I'm going to talk about, what is freedom of speech? I want to tell you a few things about taking off this very carefully. I've been thinking about this very carefully over the last two weeks because of the videos,

Speaker 3:          31:04          and so we must find the word for it is the sun that rises after darkness. The word is the thing that comes out of death and lives again.
