Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello and welcome to this special edition of under the skin with me Russell brand. I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr Jordan Peterson. I've spoken to him before, but this special commemorative was not really a commemorative chat. It's not a tea towel for the royal wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. It's a to celebrate the release on paper back of my book recovery. And look at it now on Amazon. It's six pound 50, I think might be six pound, 47. We talk about that book recovery. We talked about the principles of recovery is a road to enlightenment. We talk about Dr Peterson's book. 12 rules for life is an interesting chat. Talking about myth. We do of course go through some of the main stays of Professor Peterson's, uh, a water cannon of ideas that you commonly talked about. But also I think we really get to the heart of it and discover some. Uh, some people think there is an exclusion of warmth that I think sometimes when talking about and his ideas and he's insistent on individual culpability and responsibility, we get into that stuff quite deeply. I think it's a great chat. Those you don't know who Jordan Peterson is yet. We're. Have you been obviously not watching him at the Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000 others, so yeah, we're talking to Jordan Peterson. I'm amber skin. Thanks for joining me and do check out my book recovery on paperback. Thank you

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       Dr Jordan Peterson. Thank you for coming on under the skin. It's lovely to see you again. It's good to see you too. It's nice to meet in London. It's different, isn't it? We're both of us were exiled in Los Angeles in our last conversation, but I enjoyed it very much. I've got a lot from it. I'm happy to talk to you on. This is very much home turf for me. Now. We're in London. We're in a publishing office. You've been promoting your book opportunity. That's why you're here. A couple of public lectures. How do you find that now? How do you finding what I thought in a way I've been comparing you to the British opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing this for ages and now you're experiencing a, uh, an almost perhaps unprecedented level of attention, but I'm assuming that your skill set is applicable.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       You're a lecturer, you're a clinical psycho analyst, so it's not like, oh my God, there's cameras. Right, right. Well, I mean the, the, the large scale lectures aren't doing, aren't that much different in kind from the lectures I was doing at the university. I mean the venues are larger and. Yeah. But the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats, I think maybe there were. Yeah, there were 5,000 at the Apollo. Well, that's where you're not nervous. I'm not as nervous doing that as I am often going to talk to journalists, individual journalists because like the thing about those venues, there's a variety of things about them that work in my favor. I mean, I like talking to crowds, you know, I've always enjoyed lecturing and so lecturing to several thousand people isn't much different than lecturing to several hundred people. But I also know that the people who've come are there happy to be there, like I'm, I'm, I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and so, and it's all, all of the details are essentially under my control.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       So. So it's not, it, it, I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit. I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand because, well, because you should be, you know, I want to do a good job and I want to make sure things go well and I want to get through the material properly and, and, and get a little farther in my thinking than I have been in and I'm trying to make each time I lecture better than the last time and I don't obviously, I always don't succeed at that. But. But it's good. I'm enjoying it. And my wife is very good travel companion. She's very stable and she helps me plan my days and so we've got it down to a bit of a routine. I would say Tammy is in the room with us. We have already met previously in Los Angeles. You wouldn't be on my, there isn't my, it's just in case listeners are wondering why perhaps they might be able to detect my voice.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       I'm occasionally glancing towards the spouse. The reason is because I am now. Well, I'm curious, when you're doing these lectures, is there not a performance component? Do you not feel? Definitely, yeah. Well sure. I mean a lecture theater is a theater. You and, and lecture is a form of theater now. It's a serious form of theater, but theater can be serious. No one and there's a seat because partly what I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas to an audience, but I'm also modeling the act of engaging with ideas and that's the theatrical at end of it and I don't give the same talk twice. Like I have my stories and I have my collection of things I know and I talk about, but I try to. I try to do two things. I try to. I'm always talking to specific individuals in the audience and so I'm having a conversation with the audience and so that's, that's part of the dynamic element of the performance.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       And the other thing I'm trying to do is to further my thinking on the topics that I'm addressing and there is a theatrical element to that because it's, it's like, I think the closest thing really that it compares to is probably stand up comedy, although I think the routines that comedians have are probably more well and formally practiced than the ones that, that, you know, than, than the, than the talks that I, that I engage in. I don't really think of it as delivering a lecture to an audience. I'm trying to think about complicated things in real time with an audience there to participate and to use the audience as an indicator of whether what I'm saying is gripping and comprehensible you apprehension and, and, uh, understandable Adrenalin prior to going on stage doesn't lead you to lean into stick in it, which would be the opposite of what you're describing. One, to remain

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       engaged in a kind of dialectic process of discovery. Because I thought, I mean obviously I am a comedian. So like for, for us, I would argue there is a, there is a distinction between performing for before 200 people or 5,000 people around 200. I feel like I'm very relaxed, I'm comfortable. I feel like I've got a lot of space in there. A $5,000 like sharpen up. Now you've got no room particularly because the other crucial difference is there needs to be a laugh every 20, 30 seconds. If there isn't, it gets pretty frosty up. There is, it is appealing to me as a comedian that's interested in interested in furthering intellectual debate, looking at the new intersections between politics and spirituality. Perhaps they've always been there. These are some, these evaporating context. The emergence of new ideas perhaps perhaps best exemplified by your own particular trajectory is interesting to me that that these spaces are now becoming available for forms of types of performance that aren't so contingent. It is on rapture and planner.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       Right? I know it is a very strange thing and I'm not sure what to make of it. You know, you see Sam Harris doing something quite similar. Richard Dawkins is doing something quite similar and, and it's, it's, I mean I was thinking because I've been trying to conceptualize this and, and one one comparable audience or one comparable situation is probably that of, of standup comedians. Another I suspect are traveling evangelists eventually it evangelical type. Yeah. No, because there. But of course what they're doing is explicitly religious. This is this, this has elements of both of those. And what's emerging that's so interesting is that there's a clear public appetite for high level intellectual conversation. If it's, if it's dynamic and I don't know what, what's accounting for that, all of a sudden maybe it's because these sorts of discussions aren't taking place like they should in the classical media space.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       You might be right there. Jordan, I mean to slightly mangle to slightly mangled the young quote that you use in your book. I'm 12 rules. I'm really enjoying actually, uh, like the one could infer motivation from results perhaps is that the political discourse, social discourse has become superficial and detached from meaning from purpose, from experience. That there is an opening appetite for substance that people are starting to. What you know, and, and, and as you said about theater before, you know, the origins of theater and the origins of religion are closely connected and both of them still our debt or at least functionally must relate to meaning purpose, giving us stories that help illuminate

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       the path. I think that. I think that's, that's, that's there's something about that that's profoundly correct. I think that know that the New York Times has recently written about the rise of the so called intellectual dark web, which is a term that Eric Weinstein so brilliantly coined, I would say. And, and very thoughtfully. Um, I think that the thing that unites the people who are loosely grouped into that collection is that they are having serious conversations with an audience that they respect and they're very diverse range of people. They don't certainly don't like salmon. Sam Harris and I disagree about many things for example, and uh, but Sam respects his audiences and he's, and he's engaging them in extremely serious discourse about very deep topics now about the structure of reality actually and, and the relationship between science and religion and, and, and the. And I think it is a consequence of the fact that not only has our public discourse, let's say in the media and in politics become shallow.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       I think it's become unbearably shallow in the universities. So yeah, well, because it's become so ideological, you know, and it's just not helpful. Look, I was interviewed by a New York Times journalist last week. A Nelly was her name and she's going to publish this on Sunday and she did a literature degree at Columbia and she told me that she was quite appalled actually by her degree, uh, especially in, in, in hindsight, she told me that she didn't know until she graduated, that there was any other way of reading great literature than through a postmodern lense. And the postmodern lens takes a book and basically you take a book, whatever it happens to be, and you decide which power hierarchy the author was serving and who is he, who he or she has excluded from consideration. So it's completely read through a political lens as if the book is nothing but a tool of political and economic domination essentially.

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       And that's the assumption. And like, look, everything's contaminated by politics and power to some degree, right? But that doesn't mean that there's nothing to art and literature except in service of, of like group domination. It's an appalling way of looking at the world. It would be an extraordinary bias to bring to Jane. Eyre is difficult to sort of make sense of it through that Lens. Then of course in economics and politics, like, yeah, of course important themes are going to be present in great works of art, but uh, I, I'm interest. They're still great works of art. That's the thing. And it's like, well, even even with something as transient as comedy, let's say mean you can't reduce comedy to the political or the economic and, and, and, and comics who become too ideological, let's say, like musicians who become too ideological. They're just not funny anymore. You have to be, I mean, you can have your viewpoint left or right, that's fine and people do, but you have to be able to transcend that viewpoint continually and you have to be able to criticize it because otherwise you're not a music. You just become a demagogue of sorts. Yes. I would agree that once there's a rubric to which you

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       come in slave, that becomes a dogmatic then, then there's no room for nuance. There's no room for hypocrisy. Humor, the transcendent Mirth, chaos. These forces need to be unleashed.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       There's also things you can no longer laugh about because you're, you know, you're so committed to your axioms. You can't, you, you dare not transgress against them. And if that's deadly, if you're a comedian, because the rule for comedy would be, and this is something I like about, about Sarah Silverman for example, is she will say anything if she thinks it's funny. She's very daring in that manner and like I've heard her tell jokes that, you know, really would curl your hair, you know, but you can tell by watching or something will pop into her head and part of her golf, tennis, I don't know if I should say this and then she'll say it and it's often like horribly funny and horribly funny. Is a good kind of funny. I mean it's, it's, it's daring and, and it's something I really admire about comedians too, is that they'll, they'll take that risk and, and it's something also that I've found disturbing about with regards to the many things I find disturbing about university campuses is that so many comedians won't go perform on university campuses anymore because they can't be funny. People get offended and it's a false. So fan of offended.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       I think you're right. I mean I think it's like a kind of Simon says type of a like, do you know that game? Do you have that game in your language? Just like are there certain things that we know we're not allowed to say. There's certain things that we know we're supposed to think. There's a kind of a, a kind of form you like Donald's a courtly behavior, I've heard it referred to as that we are meant to pay homage to a particular type of set of protocols and manners and it's not necessarily anchored to a real. Morality is not anchored to a sort of a sense of spirit to a sense of love or kindness is about like, these are the rules that we abide by. I want to talk to you a bit about, uh, the 12 steps and the model for handling addiction that I've written about myself in my book recovery because I want to see what you think of it like so like the 12 steps have anonymous fellowships, which I, if I were to belong to them, I wouldn't be able to say I belong to them without breaching their code of anonymity.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       But uh, the, what's positive about this approach to addiction is a, as we have discussed off Mike, a vet, it creates community like the other people that I've got a similar endeavor. And in fact it was young, the identified this, this solution. He said that like, people that have got chronic addiction addiction issues will struggle to change unless they have a spiritual realization of some kind on the support for community. Yeah. Well, I'm the spiritual realization component that's supported by

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       the relevant addiction literature. One of the classic cures for addiction is spiritual transformation and the hardcore scientists have laid that out as as a reality in the addiction literature degree because the ease more secular language around that as spiritual transformation could just be a change of perspective or a renewal, a radical change of perspective from an a and it typically in my experience, that's from a self centered view of self obsessive view about gain, your own needs met a solid cystic narcissistic perspective of low life is this is just an adventure where I go around trying to accumulate and accrue to, Oh wow, I'm here to be of service. That's of the transition in right microscopically, but in addition to a community like having connections between one another, the 12 steps themselves I think are an interesting model for transformation and shouldn't be overlooked and in fact, what my book was about is could that method be transposed to anybody who's interested in change?

Speaker 3:          00:15:53       So I wanted to talk to you about that to get your perspective on them. The first step is acknowledging that you were powerless over our addiction in your life has become unmanageable. Just admitted this, I don't want to be in this situation. Okay, so there's two parts to that admission. A one is that you're in trouble. Yeah, and I guess there's three. You're in trouble and it's serious. Things could be better and you don't have the wherewithal at the moment to make them better. So the thing that's interesting about that is there's a kind of radical humiliation and humility that goes along with that because you say, I have a problem and what I know at the moment isn't sufficient to solve it. Great. Because now you've opened yourself up to the possibility of learning something as you say, well, I don't know. I don't know enough to fix this.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       It's like, okay, well you could learn. And one of the things that's so interesting about people is that if they decide they have a problem and they also noticed that they could learn, the probability that they will learn goes way up. That's very interesting. You've actually conflated the first three steps there in your analysis of the first one because the first one is admission that there's a problem. The second one is recognizing that things could improve like counter believe that power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity and the third one is made a decision to turn our life and our will over to the care of God as we understood God. So like, you know, yeah. We could talk about that from a secular goes back. Well, we could talk about that from a secular perspective and say, well, there's a. there's a higher order moral principle that needs to be brought into the situation and you sort of described that right at the beginning of the question because you said, well, what?

Speaker 3:          00:17:24       Partly what you do when you move from an addicted state, from a psychological perspective is moved from a viewpoint of the gratification of immediate desire and and maybe the accumulation of things as a marker of success to the notion that no, you actually have a higher purpose and that higher purpose might involve being of service. That could be of service to yourself, which means you wouldn't be addicted anymore. Because that's not a good way of being, of service to yourself. But I've serviced to yourself and the broader community, however you might define that that's a higher order purpose and can integrate your motivations at at a level that doesn't leave you at the whim of impulse. That's the purpose of a higher order motivation. So okay, so we've got three. He asked that. That's the first phase to get you to that position where you're willing to change, believe in the possibility of change and accept help in order to achieve that change.

Speaker 3:          00:18:13       The fourth and fifth steps are about inventorying. Get like this is where the 12 step program becomes a fusion of spirituality and psychoanalysis because the fourth step is like a a four column method where you write down a list of all your resentments in your life and childhood resentments, have resentments against the government, people you work with, you write it all down, and then there's a diagnostic tool where you identify what it is in you that doesn't like that. And and also interestingly in a in 12 step theology that's called it, it says that anything, anytime that you are personally disturbed there is you have to take responsibility for it. To a degree, there is something in you that's been effective. It should at least ask yourself that question. Is it me or is it the world? Yes. Well, let's consider first the possibility that it might be.

Speaker 3:          00:19:03       I wrote about that in the sixth rule, right? Put Your assault how? Say around the house. Yes, yes. In fact, I've got our two Ra, like my idea to truncate it and somewhat more as a linguistically explicit explosive Laden version of the 12 steps. And I've got your 12 rules for life here and they don't necessarily correlate, but like, because like you say your first one, stand up straight with your shoulders back. I that. So a great chapter I think I love about, you know, the lobster staff and they sort of the uh, the ancient, timeless, all, most roots of hierarchies and the chemicals that are at play. What's happening when you're, what, what is that play? When we talk about self esteem, I'm like, and this year, the sixth one set your own house in perfect order. I said before you criticize the world steps four and five in the, in a 12 step program, deal with that inventory.

Speaker 3:          00:19:52       What's going on in your life inventory, what your baggage is in your own personal opinion. I think it's very practical that it's like, well, let's say you want to fix up your house, which is actually quite a lot like fixing yourself up, which is a very common dream metaphor. Well, the first thing you want to do is go look around and see what needs to be fixed. You know, and, and the, the interesting thing about that, this is akin to what comedians do, is that as soon as you're willing to admit Comedians, look at a problem and then rise above it right away and make a joke about it. But as soon as you're willing to admit that you have a problem, then you're immediately contacted the part of yourself that's at least strong enough to admit that you have a problem. And so as soon as the act of admitting the problem is actually the first step to solving it.

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       So you might say, well, and it it's an optimistic step because you might say, oh my God, I can't admit to that I have a problem because what if I can't solve it or. Exactly. So then maybe you won't admit to it. If you do to it, you're simultaneously admitting to the possibility that you could solve it and then it can actually become something that's optimistic. You can say, well, my life is horrible. It's like, okay, but I'm doing 50 things wrong. Well Great. I can fix those things and then maybe it wouldn't be so horrible. It demonstrated the admission itself demonstrates progression and possibility for further progression. I think it relates. That's why humility is always stressed in, in, in great religious traditions. Humility is precisely that. It's like you have to look at why you're not so good. Yeah, and and you know that that has to break down your pride to some degree in your arrogance.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       It's like, well that's great because if you break down your pride and your arrogance, then you're primed to learn and you can solve your problems. So there's nothing in that. It's a bit crushing to begin with because you might think, oh my God, there's really a lot of things wrong with me, but at least then you're on the on the road to fixing them. My personal journey of recovery has been like a kind of death, a light, you know, like when I was 27 it was like the death of the drug addict self. That guy does funny because I told Tammy when we were coming here today that when you were 27, you made the decision to live. I knew it was 27 because that's when people, I'm going to say like you, but you know, celebrities who, who are sort of on fire, they die all the time at 27 because they don't make that decision.

Speaker 3:          00:22:04       They decided that they don't decide that they're going to take that final step into maturation. They want to hold onto that Peter Pan thing, that, that pause. You bet you exactly that. They want to hold onto that and you can't hold onto that and live yes, and then there's a further death. I'm noticing now in my early forties so that are now at the midway point have been made in that sort of Dante, esquire and now I'm moving towards the grave and now I'm like, there's a different kind of alertness and merging and back to this step, four and five minutes in this process of inventorying. After you've might an imagery and you've, you've correctly, you've honestly and openly put down everything, incidents of child abuse, things that you've said to other people, things that your shame. Once you've been willing to inscribe your shame, then you tell another person, a person that you trust.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       In the original literature it says, you know, it could be a cleric, a doctor, or wherever. It typically in a 12 step structures. It's like a mentor figure, but that has the. That's the role of confession, which obviously a huge part of psychoanalysis. The point in your book, I think this pertains to is when you took like the Dragon and the dragon gave that. You said there was that Kid's book that you read where it talks about the dragon getting bigger and bigger. If it's not identified. I think four and five are somewhat like that. Yeah. Well, in part of the point of that kid's book is that as soon as you turn around and look at something, it tends to shrink and that's partly because imagine that you have a memory that you won't confront. Well, there's something in that memory that's terrifying, but and that means it's sort of associated with everything else that's terrifying and so it's horror.

Speaker 3:          00:23:41       It's horrible, but then when you turn around and look at it, you think, yeah, it's horrible, but it's horrible in this precise and defined way, and that takes it away from all the other potential horrors of it. It starts to shrink it right away and also makes you into the thing that can turn around and look at the horror, which is a real, real positive transformation lacked on your part. So it's true that somehow in the being, being prescriptive and being specific, the problem becomes manageable because it's limitless, not fuel. It becomes a apocalyptic in the end. What? What's the worst thing that Kevin is? I could be destroyed and everyone I love could be destroyed itself, could be destroyed. And until you say, well actually know what this is is you feel inadequate because you weren't role multiple. Correct. All right, well I can maybe take care of that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:28       Right? There's still bad, but it's not everything. And then you, you phrased that exactly right. Is that without that attentive delimiting it becomes apocalyptic. That. And that's a very, very old idea. So one of the things that happens in the Mesopotamian creation myth, Enuma elish, is that the gods are created. They're, they're the, they're the offspring of chaos. That's a good way of thinking about it and they become very careless and they destroy their category system. They destroy their father essentially and chaos comes flooding back. And that's what happens to people who aren't looking at things and delimiting them properly. They become up apocalyptic and do the mint. So, but sometimes in a mythology there is the positive too, confronting confronting of the God age promethium. So sometimes we need to steal, steal the fire. Sometimes we need to challenge these orthodoxies, don't we? Yes sir.

Speaker 3:          00:25:20       Absolutely. I mean, part part of the well, part of the death that you're describing is actually the confrontation with a form of tyrant, like your previously addicted self was the tyrant over your emergent self. Yes, and so it's an internal tyrant and you said it was predicated on a false value system. That's a false set of gods essentially, and so you had to confront that. That is a kind of death. I also think that some the addiction or addictive tendencies, and I don't mean as severe as chemical dependency or forms of addiction addiction or a kind of self constructed formaldehyde to preserve you in the state of trauma, but trauma is acknowledged. No means to navigate trauma are present because of the isolation, because you have no mentor, you have no. You have no doctrine, you have no community, so addiction steps in, this is how our preserved, this is how I will not die.

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       I will find this notice that is a habit, a repeated pattern to sustain you, a holding pattern so that you don't die because there is no way out. There's no guide, there's no path. You're just in the forest and there isn't a way out, so I thought that addiction for a personal experience in that I hope and suspect more broadly is a means for sort of status for preservation after trauma. The rupture occurs is not addressed and a means for survival emerges in the form of addiction. Addiction is not your nemesis is your friend, at least while you're in, whilst you're in. There's certainly a literature on addiction that indicates that many people use addictive substances as a form of self medication and they tend to find the drug that best, best medicates them, let's say. And for different people. That's different. Drugs. Alcohol, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       Now say one of the other things that I'm proposing in my book is to use one of the grandiose terminology is that the, uh, they template for a recovery from obvious forms of addiction could be applicable to less evident forms of addiction, just patterns and habits. And because so far the things that you've laid out would be, would be in keeping with that idea. Well, you admit to the problem. I really also, I think the idea of laying out your resentments is unbelievably useful because that's also a way of dealing with the malevolence within you that might interfere with your own recovery because you're angry at yourself. If you're angry at your parents, if you're angry at the world, the probability that you're going to be in the mental state that's going to allow you to chart a positive course for yourself is very, very low.

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       How can you have a clear and authentic relationship with your wife if you've not correctly understood what you feel about your own mother? If you feel like that you are enmeshed or trapped in some way? How am I supposed to have or have not understood that if I've not gained a new perspective, if I've not transcended it by sharing is another person that in in the sleeping beauty story and the Disney story, when the prince is encapsulated in the castle, in the dungeon at the end and before he goes and rescues sleeping, beauty, he has to confront his terrible mother. She turns into the dragon of chaos itself. He has to use honesty and truth to confront her, and until he does that, he can't free the maiden from her sleep. Yeah, so that's called the, that's called the freeing of the anima from the negative mother archetype and union psychology.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       It's precisely that and that, and that negative feminine will be overlaid on your partner unless you, unless you're able to clarify it and clarify your relationship with it. And that could be something like overprotection or it could, you know, in your past or it could be neglect for that matter, or it could be the rejection at many at the hands of many, many women before you encountered this woman that you were going to bring that bitterness forward as a kind of projection. If we are unwilling to undertake this kind of excavation, then we asked them to continually have relationships that are cutaneous. Just a superficial coordinates will govern our experience in relationships. Uh, so that's the repetition compulsion from a Freudian perspective is that, that isn't how Freud explained it. That's how I would explain it. But, but the simple explanation of it is, well, if you bring the same set of priests unexamined presuppositions to every situation, the same fate will play out. You might say, well, those women are the same. It's like, well actually no, but the part of the part of them that you're able to make contact with acts the same every time. That's a very different thing. Brilliant. And this is where six and seven, the next steps are chronologically occur, but

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       there's six. Having done this inventory, you recognize what patterns have been at play in your life, which particular in the lexicon of the recovery defects of character, of governed you often pride wanting to control other people's perspective, self pity, self centeredness, intolerance, inpatients, green jealousy, envy, lost slope for you. Identify the seven deadly sins and how they play out in your life essentially. Yes. And so, and you become in step six is about becoming willing to live differently. The saying, are you actually willing to let go of last? Are you or do you like lost when it comes to it, do you like being impatient? Does it serve you in some way? To be slothful, it's. It's highly probable that it does. Yeah. No, it's. It's, it's easy. It's gratifying. It's powerful, it's pleasurable, especially in the short term like there's lots of. There are reasons that people are tempted by by the seven deadly sins.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       Gloria, Gloria, and that's exactly right. There's a dark romantic and you really see that in the depths of celebrities around 27 is they. They fall in love with the allure of that kind of have that romantic death and he does the men, so the Anti Libido, that dark libido, that death force, so with the. Once you have diagnosed, which particular defects of character have been most prominent in your path and become willing to let go of them. This step seven is making a concerted and real effort to live without them and this is where it kind of comes down to sacrifice theory. That's what are you willing to sacrifice in order to move forward, you have to give up something that you love and you may have to give up the thing you love the best. That's the fundamental sacrificial motif. Sacrifices and the unattractive idea in our self.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       In in our society that's based on consuming and indulgence and this is not something that I would like. So this is again, perhaps you were you a nice I'm. What differ is that I would not, whilst this will not change about the individual's engagement or kind of step one and acknowledgement that needs to be changed. This is where I say there is a social responsibility, but for whatever reason our society has become a manifestation of these darker impulses. These are the prevalent forces, at least in the kind of society I live in. I think it was like to live in China or Libya. I'm just saying like in London, like what? Your emphasis on immediate gratification, too much emphasis on. Because immediate gratification is a tool of consumerism. This would be my argument. So like I it, but at this point in the program, it's where the spirituality becomes, I find personally undeniable. But you have to, uh, you have to call to something else. You have to in a sense, be lay yourself open. The idea of prayer becomes quite important now. So there's a, there's a union idea there. So the union self is the thing that guides the ego through transformations. So imagine the ego, which is what you think you are, or the thing about the ego is the ego can be wrong

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and the ego can die and be reborn. So what that indicates is that there's something underneath the Eagle can guide that process of transformation and partly what you're calling on when you call on this higher power is at least from a psychological perspective, it's a decision to rely on that thing that can guide you through transformation. Yes, because surely as we said in relation to another, we are likely relate into a set of coordinates that we impose on info commerce. The female. The same would be true of the cell that we have created an impression, an egoic impression we've constructed and our official self. But beneath it there is our higher self or an exterior self that comes often composed of. It's often composed of things that you refuse to or we're willing to develop. And so when young talks about, for example, the incorporation of the shadow is that you've constructed a Nigo and there's things it can do and can't do, that it's allowed to do and it isn't allowed to do, and then there's a shadow domain that would consist of those things that you could do but haven't.

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       And some of that's terrible, but some of it's what you need to break free. Is there a, a infinite variety in the shadow or are there sort of templates there? Would you say that you know, a common component of the last aggression aggression because they're the most. The mobilized, yeah. They're the two that are most difficult to integrate into the ego because aggression destroys and of course lost subsumes. The individual to, to, to well to sexual sexual desire is such a lust, isn't identified as a very powerful self. It can, it can subsume. So I suppose that's why a lot of theological doctrines focus on the control of last another. There is, of course, it's a disruptive force, you know, because for example, if you make a medium to longterm relationship with someone in new negotiate that that provides you with a stable structure that can operate across your entire life is good for you.

Speaker 3:          00:34:30       It's good for them, it's good for your kids, it's good for society, but then if you're really attracted to someone momentarily, you can be driven to act on that and and every, all the rest of that can burn up. It's not good, and so it's no wonder that it's viewed as a force of tremendous disruption. Now it's also a force of tremendous life, right? Because you want to be attracted to people. You want to have that, that, that vital libido as part of part of what's driving you forward, but hopefully it's on your side and not working against you. And so you know, if you're successful and you've put yourself together and you're disciplined, you should still be maximally sexually attractive, but it should be under your control. You're not a, you're not the puppet of that force anymore. It's integrated into you and that's a much better way to manage it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       How do you, in your understanding, how is the shadow incorporated? What rituals, what ceremonies, what behaviors successfully incorporate the shadow? Say in using the example of last week, what's a way back in for the sort of the that it's been disembodied or repressed or it's a safe way for it back? Is there one? Well, I think part of it is to, is to admit to your desires within your own relationship, you know, because you might say, well, I'm, I'm tired of my wife. It's like, well, yeah, maybe, maybe you're tired of the games that you're intelligent enough to play with your wife, but she's as plurry potential as you are, and so you have to admit to your desires, let's say, and maybe you have to make them consciously manifest within your own relationship and then you know, when people can do that, people do that by, by dressing up or by, by playing sexually, I would say.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       Yeah, play. Exactly. That plays a transformative element and that's it. You know, and it might be that you're uncomfortable with the idea of, of your wife as sexual play thing because you think that a woman who's married should be proper and Prim and should only behave sexually in a certain way, in which case, well, that becomes stale and dull and you're more likely to be tempted by something on the outside. For me, that's a very obvious example of how habitualized thinking is prohibitive even without reaching the extremes of self destructive, addictive tendencies. If I have a habit of regarding my wife as, as object day, even if that's not a objectification, is we're typically take care by limiting beliefs about my wife, that the tools that breakdown addictive, uh, thought patterns could be used to create new terrains, new liberty, new play. Thank you. Um, so like, so once you've done up to step seven, which is essentially a step seven, you're right, it's a sacrifice of the old self and handing over to the, some kind of sublime divine self.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       Um, the, the step eight is you make a list of people that you have harmed and become willing to make amends to them as you look back at your part and go, God, I shouldn't have stolen that. I shouldn't have done that. I treated that person badly. That was wrong. I lied. So it's moral, it becomes quite real repentance, right? And Atonement, atonement is at one meant. And if you're carrying transgressions that you regard as transcriptions now and your life, then you don't want to carry those for you want to, you want to, you want to step forward in life without that moral burden because you will have contempt for yourself otherwise, and you won't take care of yourself. It also, in a sense what you're talking about, about allowing lust backend incorporate in last. Then, uh, this is a more, a broader method for incorporating annexed aspects of the self.

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       Like, you know, how can you fully love? How can I fully love myself? I know I treated that person abominably well, if I go back and say that was wrong, I did you wrong. I owe you an amends. You, you invite that part of your life in you amended your path through life as well as teaching yourself that, that is not the way we proceed anymore. That step pay, and then that's a real. That's, that's taking our real action in the world. It's not a hypothetical at that point, right? It's kind of like telling people what you've written down about your, uh, about your faults. Yes. Yes. Because it makes it real. When you, when you're acting it out with someone else, it's not only a mental thing at that point. Furthermore indicates step by step a is done separate from the step eight is right up the list of people.

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       Step nine is now. Go through it. It makes the distinction, I think, to create a space for you where you're going, where you're not continually thinking, I'm not fucking doing that. I'm not going to apologize. I was abused by them. Fuck that. They did as much wrong as I did not. The point is not the point and also I think they might've done more wrong than you did, yes, but you're still stuck with the fact that you did something wrong. That's wrong, that's not good, and if you refuse to surmount the obstacle of like inner, some arbitrary measure of who is more wrong, then you continue to cast yourself in victim hood. That's you have no personal autonomy, so I choose to go for it. It doesn't matter if you're only five percent at fault and it also doesn't matter if the other person apologizes to you, they should.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       It would be better for them. It might make things lay out. That's not the point and this perhaps is where what I think is significant that now your life has become not negotiation between you and other be beings as they materially present themselves, but between yourself and this higher purpose that has been declared earlier, that you are now operating on the common spiritual plane. You are no longer about. If I do that, I'll get that. It precisely doesn't matter if a person goes, I don't care if you apologize or not. Religious language that would be expressed as the discovery of your father in heaven instead of your earthly father because your father in heaven would be the higher spiritual authority to which you owe allegiance and and you can think about that either in religious terms or a nonreligious terms, is that what you've done is you've been in some sense as you've abstracted the, the idea of a higher authority and a higher purpose and you've decided to devote yourself to that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       That's a religious app and that's precisely antithetical to postmodernism is saying that, no, no, no, no. There is an essence. There is a country, there is a way. There is a trust. That's right. That's, that's, that's what is precisely antithetical. Yes, because the postmodern claim is that there are multiple ways of looking at the world many ways, and that's true, but the antithesis of that is yes. Just because there's multiple ways of looking at the world doesn't mean there are multiple proper ways of looking at the wounds. In fact, there's a very narrow range of proper ways of looking at the world. My, my concern with atheism has always been it's sort of easy affiliation with nihilism or why don't we just wondering is fucking people. Then that sort of like, that's like that's where my mind immediately goes, if there is not an order, why not just smash everything to smithereens and you're saying ideologically that is what's happening ideologically with deconstructing God. We're the deconstructing morality with an agenda. We're deconstructing and that was the danger that both both nature and dusty Esq pointed to clearly. It's like you dispense with the transcendent principle and you open up the landscape for impulsive nihilism. What are they responding to? Post enlightenment rationalism. Is that what does the ski in nature or responding to why they weren't responding essentially to the idea of the death of God, both of them and that

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       explicitly and is an enlightenment idea. Like where is there, where is death of God happening at? The hair should be at the hands of a, of a kind of arrogant and narrow rationalism and the materialism. Yeah, and the exposition of the exponentially. That has led us to where we're going now, which is that kind of okay. Sort of digging the earth from beneath our feet, putting us to the base. That's, that's a. that's the hypothesis. Precisely. 10, 11. The last three steps. Step 10 is a like a continued to make inventory, so like let this process continued for me in psycho analytic terms. I'll see a therapist obviously like a lot is when like when there's a moment I know any spike in my energy if I go, oh, I felt so. That was interesting. I felt jealous there or I felt I felt small in that moment.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       These are the moments I know and go, oh, how was I participate in that? What belief of mine was being challenged? Is that a helpful belief? Belief being a thought that I like having a at 11, that's a kind of consciousness is like, well, I'm going to fall apart. I'm going to make mistakes. I don't want to make mistakes. I'm going to keep an eye out for when I do make mistakes and I'm going to make them conscious and then I'm going to try to work on them bringing them into into consciousness because my fear, my number one fear on a personal level and possibly on a social level, I don't know quite how to extrapolate or conflate those two notions is unconsciousness. I get very afraid when I'm dealing with unconscious individually when I'm. People don't know why they're doing what they're doing. He may see this in sort of violent rage or even in less dramatic theatrical behaviors feel.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       There's a great idea that works. At the bottom of the Christian mythological tradition is that a little bit of consciousness destroyed the original paradise. We became conscious enough to be aware of our own mortality, but the cure for that is way more consciousness, not a return to unconsciousness. Yes, there's no going back. There's no going back. I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie movies is they don't know they're already dead and like so like that. That danger of the Zombie is the danger of the desire for unconsciousness as a, as a solution to life's problems. And I think that this is again something we're being invited to participate in for consumerism that live your life continually on the frequency of unconscious energy, such a desire and fear that we're not being. We're not being invited to participate on the level of consciousness, conscious interaction, presence in the moment.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       While you could make the case if you made the case that consumerism promotes the gratification of immediate desires above all else. I think it does. That's my, that's what I'm pushing for. Um, with this original sin. Like, so a little bit of consciousness as a dangerous thing. We become with our vulnerability, our mortality, our nakedness and corporate real nature. But the solution to this is to become more conscious to we have to. So, uh, how do you, how was that? The Bible? Yes. Where does that get resolved? Normally they get kicked out of the garden.

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       Part of part of what happens in in the, in the redemptive story is if you think about Christ as a symbolic figure, say is symbolic of the process of transformation that we just described is one of the. One of the morals of the Christian passion is that you need to radically accept your limitations and so part of this keeping your sins before your eyes, which you just described. Here's all the ways that I fall short of the glory of God. Let's say, you know I make this mistake. I make this mistake, I make this mistake. That's all consciousness and it's painful, right? Because you think, well, you become more conscious. It's this glorious process of enlightenment and overall it is, but the details are exactly this. The things you need to become consciousness conscious of are precisely those things that you least want to become conscious of and that this is the motif that you identified in the alchemical tradition because the chemical, the chemical model, so to speak, was that which you most need to be found.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       That which you most need to find will be found where you least want to look. Right? Yes. And everyone knows that's true. Like you tell someone that they go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, I know that's true. So, and that's also the greatest barrier to enlightenment because if a night moon was all, you know, tulips in sunshine, then everyone would be enlightened, but it's not, it's this continual bringing before yourself all your proclivity for, for transgression. And that's that and that obviously because how are you going to solve your problems if you're not aware of them? He wouldn't want to be old discipline. Did a jeweled Jordan. Well, it's not surprising, but the alternative is far worse. That's the thing. And that is the district. Because I was very curious. I was very curious. Like I said, I talked about this with Tammy when we were coming here. I thought Russell decided to live when he was 27. I can't. I would like to know why. So why did you, why did you make the decision to, to not allow what was consuming you to kill you?

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       In a sense, it was taken out of my hands for the first time I encountered positive or mail or 40 figures who curiously like, or at least that we're able to address that in particular, I was sent to a treatment center. I had free mumps. I had time to think I timed to, uh, I, I passed from childhood directly into addictive behaviors. In fact, those addicted babies were already present in childhood in less toxic form in my relationship. In retrospect, fruit chocolate was addictive. My relationship with pornography as an adolescent addictive, I was using it to, for medical medical purposes. So, so when substances became an option in adolescence, it was seamless. And that meant that my emotional, my emotional growth was arrested at that point. The reason I was able to stop it because inadvertent, I was offered help. I got, I was given help our people that the management company that was working with say your serious drug addicts, you should go away.

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       Okay. So partly that meant that they re, they regarded

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       you as the sort of valuable commodity that was worth preserving. Yes. There was a degree of that. Right? Right. Well, no, but that's helpful. I mean regardless of. Even if it's purely an economic interest, there's, there's something to that. Yeah. So and so then you went into treatment and you find some people say the place that I went, it's run by an atheist chip summers, but the 12 step principles, you can't unpick it from the Oxford Group, first century Christian Group there and for me is more appealing when you talk about it in terms of though I have no problem with the sublime and the divine. I live for that shit. But like, like I was always trying to get out of my head off my face. Those were the things I want it a sublime experience experience of what is beyond the material. That's what I want to know.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       So, but once I was in that environment and given drugs to help where I was addicted to opiates, so I called subutex then and sleeping pills because I couldn't sleep. And during that time I suppose in a way I didn't fully address the issue of addiction because my. I was really promiscuous for about a decade, but I that, that behavior was transplant. It was kind of effortlessly, but I do remember a kind of moment of epiphany if apifany his revelation of previously concealed to truth when it first occurred to me, you, I suppose you don't have to take drugs every day. I remember that thought entering and it being sort of like, oh yeah, I never thought about that because that I'd found a solution. It worked and worked as a way of managing pain, prevent infoview mental investigation or discovery of conclusions that would have been unhelpful and that wouldn't have been able to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       I think in a lot of cases, and I'm sure there's many, many variables, uh, that, uh, that actually chemical dependency is a successful technique for preventing suicide. There is just, this is a holding pattern to stop me doing something more dramatic and band. Unless people have access to an ideology of structure and support that will help them through that. There's, it's very difficult to overcome. And I was fortunate in that I was granted that and then grant it this system. And so, and as I've been working it, I've come to the conclusion that it is possibly universal, not because I think it's derived from universal ideas. That's why I think young I've made that the identified some, like if there's a spiritual experience and then the support of community, that's how someone could be stopped from drinking, continually alcoholic drinking and then they took this process.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       They were 12 original 12 step fellowships, took the Oxford Group, had a program of a sort of redemption and restitution and you know, and like it, it seems initially in a, I think in a materialistic society, counterintuitive to think that the solution to addiction is going to be spirit, spiritual awakening. But that's what it is. And the, the final steps are stay connected once you like your continual inventorying for the moment. We think, oh, I felt something there that you want to be in the moment connected. Like I have to notice if I, if someone makes me feel inferior or if someone, if I'm sexually attracted to someone, those are the most obvious examples of something that will take me out of my connection. And then the final step is, uh, made a hell puffers and remain awake for it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       The Hero's journey is, once you go into the darkness and find something of value, the next thing to do is to distribute into distributed within the community to bring it back and distributed within the community.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       Now Jordan d, is it like it would be difficult for me to accept that you've not been a sort of personally affected and are not personally angry rather than just, um, objectively because your personal trajectory I suppose in the public eye at least began with the situation in Canada with a sort of forced speech or however it is termed now. So like that. Are you able to distinguish between your sort of sense of personal irritation? Because I think for most people telling me what were, whether or not you think that he's right there. Academia seems like I'm an and celery area. It doesn't seem mainstream to most people like, but to you it seems as though so very vital, but you are an academic.

Speaker 2:          00:51:48       Well, okay. So there's, there's two things there. I mean, people regard academia as ancillary, but it's not. The reason it's not is because the universities train the people who run things and so whatever's mainstream in the universities right now, even though it's separate from society is going to be mainstream everywhere five years down the road. And so that's, that's a big. Is the vanguard academically? No, there no doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       Do you think what's happening now in terms of a media and politics? You could, uh, could say you could preemptively if diagnosed that from what's happening five, 10 years years I

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       think. I think. I think that in some sense I was preemptively diagnosing it because I've been watching the politically correct postmodern types for quite a long time. And one of the C, one of the things I noticed about five years ago, six years ago, there were two things that I noticed that I really didn't like. The first is that because I'm a personality psychologist, as a researcher, not as a clinician, but as a researcher, I know the literature on gender differences in personality because it's part of my field and I could tell that I was starting to have some reluctance to deliver the lecture on gender differences and now I didn't stop, but I felt, I felt that I was treading on thin ice by delivering those lectures and I thought, oh, that's not good because I'm like a comedian. I'm pretty much willing to say anything that I think is true and, and you know, regardless of the consequences in some sense, because I'd rather take the consequences of what's true.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       And I thought this isn't good because if someone like me who's, you know, rather uncontrollably mouthy let's say, is starting to have second thoughts about teaching what's a very serious topic and, and something about which there's a very well developed science. Then how much are other people starting to censor? And at the same time, my students, many of whom were female, were telling me that they were really hesitant to talk about gender differences in any of the courses they were running. And I thought, oh, this is not good, this is seriously not good. And so, and it's certainly the case that, that my colleagues censor themselves increasingly on campus with regards to the topics they're willing to discuss. And it's subtle, you know, because imagine in a given lecture I could discuss any of 10 things and three of them are taboo. Well, I just won't discuss those.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       And that's that. That's kind of invisible censorship. It's not like I'll get up and say, look, I could have talked to you about gender differences in personality, but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just pick another topic because there's lots of topics to choose from. And that means there's going to be a bunch of topics that are really important because actually the issue of sex differences in personality happens to be really important that people just won't talk about. And the other thing that's so annoying about this is that, especially with regards to sex differences in personality, well, let's say, let's say that you're firmly on the side of women. Just for the sake of argument. Well, do you admit to or deny the existence of sex differences in personality? What's better for women? Well, you know, the radical leftist basically say, oh, well those, if you talk about sex differences, then you're part of the oppressive patriarchy and you're attributing to women a different kinds of temperament in the attempt to continue the suppression.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       But I could just as easily say, it's like, well, wait a second, like if you want to, if you want to, uh, give the individual the greatest degree of freedom, you say, look, you, you're different from another person. You're different on the basis of a variety of your characteristics. Sex being one of them that's going to have some effect on what sort of choices you want to make in your life. It's like go ahead and make whatever choices you want as far as their direct expression of your being. And so if you deny the existence of these sex differences, which no one knows, serious commentator in the psychological literature, in the personality domain, and those are the people that know about this thing, nobody debates whether or not sex differences in personality exist or that they have a biological component. No. And what's also interesting about that is that none of those people are conservatives. There are no conservative psychological researchers to speak up there in a tiny minority. So the people that have done the research indicating that there are differences between the sexes and personality and that those differences have a biological, in part a biological component. Those are liberal and left leaning. People who've drawn those conclusions despite their, you know, despite what their ideological presuppositions might have suggested to them to begin with. So, well, so you know, it's, I don't know what to say about that except that it's all appalling.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       I suppose the fear must be that difference will ultimately be used for

Speaker 2:          00:56:40       leverage for status. And that's a reasonable fear, you know, because because anything can be manipulated, but, but claims of identity can have identity of claims that, that people are identical in some way can also be used for the same reason. You know, if I insist that everyone is exactly the same on all dimensions, there's just as much of a totalitarian threat lurking in there as there is the threat lurking, that we'll use differences as an excuse. And we're also not having a serious discussion about this. It's like, yeah, there are men are overrepresented at the top of the economic apex. That's true. It's a small minority of men by the way. It's certainly not men in general, but there are radically underrepresented at the Bard overrepresented at the bottom. And believe me, man, like nobody cares about men who are failures. They are like off the bloody radar.

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       So, and, and there's no sympathy for men who are failures. So men stack up at the top and the bottom and, and, and we don't have a discussion about that and we don't have a discussion about the fact that women are radically underrepresented in dangerous jobs. Although they are or in or in or in in trades that require like brutal physical labor, women are radically underrepresented or in or in jobs outside. Women are radically underrepresented, so the complaint is always, well if you look at the top one percent, it's there are more men than there should be, you know, by pure sex division. It's like, well yeah, but if you look at the bottom, the reverse is true. So if we're gonna have the discussion which are, and I don't really necessarily think we should have that discussion, but if we're going to have the discussion then we should look across the entire economic spectrum.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       I wonder how much of this debate is being governed by unconscious forces. I wonder how much of what we're experiencing is a manifestation of a va on a well, we're cartography has not yet been a lot of it. What are you thinking about? Any particular part of it? What I feel like is that the reason that I say imagine that you are arguments that are based on research are so successful is because people are expressing feelings as opposed to cogent and researched arguments. It feels like there is a powerful, dominant patriarchy and no one can deny. I mean that there is power there such a thing as power and there are people that benefit from structures being as they are horse of class. The point of those structures being the, they are. One of the things I've observed is that whenever change is discussed, my tendency has always been to be sympathetic towards movements that are about change or empowerment of what might be termed disadvantaged groups.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       Um, the change is that when you are curious about the resistance of change or the difficulties that you face when trying to bring about change, look at who would be negatively impacted, where that changed to be bought about. Usually that means that there's some people for conservatism make sense to a particular group of people. One thing that I felt when I'm reading a book, whereas the, you know, like I, I, because I think you're coming from a perspective of psychoanalysis and it rings very. The language rings true and the analysis rings true. That what I, where I feel. One question I was keen to bring to you is when you talked about skateboarders in the, or I think it's the last but one chapter and that spirit of uh, uh, a young people, yeah, courage and a willingness to try dangerous things and push forward and I wonder how that sits with the idea of a, an earlier passage in the book where you talk about, uh, the gratitude that we should feel for, you know, having time to read a book and the ability to read a book and sort of respect for the establishment and systems that have been set up from which we all benefit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       Because when I, you know, I, I couldn't find it difficult to dispute your opinion about sort of churlish what would have been in the lexicon of the day social, social justice warriors and that kind of somewhat rootless unresearched. Right. You know, I, I, I, I identify what you're saying. There are people that can't keep their bedrooms tidy will be careful before you let them organize an economic system. But like, but, but similarly like, you know, where is change going to come from? Who are, who is going to challenge them? Huge

Speaker 2:          01:01:20       tyranny is it? Those are the sorts of twin forces that we have to contend with across the political spectrum, so I could run through something quickly to put the things that you just that you just brought up in, in, in perspective. Let's say. Okay, so the first thing is, is that hierarchies. If you're going to value some things more than others, then hierarchies are inevitable and you have to value some things more than others or you don't have anything. You all strength for something. Well, what competence or shirt, whatever, whatever it happens to be. The ability to play the flute, right? It doesn't matter why on my list. Well, what? What you know, obviously if you value music, then you're going to value some musicians more than others because some are better. So it's and so you have to value things in order to move forward in life and you have to value things in order to have something valuable to produce.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       But if you play out the value and the social landscape, you're going to produce a hierarchy. And the problem with producing a hierarchy is that a small number of people are going to be successful than the majority and a very large number of people aren't going to be successful at all at at that particular thing. It's inevitable. So okay, now. So. So you would say, well we have to put up with that because we need to pursue things of value. Okay, fine. So that's the right wing perspective is that the hierarchy's are justifiable, unnecessary. Now the left wing perspective is, yeah, but wait a minute. The problem with hierarchies is that people stock up at the bottom and that they tilt towards tyranny across time. And that's also true. And so you need that dialectic in society between the right wing that says, you know, we need the hierarchies and they're useful and you should be grateful for them and they structure you and give you form and provide value.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       And the left that says, yeah, but they exclude people and people stock up at the bottom and that's dangerous to the hierarchy itself. And it, it means that people might not have opportunity. And you have to say yes to that. The problem comes, and this is the situation we're in right now where the radical leftists, and this is mostly a problem that really permeates the universities. The radical left is say, yeah, but all hierarchies are just tyrannical power. It's like, oh no, they're not. Hierarchies are based on competence in a functioning society and mostly our society functions, so you need it. You can't go that far. Now that doesn't mean that the hierarchy's don't tilt towards self interest and tyranny across time, but that's a bad thing. It's even a bad thing from the conservative perspective so well, so there's room for the left. There's room for the left because the poor will always be with us. That's the reason that there's room for the left and that the dispossessed need a voice not least because there are talented people among the dispossessed and if they're stuck at zero, everyone suffers because we don't have access to their talents. It's bad use of resources, but on the right it's like, no, we need the damn value hierarchies and we need to be grateful for our traditions and our structures because they, they stop us from degenerating into chaos.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Oh, so across the society, numerous hierarchies emerge and at some point decisions are being made about which thing you know, easy being a brilliant flutist or brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning land or controlling energy resources or dominate in financial systems which are the hierarchies that are most important and also the what because it's the way that resources are designated and challenging. Those hierarchies seems to become, well almost impossible. I'm, when I was leaving the hospital, that brilliant hospital, they've been taken care of my mother recently, the window at the level of crisis and trauma and tragedy there. Excellent. They've got the sort of best doctors that guy might in griffith that operated on her bow. He's like a fantastic surgeon. He is in fact him that trump was quoting when he talks about European hospitals with blood spatter flows from knife crime. It was a sort of a mangling of a quote that this might in griffith a given and then sort of like, I step outside, like I'm driving along along white chapel road and there are um, electronic advertising boards and the, uh, you know, that require energy to tell me to eat, you know, sort of Mcdonald's or kit kats or whatever, and there's so much poverty on that street.

Speaker 1:          01:05:39       There always has been in that part of Eastland and terrible poverty and I feel moments. There are moments when I helicopter out to the macro perspective that no individual can long hold or wait, that can't be long born. But in that moment I think, why is this hospital struggling for resources when we can afford to run electronic adverts for Mcdonald's? Who gets to decide how collectively and individually do we determine where resources and where power both in terms of energy but also in terms of human power and up. How were these decisions made? And as you say, among the dispossessed, there is, there are great resources, great talent. One would imagine if the research were possible to the exact same degree. Is there is power and talent and among the possessed, because it's normally an accident of birth that decrease in reading about your early life in Canada in a blue collar community and this sort of the mental health issues and the anger and agitation that grows there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       So much of that is about resources. The dispossession of the native people of that area, the mental health issues. If your friend Chris like that. For me, we are rising through these hierarchies. We that have experiences of both side of that line. Well, we are now challenging this evolutionary force. We are now in a position to talk about these hierarchies, how they're ordered and how they're organized and whether there is room for negotiation. Well, it's up to us to do that because there's a risk in conservatism is saying, well this is how the cards have fallen.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       Of course there is. That is the risk and conservatism, so how do we use confront that? While the risk is the, the, the, the, the hierarchies ossified and turn to stone, and then there's no mobility and and the idea that that things can turn to stone and they become tyrannical is an extraordinarily old idea. For example, in, in the story of Exodus, the story of Moses, so the Egyptian, the Egyptians are portrayed in that story as tyrannical conservatives essentially. Right? And they're masters of stone and Moses is a master of water and water is the thing that dissolves. And so that drama's being played out in these stories that are thousands of years old and in the Egyptian story, the ancient Egyptian story of Osiris and Horus ocirus is the old king who becomes too rigid. And what happens to him is that he's, he's dismembered by evil.

Speaker 3:          01:08:06       That's the consequence. And so even the Egyptians long ago knew that the danger of hierarchies as they become static and corrupt and tyrannical and part of what we do in our ongoing political dialogue and, and, and when it's genuine dialogue is to say, well look, are these, do these systems have it? We need them. They're there not avoidable, but do they, are they functioning properly? Are they loose enough so that people can move? Are they. Are they serving the broader good or have they degenerated into something that's too tyrannical now you know you. You kind of pointed to both of those in the way you formulated that question because you said, look, well, my mum was in the hospital and she needed care and so and I found a surgeon who was an excellent surgeon and so. So what you did there basically was take a bow to the you bowed before the functional hierarchy of the hospital and said, look, the greatest surgeon actually rose to the top and thank God for that because otherwise my mother would be dead.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       It's like, yes, that's our competency hierarchy and it could be contaminated by tyranny. In which case it would be the brother of some powerful person who ended up with the surgical position. Right? And then everyone dies and that does happen in many, many cultures where nepotism or connections define your position on every axis, but then you said, well, but I went out of the hospital and I was driving down the road and I saw what appeared to be a misallocation of resources and what we have to do about that is have have a discussion about it constantly. It's like, are we allocating resources to the appropriate place? Now the, the other lurking problem there is to what degree do we decide about the allocation of resources by voluntary effort, by, by planning, and to what degree do we let the market take care of it. And that's also something that continually requires negotiation. That

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       market mate, we don't trust that. Well, that's the. That's the question is people talk about it like it's a neutral thing, but it's just a conglomeration of interest of the powerful. Well, it's, it's, it's a bunch of things. I mean it's that it can be that, but it can also be the way that we collectively value things. Like, let me give you an example, our collective values, and I'll just quickly say I heard this thing, and in Sweden they a contract regulate and control access to alcohol at a state level, like off licenses or liquor stores. They're sort of socially run and like, and they're not allowed to be advertised in Sweden, Sweden, I guess he's one of those havens of what you might go. I don't know what your views are. Sweden by see a lot of stories about Sweden. They seem a bit like a, Hey, we swayed and comes across as this.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       I guess I sort of this sort of postmodern democracy almost in some respects. Anyhow. Uh, like I, I thought it was curious that they control alcohol in that manner and I am envisaged the sort of breweries and liquor distributors would say, Hey, that's not free market. You're controlling access to people's access to alcohol as if somehow the free market was neutral, but there is no neutral. If the market is what has the power of people's desires will be overly stimulated. People in people like if people are have McDonald's, advertise that they're more alcohol, advertise that them people bloody McDonald's

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       and alcohol. There has to be some more realizing force. There has to be something that's not economically lead. That's not the manifestation of greed that's in the conversation. Someone in a secular society where there is no reasonable or trusted voice of God have to be able to say don't drink too much alcohol or Mcdonald's because people will. Okay, so. So see, I think. I think the most effective solution to that problem is to have the economic system run, let's say by distributed individuals who are themselves aiming at a higher good. So I think the way that you, the most effective way of regulating the market so to speak, is to improve the moral character of the people who make up the market rather than directly regulating the market and not that the market doesn't necessarily need some regulation because you might say, well how about we don't devote alcohol advertising to children under 10?

Speaker 3:          01:12:12       Most people would agree that that's a reasonable perspective. And so that is limitation on market forces and there are places that you can find that, um, that, that limitation being accepted by almost anyone, but, but part of what you're pointing to is that if the only thing that's governing the market is concerned for pure market success, than the market can produce all sorts of excesses. But I think what you want, you want, what you want is to help orient people towards a transcendent good. That's a, Oh, that's over and above market interest. So you might say, well, what interests should you serve as you're trying to be successful as a comedian in while you're trying to make a living as a comedian say you might want to make sure that you're conducting yourself appropriately in the marketplace. You're concerned about yourself, but also your future selves because you have to take.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       And that's partly why addiction is such a catastrophe, right? Because it's great in the short term, but it's not so good in the medium to long run. So you have to take care of yourself and, and your, your iterations through the future. You have to take care of yourself in a way that you're taking care of your family. You have to take care of yourself and your family in a way that you're benefiting the community and that should be foremost in your mind. So then when you start to make economic decisions, even in your business, you're not saying, well, I'm going to do whatever I can to make as much money as I can. You're going to say I'm going to do whatever I can to make as much money as I can while also making sure that I'm taking care of myself and my future self and my family and my community and being like greg grateful for all of that and serving it properly. And then I think the market can work more effectively but still might require some, some discussion around the edges because you know, nothing is simple. So the, the reason that I'm concentrating on the individual and individual development is because I think that's the best way to do that regulation. I think that's important. I think it's non negotiable. I think it's necessary, but I also believe that if you have a society that's predicated on the some of the worst aspects of human

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       behavior and it lost the desire, fear, if last fear and desire are so high in the mix, if you're continually being prompted towards own in Islam and consuming, I think it's the individual improvement will be insufficient. I I feel that your success is, but I don't know it was based on, but I feel like to a degree you've contacted people and oh yeah, I can improve my own life. I can have a bit of personal authority and autonomy and I think that's hugely positive, but if every time you step out of your house every. If every time you interface with society or pick up your phone or look at a screen, the aspect of yourself that's being nurtured, that's being invited to participate on the lower aspects of your nature because those are the most successful routes to a person's decision making impulses and I think that it's difficult to exceed.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       I think it's difficult for these individual projects to to succeed. I think that your know certain people will have that, that message will take hold, but others it won't, so on to some degree we. I feel like I am a big fan of regulation. I understand your irritation about what's being like this sort of a post modern deconstruction analyst argument of that destroy God that has destroyed all categories. Man, woman, none of it's real. I believe in essence, the humors, the deities, the gods. I feel these things are present, but I feel that we're already being subject. We're kind of invisible tyranny, that it's already happening and I don't think it's happening as a result of some critical theory postmarks. It's like, I feel like that that's not where power is, that it feels like it's sort of. It doesn't feel like it's just fucking powerful.

Speaker 1:          01:15:52       Was Glaxo Klein or like, no, it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or like, you know, these. That's what I'm interested is power, real power and how power is functioning and how power is negatively impacting ordinary people. Well, I think it's perfectly reasonable to point out that there might be multiple ways that people experience tyrannical oppression now because every hierarchy is going to tilt towards tyrannical form in its own particular way, and so I've been concerned about what's happening in the university on the radical left and your concern, the concern that you just brought up is something like a overwhelming large scale corporate dominance and I think that's also a reasonable set of concerns. You know, it might not be for the best, for example, that all of our communication is filtered through google. That might be a bit too much. The question is, the question always is what we can do about it, and I think the answer, the answer is an answer to that. Actually. The answer is we can lead people's ability to communicate untrammeled and so that's why I'm an advocate of free speech. We can leave people's ability to communicate untrammeled so that we can have intelligent discussions about those as they emerge

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       and hopefully work towards solutions because we can't just generate a structure rules that says, well, here's the 10 rules that are going to deal without complex situation because things change too rapidly for that. And the reason that freedom of speech as far as I'm concerned is the paramount freedom, the paramount, right. Also the paramount moral obligation is because it's through the, it's through our ability to exchange, to, to, to, um, to exchange honest opinions that we participate in the process that enables us to keep tyranny of the sort that you described and the sort that I described at bay. And so part of the reason that I've taken the tack I have politically is because while my government had the gall to implement compelled speech legislation without noticing what it was that they were interfering with, because you might say, well, well that's, that's pretty much the end of it. How do you keep tyranny at bay? Free? The x? The proper exchange of ideas between free individuals keeps tyranny at bay. That's the best we've got. It doesn't work perfectly and it's also I think a gift that England and in in large part has given to the rest of the world to formalize and codify that to put it into a body of law to erect governmental structures that are really predicated on that idea. It's a remarkable achievement and it's something we should be profoundly grateful for.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       Thank you. I want to talk to you about the taking that accepting praise on the behalf of England. There as an English person accept that there are two dragons. Then there is the inner and the at least until we've reached some non-dualistic utopia where everything is one. There is the inner dragon of our own desires and fears, but I suppose like when we're talking about management of resources, is that a phrase that we came up earlier? Let the where where does the attention need to go and it's difficult like you know me, I suppose there's something about my background that has led me to identify as the Dragon. Oh, is consumerism is turning people into consumers because obviously as an addict that's what I am, a consumer and a truck and Cima and it seems that you, with your background in academia are the, a neo Marxist post because like when I sort of like think about aspects of socialism, egg, you know, people are working to artist only work four hours a day.

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       They should be time for fishing in the afternoon, which I think is in Das capital. He talks about fishing in the afternoon. Yeah. For me that seems like a very beautiful and fair and just idea. Also I don't see them like, yes, I can imagine that they're irritating on a campus. Particularly for somebody who's research such a law. I don't see them as powerful. That's my, that's part of my intrigue. I suppose it's comparable to when I was talking to Sam Harris, another post who I admired, but who am I going? Oh yeah, but I don't like, you know, like when I'm talking to Sam Harris about Islam, but when like where's, how

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       is Islam and gonna be like, I feel like even if he's aware of Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia as an economic entity then on Islamic entity in terms of race, go do some Islam. It's like they go do some business. No, and so I suppose here, well my, when I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned mostly with the emphasis on, on the collective identity rather than the individual identity. Like the process that you just described, I would say, and this is the answer to the question that you posed at the beginning of our conversation is is there something universal about the process that you laid out? And I think there is and I think it's at the core of individual development and I think it's the most powerful of forces and so I think that the individual should be regarded as the proper locus of evaluation. And the problem I have with the postmodern new Marxists types, apart from the fact that their analysis tends to lead to a kind of nihilism, is that because they're making the group the paramount level of analysis, this sort of thing gets ignored.

Speaker 3:          01:21:10       And I what I'm trying to do in my work, we have a program called the self authoring program that kind of steps people through these 12 steps that you just described. The first thing that people do is write about their past all the emotional experiences. The second thing they do is take an inventory of their personality, faults and virtues so that they can rectify the faults and capitalize on the virtues. And the third thing they do is chart a course for the future that takes them into account and others. And so, and I see it as a reflection of this universal process that you just described it. I think it's the most powerful form of transformation, but more importantly, I also think it's the one that risks doing the least harm. Like it hasn't hurt anybody that you've put yourself together. It's just good. Writing is good for you.

Speaker 3:          01:21:57       It's good for the people that know you, there's nothing about it and it's. It's the right level of humility because you took what you knew to be wrong in your experience. You took personal responsibility for it. You made changes for yourself. You didn't go around pointing the finger at what was wrong with the external world and trying to fix it. Now look, it could easily be that once you have your act together or maybe even before you should be doing some things to adjust political systems or sociological systems, but the problem with that is what makes you think you can trust yourself? You know, and it's like, well, I'm compassionate. Like maybe maybe you're also envious of the successful and the probability of that is pretty damn high by the way, and so you better know before you express that compassion, especially in the political domain, whether or not that is contaminated by things about yourself that you haven't contended with.

Speaker 3:          01:22:49       Do you think a declaration or along those lines, I'll specifically that in the political field would be refreshing? Look, I'll tell you one of the. This is a very funny thing, so the ancient, the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia, so this is some of the earliest political we have. By the way. Here's what they used to do to the emperor. Every new year's Day, they would take them outside the walls of the city, so he was responsible for everything within the walls. Outside was chaos on the unknown. They'd take them outside the city. They'd strip him of all his emperor garb, so he's no longer emperor. They'd make them Neil, they'd humiliate him. I think the, if I remember correctly, the priest would hit them with a glove and say, okay, in the last year, how name all the ways that you didn't embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the Mesopotamians.

Speaker 3:          01:23:38       Marduk was the thing that took on the great dragon of chaos, and so it was the. It was the responsibility of the emperor is to kneel down and say, here's all the ways that I haven't been acting out my proper self, and it brought the kingdom into disarray, and then he will be forgiven. They would act out the reconstruction of the cosmos. That was the New Year's celebration and then he'd go in and try to be a good king. I like so. Yeah. Yeah, no kidding. Absolutely. It's like the confession of the emperor is this the way I haven't been good at anything

Speaker 1:          01:24:08       comparable. A the powerful held up to that kind of evaluation in. We don't have rituals for that. Well, I suppose we don't acknowledge the emergence of order from chaos. We don't have a a merge or acknowledge divine principles, so the powerful light, and I think this is possibly because of assumed meritocracy, but people that are in positions of power, they're there for a reason. You don't need to start stripping him naked and take them outside the city and Santa. How often did you rank in that Oval Office everyday get out.

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       Yeah, well, I think there might be something to that and that's the danger of pride that goes along with ascension and a hierarchy. Well, because I'm here in this position, I must deserve it. It's like, yeah, but there should still be something that you're bowing down to and that might be the abstract idea of sovereign authority itself. If you think about it only psychologically, that's a figure that essentially has a, a touch of divinity about it because it's

Speaker 1:          01:25:01       be on a key right now. Harm. So that's the Queen, the anointed and appointed monique, she represents so. But I suppose in a post secular nation she becomes the emblem of Britain, Robin, the emblem of God on right. Well, I think, I think it actually functions to some degree in the same way as well. I do think so because the queen

Speaker 3:          01:25:19       your queen in particular our queen as well because I'm Canadian. Aiden, you know, I mean, I think Elizabeth has been a, uh, an embodiment of moral virtue. I mean, she's done a remarkable job over the last, what is it, 75 years now she's held herself to an incredibly high moral standard and I think she does sit in the background as emblematic of what

Speaker 1:          01:25:40       sovereign authority might look like. Of course you're a postmodernist and this is an area where, because I'm English and I can't get away from the love of the Queen, but I would also say that she is an emblem of authority and of power and wealth and land owners shit, and there is that, there is an order that will be respected and can't be challenged every so often in this country, sort of toys with the idea of republicanism that always

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       grateful when there's a wedding, right. There is this week so that no one has to think, is this right? Are we paying for these bizarre spectacle? Yeah. Well, but it. But it is useful to think about it in a symbolic sense. I mean, one of the things that constantly threatens the United States, I think there should be four branches of government, legislative, judicial, executive, and symbolic. Because the problem in the United States is the president keeps tilting towards king, you know, the Americans like the idea of the first family and the first lady. And it's like, yeah, no, and, and, and kind of tilts towards a dynasty. And you've seen that happen with the bushes and the Clintons and it's not, it's not a good thing, and it might be nice to have someone take the symbolic load off the president and just act that out. And your queen does that very nicely because all of the pomp and circumstance of the state and all the drama and ritual of the sovereign can be played out in that sort of dramatic space.

Speaker 3:          01:26:59       And your legislature and executive branches can go off and do. The administration is interesting that the, uh, the, the, the dentist steeze exert themselves in a sense. It's a demonstration of your argument that there are certain hierarchy systems that find their way into fruition regardless of regulation. But then I suppose there's rational reasons they would have the resources, the experiences that can make the connections. It's easier for them. But that's also the, that's a danger to a republic is the fact that. And it's part of the potential corruption of the state is that while it's easier for the children of those who have authority to have power and you don't want people attaining the pinnacle of achievement because of power, he wants to attending the pinnacle of achievement because of competence. Yeah. Yeah. And those things always struggle. They all. And, and it, it, it takes a society that's very awake to stop the hierarchies from degenerating into hierarchies of power because the generation is the tendency chirp.

Speaker 3:          01:27:54       While it's easy, it's easy. Wba Pam. Yeah. Fearsome and terrifying. Uh, you know, the full cannot pallium well, and people have recognized that it's the proclivity of hierarchies to, towards tyranny, for, for really, for thousands of years, I've seen that as a fundamental danger to proper adaptation. We need hierarchies, yes. But they degenerate into tyranny and they unfairly oppressed. It's like, yes, we have to be on guard against that, but that doesn't mean that we call all hierarchies tyrannies because that's not helpful. Or we call all productive activity service in the, in the service to the oppressive patriarchy because that's seriously not how helpful and we don't dispense with hierarchies because then people don't have anything to do. So. Yes. So I see. I get the beam out your. I say if the individual is tuned, if the individual is I channel that I like a prayer of Saint Francis, I like.

Speaker 3:          01:28:53       It is a multiple. The invites us to find the reverse of a h, a defective characteristic. We all seen that we might be living out to become a channel of some inherent goodness. Well, the thing that's one of the things that's interesting rolled out or two things actually. The first is the word sin means to miss the target. It's an archery term. So that's quite. That's a very interesting way of thinking about it because it means that there is a target, there is a target. That's the thing, but the next thing is, and this comes right out of that, is it's very useful to become aware of your faults because as soon as you pause it a fault, you pause it the opposite by merely saying, well, that's a fault. You're saying implicitly, while there's something that's the opposite of that, so out of your recognition of faults immediately some clarity of virtue develops because you might say, well, this is a fault and I really know it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       It's like, great. You've got some bedrock there. Whatever the opposite of that fault is, you might not know what that is, but whatever the opposite of that fault is is a virtue, and then you might say, well, I have 20 faults. It's like great. The opposite of the personality that has all those 20 faults is the virtuous you, whatever that might happen to be, well, great. Then you've then you've conjured out of the devil. I'm a redeemer. It's something like that. I like that, and then I'm down to play both in terms of cosmology and fleeting morality. There is chaos, there is vastness, but there are also patterns. There are patterns that emerge and whether you call that pattern mail or love or beauty, there are various patterns and I feel that there is something to get in alignment with. There is a tune, there is harmony, there is melody, there is grace would not.

Speaker 3:          01:30:43       And all you're using their musical musical. Um, what would you call analogies, presentations. That's what music expresses is to have all of that in harmony, live music because of that, you know, in those patterns, because music, you think about music, it is the harmonious interaction of patterns and you just described all those positive, uh, what would you call them? Spirits. That's a good way of thinking about it as patterns. While they are patterns. Then you might think that there's a pattern that's composed of all of those patterns. Well, that's what you're after. You're after the pattern that's composed of all those patterns. Yes, absolutely. And you want to put yourself in harmony with that. And that is a real thing. That's a real thing. You can feel that. So it's what keeps you alive essentially when you're trying to become conscious. He, yes, yes. There is something important happening.

Speaker 3:          01:31:31       I feel like what we were saying before about the acknowledgement of difference need an infor inferiority. That is something that is definitely not what we should be actually. Well, this is part of what the radical leftist keeps saying is what we should celebrate diversity. It's like, yes, but what that means first is the admission that people actually differ. You don't have diversity. It's like, I'm glad there are conservatives. I'm glad there are leftists. The conservatives run things. The leftists invent them. It's like good and they're really different. Those people like you know, if you have a group that's all conservatives and they're going down the right path, they're going to go down that path really fast, but if they're going down the wrong path, they're not going to be able to think laterally and figuring out how to get out of it. If you have a group of of left leaning creative types, it's like they're going to come up with 100 ideas, but the probability that they'll organize in a stable hierarchy and implement those effectively is zero.

Speaker 3:          01:32:31       They're going to have to call over the conservatives. It's like, look guys, we finally got a good idea. You can have one idea because you're conservatives run with it and then they can all run with it and so it's really good that we have people who are like that on both sides of the distribution because otherwise the, the creative types and sit around and come up with new ideas until they starve to death in squalor and the are. Well. Exactly. And the Conservatives would just ossify and, and you know, run down a road that got narrower and narrower and narrower and they'd all end up stuck between two cliffs and that'd be the end of it for both of them. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. We require synthesis. This is how does the interplay of opposites. Actual opposites. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They Yin-yang that over the s there needs to be necessarily collusion between distinction, but for that to happen, that needs to be acknowledgement and recognition of difference. But in a, trying to achieve a quality with the annihilation of category is no successful. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. That's not a successful route. Thank you doctor. Professor Jordan, psn. We have good chats. Steinway. That was great. Yeah, that was really good. Hmm. Absolutely. Thanks for inviting me back. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you, Tammy. Thank you.
