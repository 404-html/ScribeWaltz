Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Hi Everybody, I'm here today again with Gregg Hurwitz, an old friend of mine, a former student from Harvard. Um, we've talked before and we've got some exciting things to talk about today. I'll give you some background on Greg. First. Greg is a New York Times number one internationally bestselling author of 20 thrillers, including out of the dark, coming out in 2019 and two award winning thriller novels for Teens. His novels have won numerous literary words, grace, top 10 lists, and have been published in 30 languages. He's written screenplays for or sold spec scripts to many of the major studios, including the book of Henry and written, developed and produced TV for various networks. He's also a New York Times best selling comic book writer, having pen stories for marvel, Wolverine and punisher and DC, Batman and penguin. He's published numerous academic articles on Shakespeare, taught fiction writing and use English department and guest lectured for Ucla and for Harvard in the United States and international. And the course of researching his thrillers, he sneaked onto demolition ranges with navy seals, swam with sharks in the Galapagos, and gone undercover into mind. Controlled cults, her which grew up in the bay area while completing an Mba from Harvard and a masters from Trinity called jocks in Shakespearean tragedy. He wrote his first novel. He was the undergraduate scholar athlete of the year at Harvard for his pole vaulting exploits and played college soccer in England where he was a fellow. So that's greg.

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       Hello everybody. It's quite an intro. I think I'm just going to. You follow me around everywhere that before I enter a room. Dislikes me.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       Yeah, exactly. That's right. That's the sort of intro that makes everyone hopes you're a real son of a bitch after reading an intro like that so they can make it morally dislike you the best thing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       Dislike Jordan, as you know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Yeah. Yeah. So we're not gonna talk too much today about Greg's previous exploits. Instead we're going to talk about some of the work he's been doing in the political realm recently and the reasons for doing that. So Greg, I'm going to let you take that away. Well, so

Speaker 2:          00:02:32       look, I write thrillers and I have. The shorthand that I always give is that about half of my friends were born again, Christian navy seal, snipers and half my friends are gay acw and I taught equally in the red and blue states. My readership is very, very diverse and I think because of that I have a real ear for the buzz words and phrases and ideological shorthand that really shut people up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Um, that just make them stop listening.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       My politics, I'm,

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       I'd say I'm a bit more of a classical liberal and one of the things that I talk a lot about is there certain phrases that we've run up from both sides that just make people completely stopped and it's not dissimilar to what we're trying to do when we're writing. Right? If you write and use buzzwords and catch phrases and cliches, it's less interesting. If you already know what you think of 40 start writing and there's no room for discovery along the way, then you're not. It's not real writing. It's propaganda, right? It's an ramped. You're never going to be surprised by something in the third act. And so there's a real overlap for that. But I found, and so one of the things that I've been trying to do a given how polarized I have found discourse to be and how I found myself moving between vastly different worlds is to try and commit myself to ending or contributing to ending polarizing discourse.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Uh, and so part of that is that I've been focused on trying to rebrand the, the Democratic Party of working with a lot of different candidates and entities in an effort to get away from, from gridlocked and more towards solutions. I have a view that's a lot like Jonathan Heit who you've interviewed it lanes who I think is a great description of the need and necessity for both conservatives and liberals in that, you know, conservatives like walls around things, right? They're like walls around gender. They like walls around countries. Build a wall is sort of a brilliant republican slogan. And the job of, of liberals is to say, hang on a minute, if that wall is to impenetrable, you're not going to have new ideas and people and then we'll stop me to die. And so for me, and you and I've talked before about how it's also the case for inventors and entrepreneurs who kind of create things which tends to be more of a liberal leaning, but if you want them run effectively, often you need conservative managers to come in.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       And so I would want there to be stronger parties on both sides. I mean, I want there to be better discourse. I think if there's a stronger Republican party, it makes the Democratic Party have to raise their game and come up with solutions. And out of the one thing I will say that has been common and everyone who I talked to is nobody's thrilled with the level of political discourse right now. So there's a couple of things there that are really interesting. I mean you talk about the necessity for a high quality representation on both sides of the political, a political, what do you call that continuum. Let's say there are really powerful, temperamental and philosophical reasons for that. So now you mentioned that the liberal types tend to be entrepreneurs and creators and a conservative types tend to be managers and administrators. So that that's pretty well documented in the psychological literature, but you see echoes of that and you, you mentioned the border issue as well because of course to categorize things we have to put boundaries around them, but boundaries can artificially separate and make things stagnant as well.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       So we have to have a continual discussion about exactly where the boundaries should be drawn without ever. Also presuming that we should just do away with boundaries all together because that does away with category. Then with regards to hierarchies, well no know it seems to be the job of the right wing to put forward the proposition that hierarchies are necessary from an organizational perspective. So if a bunch of people decided to go do something of value, let's say it's a collective value as well as individual value, then inevitably when they operate cooperatively and competitively they're going to produce a hierarchy. And the hierarchy is actually a tool to accomplish that task in the social arena. But the problem with that is that hierarchy can become overly rigid and corrupt, and it can dispossessed people, uh, without, without that dispossession being a necessary function of the task that the hierarchy's attempting to perform.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       What's that? It's always both, right? I mean, it's always that we needed to organize and there always are in equities. The result of this, the thing that I have found is that when people lock into political conversations from one side or the other, it becomes all or nothing. And for me, nothing gets accomplished in all or nothing. And so a straw man, you know, Democrats, that all of them just want to tear down the whole system and you know, those are some of the louder voices on twitter isn't helpful anymore than a claim that Republicans have no interest whatsoever in the people who are just disaster. And a lot of what's important is to look at, you know, conservatives who are thoughtful. It's not like they love the fact that people are dispossessed. So the question becomes how do we all help that and how do we actually have a discussion and how do we, how do we get away from the fact that compromise toward solutions is somehow a betrayal that if you compromise anything from the furthest extreme, your sort of portraying your own ideology and your own people?

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Yeah, well I think partly you do that by focusing on specific problems instead of provider radiological solutions. And that's so part of what we're trying to discuss today and to contribute to is that they raise centralization, let's say, of the political parties and also to make a case for the necessity of intelligent discourse. Knowing that people on both sides of the political spectrum have something intelligent to say. So the conservatives have every reason to put forward the proposition that hierarchies are both inevitable and useful, but also to keep firmly in mind that they can become corrupt and that they do tend to dispossess and the liberals have every reason to keep in mind that hierarchies are absolutely necessary in order to get things done, but that the dispossessed need a voice so that the system remains both permeable and fair and it's very necessary for both sides to have some respect for the position of the alternative. The alternative, temperamental type, let's say.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       Well, that's where we have to meet in, in rational enlightenment discourse or else we can't win. You know, talked a lot about the big, the big five personality traits and the ways that it orients differently in politics. So it's like Liberals or higher and empathy, right? In higher and openness. That's why a lot of artists do you find are, um, tend to be liberal, you know, at least the good ones. Like we have bruce springsteen and on the other side it's hard for, for, for president trump to fill up an arena with people who, who are the artists of a certain caliber and you know, it doesn't mean that that higher empathy is better and I think often when liberals are talking, they're trying to push through only apathy and higher empathy and they're trying to educate people in the higher epa well to fix psychological traits.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       And the other thing is, you know, Republicans or conservatives tend to be high on conscientiousness and conscientiousness codes for a bunch of things that are really useful, you know, codes for better health, better finances, more stable marriages and longer lifespan. So one of the things when I'm advising, you know, democrats is like, you can't, if you have to win an argument on the merits, you have to make a better argument. If you're losing people, you can't just go to them and say be more empathetic. That's not an argument, right? It's going to President Clinton and saying, can't you just be an introvert? These are sort of fixed traits. And the other thing is is a lot of conservatives are doing fine over there where they're stable marriages and longer life.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       Well in the empathy issue is interesting as well because it's easy for that to be regarded reflexively as a virtue, but an excess of pity, let's say can be destructive. There's a whole psychoanalytic literature on the negative consequences of of fostering overdependence let's say, and that's a real problem and there is our managerial literature too that suggests that less agreeable managers do better as well as less agreeable people in general having higher incomes because they're better at arguing for themselves. So it is really necessary to give some consideration to the fact that each of these temperaments has it marked advantages and disadvantages and a proper niche where it can function and and other places where it actually constitutes a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       Well, that's where we have to rise above ourselves in me. Like where did we meet? We meet in freedom of speech. There's a reason it's the first amendment. You know, if I was dumb enough to be single issue voter and that would be my single issue because part of it is as, as as a classical liberal, I tend to approach Steve, I have a strong amount of empathy, but I also realize that that's not a trait that I can map on to everybody else in. We're having a discussion that I have to actually meet and make arguments for, for people who, who, who approached the world in different ways and have different kinds of successes to make higher conscientious arguments in a way that appeals more broadly. And I mean that's free marketplace of ideas and we have to meet and figure out and discuss these matters and if we're not doing it in words we're doing with fists tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       The other problem with agreeableness, let's say an empathy, is that the, the, the empathetic identification tends to make the person who's experiencing it feel immediately virtuous because they're on the side of the weaker party, let's say. And there's obviously some utility in that, but it's not really. It doesn't come with a set of solutions to complex problems. You know, it seems to me that agreeableness is a pretty good virtue for small units like the family were egalitarianism. Distribution is of extreme importance, but it doesn't seem to work very well at at higher levels of complexity. So for example, it's conscientiousness predicts workplace proficiency, you know, it's the second best predictor predictor after ICU. Agreeableness is actually somewhat negatively correlated and less and less the domain has to do with direct personal care. And so I don't think agreeable to scales very well, which is why conscientiousness has to enter into the picture

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       and that's very helpful motivator for myself. I look at a problem on my approach tends to be empathy for people who have been left out or have been who don't have the right end of the dominance hierarchy. And for me it's a motivator to look at actual solutions and problems and issues and there's a lot of real concrete things that can be attacked, but if you don't attack them from a perspective that's morally condescending, you can actually get shit done.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Well, it also, it's also very helpful to increase the resolution of the problem. Right? And, and to stop trying to solve every problem with one with one brush stroke, most things are really complicated. So intelligent political discourse should involve decomposing a problem like poverty, which isn't our problem, but a set of a thousand problems into each of those thousand problems and then trying to generate creative solutions to each of them and then to test them. And so the resolution of the, of the discussion has to be increased. And one of the things that you and I have talked about was the possibility that these longer form, the longer form discourse, um, avenues that are available on the new media, like what we're doing right now might enable us to identify and promote politicians who are capable of high resolution discussion, who had the real solutions to real problems instead of having to compress everything into a six second soundbite.

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       Well, the other thing that I'm finding really heartening is a lot of the candidates that I am working with interacting with and at this point that's in the hundreds are very focused on actual solutions. And I'm trying to get a handle on, you know, the cultural conversation, whatever the hell that is, it benefits by blowing the extremes and it feels like that's almost all that we're hearing about. And when I'm dealing with actual candidates, a lot of them are dealing with the anti corruption healthcare jobs and education like are aware of that. That isn't the plan. And so there's this amplifying the facts and then we have a lot of sort of like this cultural conversation about the cultural conversation that things become very kind of narrow and the level of the candidates are operating at the level that people are. You know, I'm, I'm dealing a lot with candidates in different states.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       People are having a hard time right now and they need hardcore solutions and they actually don't give a shit about everyone on twitter and facebook who's preaching. Every Mazda already unfriended them. They need solutions. They need a government that's functional, they need, they want more transparency and microcorruption. There's a very common set of things that govern people, but there's this sort of amplified effect from the extremes of the party that are gathering the the attention and the biggest tool that we have in a democracy in some ways is our attention and where we focus it and if that's being hijacked by know bullshit conversations and Straw men. I mean I would love to engage with, with reasonable, you know, Republicans, a lot of whom are my friends and all my colleagues to say, look, I know we can go and push everything to extremes and find in debate and score points, but like you don't like some of this shit anymore than I do.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       Like what's an actual conversation from our different perspectives, assuming I don't have all the answers that we can come up with certain solutions that's going to take care of people who are not doing as well. You know, who are not doing as well. They're not keeping up with the economy because that's not good for anybody. That's not a game that is iterable across multiple genes in generations. If more and more people are starting to see more and more not good for anybody, even the people at the top, so how do we seek to kind of balance that out for people who don't have their fair shot and during

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       conservative perspective you could say, well, how do we stabilize the hierarchy so the tendency for or the multiple hierarchies for the tendency so that the tendency for people to stack up at the bottom doesn't become so extreme that the entire system starts to shake and tremble,

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       which obviously isn't good for anyone at all. We're seeing a lot of shaking and trembling. I mean, I think a lot of people in the last election did not feel heard or seen or represented in the choices of candidates and a lot of people were like, I don't care what it is. It's not going to be business as usual. Right? So the solution isn't, in my estimation, to denigrate people who chose to vote for president trump. I think the solution is to talk about the fact that we need to do better. If we want to promote a. If the Democrats want to promote a viable alternative, we have to do better with what our messaging is. We have to do better on messages that are anticorruption and we have to make a better argument.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       Yeah. Well the thing is, you know, I was on Bill Maher show a while back and a lot of the panelists on his show really taking pot shots at the trump supporters and, and you know, with the typical sort of pejorative center label that are leveled at them. And I thought that was extremely dangerous because they're basically dissing, let's say he was a terrible cliche about 50 percent of the American population in the same percentage that's been voting Republican for about 20 years. And to just out of hand dismiss your, the people who are voting differently than, than you as somehow primitive or primordial or, or foolish or are ill advised is very, very dangerous. And also more than that, it's also an abdication of responsibility because the Republicans might have won the last election or trump might have won the last election, but certainly the democrats lost the last election. And so I would, if I thought that their discourse would have been a lot more productive if they would have focused on the failings of the Democratic Party, and that's also a lot more useful because if you can figure out why you didn't succeed, even though it very close election, if you can figure out what mistakes you made, then you could rectify it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       That's exactly along the lines of the things that you and I talked about at length, which is personal accountability. It's like you get in a fight with your wife or your husband is the best thing to do to point out the 50 percent or 80 percent or 90 percent where they screwed up or to actually reflect and think about whatever percent it is at whatever number that you can do something better that's actually within your control. And so for me, that's a scalable notion. You know, I have many friends too wide and varied and smart who voted for trump to dismiss them all as idiots. It's, it's a very, you can't denigrate it. And plus we're married to them. That's $50. 40 nine point nine percent of our population, we are married to them and we have to figure out how to talk and to come up with solutions that make sense and that everybody can and so for me, a lot of it is to look at what the impulse was that was underlying that and figure out where Democrats can be better at seeing and hearing people and furthering arguments in ways that feel with legitimate and connect with people and figure out what the messaging is.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       So you always clean up your side of the house first and it doesn't mean that there's. There's a number of policies that I'm highly critical of president trump. That doesn't mean that identity great his followers or the people who voted for him or that I will dismiss any tendencies that they might've had or hesitations that they might've had about voting or otherwise.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       The right message should be something like, I'm not so much white. Your opponent is worse, but by why you're better, why your solutions are better, why? Why, why, why? The grass is greener on your side of the fence. Why there's less corruption occurring under your watch and and also marketing the fact that the solutions that you have are both reasonable and practical. I mean that does require more elevated form of political discourse and it would be really nice if that could be facilitated by these, by these long forms that are available.

Speaker 2:          00:19:41       Hear the refrain all the time of the Democrats don't have a message that president trump is awful, is not a message and I'd been. I'd been really heartened with the conversations that I'm having with candidates right now that there's a huge focus on kitchen table issues. There's a huge focus on trying to tackle health care and education to jobs in ways that are more innovative. When you talk to the actual candidates who I want to start to pull it into more and more conversations. I have an enormous amount of of optimism and the other thing is, is your real money where your mouth is stance against corruption and there is something. There's something called the disclose act that a lot of Democrats are working on which is fully disclosing all of your donors, you know, releasing taxes. I'm taking a pledge against no dark money.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       There's a whole number of different resolutions, you know, I'm fighting voter suppression and that means whether we lose or not, it's not about fighting voter suppression to sort of tell the vote. It's like we need the right to win elections or lose elections fairly, and so there's a lot of positions that are being put forth right now that I feel are really heartening, including a very strong anticorruption stance because you can't. You have to clean up what your site is and in this wave of candidates and I'm looking at, it's been really impressive to me how they're starting to further and articulate what the, what the argument can be from that side and I think that's what we can also start to find common ground to talk about the corruption. I mean there's a lot of republicans who are enthralled with the level of discourse right now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       Well, one of the things that struck me when I've been talking to you lately is we've been talking about what happened with the Democratic Party is also the idea that the radicals, the identity politics types managed to take over the narrative to a large degree, partly because the extremism is more attractive, let's say among a dying mainstream media. It's click, baity and and easy to attract attention to and loud and and cinematic and all of those things, but also that the centrist Democrats seem to have lost faith in their central narrative or perhaps have failed to, to produce one over the last 15 years and that left a void into which the extremist narrative, the oppressor, oppressive oppressor, oppression, narrative, let's say, or or pressure victim narrative has been able to slide in and dominate because of that void. And so that's another thing that needs to be seriously addressed. It's like the center has lost its narrative and, and, and, and that's something I'd like to see the Democrats a deal with now in it, in, in, in the first ad that you generate it. You had a farmer talk, if I remember correctly, you had a farmer talk about success and about what that might mean if you could obtain it individually.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       I think where we have fallen down as Democrats and and where we are now reorienting is, is, is the discussion of aspirational values, meaning is it a rigged game? Like we can absolutely point to things that are disadvantages, you know, but to say it's a rigged game, it's a regained. The thing that we have to say is all that we're in favor of our fair rules at the starting gate and if you work harder, if you're an innovator, if you bust your ass good on you, like go buy a mansion in three cars, you know, go start a second business. We have to be rewarding of success and speaking to people's aspirations and you know, we talk a lot about income inequality and the problem with that is what's the opposite of that? Is income equality. Well, nobody wants that. If you look at the average salaries and incomes of people in the Senate and Congress, they're doing just fine. They don't want that either. And so for me, I think it's much more powerful to talk about income injustice because it means that people have a fair shot at the starting gate and then they can differentiate themselves by their own abilities and their own willingness to work. And for me it's about the starting gate and making sure that we look at things that are there.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       Yeah, well and also that the emphasis that you placed on rewarding actual achievement. We also have to be in a situation where we can admit that at least one of the factors that differentiates people as they move up competence hierarchies. And we have to admit that some of the hierarchies that exist are actually based on competence and not merely on oppression is the amount of effort they into things. And you know, that's become. That's become an anastomotic, a proposition on many university campuses where you're not allowed, in fact, to state that hard work because at some of the people who have made it, have done a, done it as a consequence of working extra hard. Because I guess that undermines the narrative that the whole game is rigged. And the truth of the matter is the game is partly raped, like all games always are, and that is unfortunate, but you can't throw the whole damn game mode because it's partly rigged just unless you think you can put in place a game that isn't going to be rigged. And good luck with that. It's

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       here's very interesting interview between Weinstein and bench purell on the podcast. What's so interesting is there from completely opposite sides of the spectrum. I think it doesn't hurt to find himself as a socialist. Well, he's certainly on the left. Yeah, I mean so, but you have them discussed and it was very, very civil discourse and I think eric can do a much better job than I can of discussing the ways in which the issue isn't that there is a dominance hierarchy and the people differentiate themselves based on their hard work. The issue is sort of what we've seen with the separation of the working class. You know, he, he points to a lot of trends about what's happened with workers' wages. You're a ceo a few seconds ago, made three times the average worker. Now it's a $300. It's not about overall people doing well if there's an increasing exponential separation between, you know, working people and people who are at the top and I think that's the skew that's problematic and the fact of the matter is rather than pushing away and you know, we could talk a little bit also about, you know, conservatives like Ben, but rather than sort of denigrating it, there's a lot of good brains on both sides of the fence and like wouldn't it be absolutely lovely if we have reasonable conversations about what we all want to do about that rather than the physician having to be income equality versus only self reliance and play yourself up by your bootstraps because there's some people who can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:41       There are some fundamental problems with the system, this leading to people having a lot harder time and everyone agrees with that. And if we can talk about the details, you know, it's sort of like when we talk about universal healthcare, I feel like you come in the door and the minute you say it, people are for and against. And for me, there's a lot of other arguments to make. It's like, look, we already have universal healthcare in this country. It's called emergency rooms. It's UNAMERICAN and wrong to let people die on the streets. We don't do that. But if people are uninsured, the hospital passes on the costs of insurance companies who raise our premiums. So the average cost of an emergency room visit in the United States is 1000, $233. The average cost of a vaccination is $19. We're all paying for it anyways. And there's also a lot less risk of public health hazards and other things.

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       If we can figure out a way to come up with a medical system that people are getting the care that they want. Preventive care is infinitely cheaper than trying to play catch up in emergency rooms. And if you don't just walk in the door and say, I'm for universal healthcare, I'm opposed to universal healthcare because a lot of say, look, I was out of work and having a hard time and I had to feed. You are paying my own healthcare. We have to frame it in a way of saying this is good for the robustness of the whole community and I think there's a lot of arguments and discussions are from both sides that we need. We need all those brains pulling together and it's one of the things is I'm watching a lot of new stuff. I would love to see increasingly increasing conversations like the one that Eric and Ben had where their stupid from the opposite side who are engaging very reasonably and seeing each other's points and trying to figure out what skills they can bring from the respective sides of the proverbial aisle.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       So you see, you think you see within the Democratic Party in an attempt at least to increase the resolution of the discussion and to move away from the more polarizing discourse you see that

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       starting to develop. Absolutely. So tell, tell me some of those concrete things you've seen. Well, I mean, you know, I've been meeting with a lot of candidates. I found there there's a candidate who I really liked called Joseph Kopser is running in tax this who's a 20 year in armies ranger, I believe he is a bronze star. He's a graduate of Harvard. Kennedy school is a professor at West Point and what was amazing with him is like he was talking about universal healthcare. He started his own business, a private business that led to tons of jobs and he's just incredible person and he made an argument in a way I haven't ever thought about it. He's talking about healthcare. He was like, look, I have my healthcare from the army for life. That allowed me to take a risk and go out entrepreneurially to start a company that then led to tons and tons of time.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       Yeah. You know, there's evidence in Canada. Our rate of entrepreneurial development in Canada per capita, it's actually slightly higher than it is in the US and analysis has indicated that one of the reasons for that is the provision of universal health care. People can take entrepreneurial risks in Canada without losing their, their fundamental safety net. So you can make a conservative argument for the provision of a certain level of, of underlying security, let's say

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       it was. It was a great argument for me. I mean the other thing is I'm seeing a lot of candidates who are Democrats who were very upfront with their support for the second amendment and it's like, look, the second amendment is an amendment. You can't just get rid of an amendment. And I know that as a classical liberal, when people come after freedom of speech, I get really pissed. Right? And people who were, who were, who were living in different regions in different states that have different cultures. When they hear people start to attack the second amendment or or when it's global, where it's all or nothing. If there is an inherent threat that comes with. And a lot of it for me is to look at and go, look, every amendment has certain limitations on us. Right? So you can't stand up on an airplane and scream that you have a ball.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       You can't threaten the president. United States that you're going to kill him. The first amendment. We have parameters around it. We already have them in place around the second amendment. Everybody knows you can't own a bazooka. Everyone knows you can't own a dirty bomb. So instead of coming in and sort of frightened people in their way of life, if they handguns, if they're hunting, if they are weapons collectors, if we can boil the resolution down to say we're already having every amendment we have or the first and second amendment, we have certain limitations that we've placed on it for the community. So how about if we just talk about violent history checks, let's just talk about that one piece. So 90 percent of Americans are in favor of that in 73 percent of the NRA. And so to have a candidate stand up and say, you know, I love the First Amendment, I fully support the second amendment. Believe me, I've a lot of friends. Your Army Rangers, Green Berets and seals. I know that cultural wealth and rather than having some sort of frontal attack on it to sort of say, well, what's reasonable if you can't yell fire in a crowded theater? How about if we only discussed that and I'm standing with 90 percent of Americans in 73 percent of NRA members? It's a much more respectful conversation and it's a much more solution based. Also a humble, humble or

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       appreciation because it it, it requires a certain amount of appreciation for incremental change, right? You will very ego inflating to do a great thing to make a massive change and much less so to work in the background to make a small change, but small changes are solid and they tend not to produce terrible negative consequences and to and to work incrementally is to work realistically and properly. And I would also say meaningfully and, and that that's another, that's another element that needs to be introduced back into the discourse is like, well, why don't we, you know, the people who established the American American system where incrementalists fundamentally and they knew perfectly well that we had a flawed system that was always going to be flawed in the best we could do is tinker away out incrementally. And that's a really lovely sentiment. I think it's very, it's very mature and wise to understand that what you're working on, it's like a highway.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       It always needs repair. There's always going to be construction on it. There's always going to be blockages on it because it needs to be maintained and updated. But you don't, you don't, you don't scrap the whole thing with every move. And part of the problem with the discourse now too is that every issue becomes code for an ideological position. Like I have a real hard time with, um, all the environmentalist noise that I hear on mainstream media in particular because I always see it as code for a very fundamental anticapitalist ethos. And so I can't separate the wheat from the chaff mean I know because I've read a lot about ecological issues that there are foolish things that people are doing in the world for a variety of reasons. Like overfishing is a real catastrophe. And it was so as deep ocean trolley as far as I'm concerned. But when I read general environmentalist claims, and these include climate change claims, I can't separate it from a fundamental anticapitalist ethos. And so I can't decide, I can never decide whether I can trust the

Speaker 2:          00:32:33       underlined to that man is bad in New Jersey, right? That's not a rallying cry to say, let me pitch original sin to you just to say what are short term effective gains that can be made in additional middle and longterm in business for clean rivers and clean oceans and for fishing industries. Um, and also to talk about the things we've accomplished. I mean, we closed the ozone hole and companies did business. There are actually solutions. Um, you know, we've, we've basically eliminated polio from the face of the earth. There's entrepreneurial and innovative solutions for things that can also be pro business. We've reforested northern hemisphere, you know, there's more forest in the northern hemisphere then there was 100 years ago. So you said this thing about, about incremental change. And that's another thing I've been thinking about a lot, which is when we walk in the door and say, I'm for gun control, or I'm prolife in, in, in every circumstance, or, or, um, you know, to come in with an absolute position.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       I'm one of the things that's really tricky is if you're not willing to have a conversation, if you're not willing to see grounds, there was no terms under which you feel that the, the negotiation or compromise can be satisfied and that gets really dangerous. And it's funny because it's something that I always advocate for when people talk about sort of a broad sweeping systemic problem or justice. The problem is it doesn't boil it down. A level of resolution that you can get traction from all the people that you need because people feel like, well, what's the solution? The solution is to throw everything away positive and negative and change everything. They're not going to do it. And it's a problem. We solve the occupy Wall Street. Um, and you know, it sort of spread from generalized corruption. And incidentally they were targeting sort of the banks and the bigger systems almost more than they were the government who was allowing a lot of it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       But then as it kept rolling in issue after issue after issue, it starts to get very complex. I'm like, well, if we can see it and make changes, are there any terms under which you will be satisfied? And I think that's, uh, that's one of the aspects of coming in on positions of like for Oregon to universal health care for or against the second amendment. There's no ground to be had there because everyone's is digging in their heels and I feel like it's also a bit of a product of a social media and the fact that we've all been sort of infants allies, just sort of these lights and dobutamine hits that keep driving virtue signaling and that goes for both sides. So it goes for both sides. If you can get a real slam or digging on your opponent, the good for you. And meanwhile, in the middle there's a ton of Americans. There's a ton of kids, uh, in education systems that need real solutions. And it doesn't matter how much we're signaling what our beliefs are in our respective balls. It doesn't come down to a real solution. It's also much more difficult to generate real solutions because it means you actually have to have some domain knowledge. And it isn't obvious, for example, that the classic forms of media that politicians have used to interact with the populace have rewarded high resolution knowledge know because it becomes,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       well it's easy for it to get tangled up in the details for that kind of discussion to get tangled up in the details. But these longer form conversations might allow people to unpack some of that in a more intelligent way.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       Well, there's a great discussion between Dave and Ben Shapiro at one point talking about abortion and they're on opposite sides of it. And what was really interesting was it was civil and there was no denigration of the opposing side. Also we're saying, look, I don't have an exact answer of when for me it becomes uncomfortable. Like there is some point that did. It moves from something that is into a point that he's not comfortable with abortion. There's a certain date that that would happen or certain point in trimesters. And so it's, it's. And it's, it's hard. There aren't super clear and easy answers. And you know, ben has a different position. Obviously he's much more conservative on that front, but that's a position. It's weird. I have a lot of friends who were born again, Christians and it's like, that's a physician. You can't just dismiss, like you have to talk about it like that to human position for people who have not belief.

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       I mean, so for me, what it really comes down to when there's sort of different positions on stuff that's really fundamental for people is to say, look, I don't, we, I feel like Democrats have to talk about it. We use it or more humanizing, which is, I don't actually know what I would do in that circumstance if my wife, um, you know, was, was, was, was pregnant or girlfriend, uh, like it's a really hard choice. It's not something that just flippant of like, oh, it's a cluster of cells and it carries no emotional waves. That's, I just don't find that to be true. But for me there's a certain point where it's like, that's ever true for anyone who has an experience like that. Right? And I, I feel right way to approach it the. Well, I think that the answer is like, look, I don't know what I would do.

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       I don't claim to have all the answers morally. The one thing that I believe is I don't want the government coming into your house and into your bedroom and telling your life or you want to do like. That's something I feel like it's so deeply personal and sometimes all you have are shitty choices and choices that aren't good. And the flip side for me is I don't know what the alternative is when we're really talking with specifics. I don't know, a government mandated pregnancy looks like. So if a daughter or a niece who's 18 is pregnant and doesn't want to have a child, I don't know what the solution is to that. Like how does the government then mandate that and oversee that. And so these are conversations that, that, you know, I think are legitimate conversations to be had, but, but from a position of respect rather than, you know, sort of slogans or the fact that the people who are prolife or anti anti women, because there's a lot of women who I know who, who have, you know, deeply held prolife positions, I think it has to be a bit of a conversation for me.

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       I feel like these are really personal choices. I have a strong libertarian reaction to it and I also don't understand what the solution is going to be. If that does become something that somebody doesn't want to have a child, I don't understand how the government mandates that and what that looks like for those nine months. And so, you know, it's not an approach that is dismissive, that's all or nothing. It's an approach of having a conversation about, you know, different values and we have different values and we have to figure out how to, how to talk about them in ways that aren't dehumanizing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       So what do you think, what's a good plan for the next few months? What do you, what are you going to try to do?

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Well, I have a number of plans. I mean, one of them is to keep Democrats focus on nuts and bolts issues. I also really, um, there's a lot of republican voices that I think are really important. I really liked Evan Mcmullin. I really liked where Wilson, there's a number of commentators who would been been really interesting and compelling. I listened to the broad spectrum of everything. I wake up every morning and also read the drudge report and watch Fox News to have an understanding of, of what opposing narratives are so that I can understand the full sort of spectrum and what's bothering people, what is it, and my finger

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       Shapiro's a really good voice as far as I'm concerned because he's as intelligent and articulator of the social conservative position as you could hope for. And so he's a great whetstone against which Democrats could sharpen their knives were taken. If they can confront him in a reasonable argument successfully, then they've already got the argument down. Because.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       And here's the thing with Ben. He's got a great brain. I actually would like it if he was playing less defense and actually we could be engaged the way that eric has to be like, look, what is your, what are your solutions and thoughts on this from. There are some things he said that I deeply disagree with. Like I don't believe that all trans people are mentally ill. He has some physicians, but nothing that I've seen indicates to me that he's someone who can conceivably be reason with. He's also pointed out in places where he believes he's screwed up. He's written a whole articles about reversing his position on things or stuff. He said that was dom and well, that's, that's his words, not mine, but um, you know, it's like the Ralph Waldo Emerson, foolish, foolish consistency is the Hobgoblin of little minds. It's like how many of us have a completely consistent set of ideas and so I feel like with them, and there was that big issue were marked plus came out and sort of said, well why don't we listen to him? And there was a big uproar and then he apologized. And I think that's an interesting thing to discuss because from my perspective, your three views, if you're liberal adventure, one is that he's an alt right mouse, which I don't believe. I don't believe that he's so far. All right. I should say fascists. Nazis.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       Yeah. And that's. We need to define what the hell the alt right is to, you know, the old right is basically a cover story for white supremacy and for an f new nationalist state and to target everybody who's conservative as an outright figure, which is something that's happened to me repeatedly, is absolutely counterproductive because

Speaker 2:          00:41:26       our lectures on your opposition at all, right? I mean it's very easily disprovable. But with Ben, like let's for the sake of argument that got to here, which I don't believe, why would you not want to pay attention or follow him or keep an eye on him or. No, what he's saying, it's not like he's some crack pot, you know, he's someone who's very influential and has a lot of followers. So even if it's the case, which I believe it is, I don't understand how not paying any attention to what's going on with him. It's helpful. Um, you know, I, I gotta say one of the highlights,

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       I think apple and facebook and spotify and so forth just made with Alex Jones, you know, because they think they banned Alex Jones. But that isn't what happened. What happened was they pushed his millions of followers underground. That was a very bad idea

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       and they're making a murder out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       Justifying know he's a little on the paranoid side, let's say is a real conspiracy theorists. And the best, the worst thing you can possibly do to someone who's paranoid is to generate a conspiracy to take them out.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       Well, it is the best thing you can do. When Alex Jones has said virtually nothing that I agree with on any front is to give him as much air time and as much rope as possible

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       or at least allowing access to that in the same way that everyone else has access to it. You know, because a guy, I don't watch Alex Jones, but there are a number of people on the right that I keep an eye on or the farther right because I want to see what they're up to and as soon as that becomes impossible, then you have no idea what those people are up to and how the hell are you supposed to be able to deal with it if you can't figure out what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       Well worked for not watching it. Like I'm a big fan. I like I'm, I'm a big fan of the aspect of the ECLU was the Skokie, which was we show up if Nazis want to march right. And we will protect their right to peacefully march and it's like I have people who I despise. It's like get out there and appoint will be crushed by the free marketplace of ideas I have not believed, but you have to allow for it. And the more that we murder and shut down. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       You don't know how many people were watching Alex Jones to keep an eye on. Right? You know, I don't imagine it was a tremendous number of people, but it wasn't none.

Speaker 2:          00:43:35       Bryce, Bryce will love you and I have talked about this. One of the highlights of my undergraduate years, um, was when the bell curve came out and there was a debate at the Kennedy Center and Dick Herrnstein, who I had as a professor had passed away and Charles Murray was sort of left to defend it against Stephen Jay Gould. And it was a very high level of discourse. And Henry Louis Gates gave the introduction. Things were very, very heated on campus because of their claims about racial differences in Iq. It was a very flashpoint issue. And skip gates gave a spectacular introduction and he said, look, there's a lot of sentiments roiling around this issue and the best possible thing that we can do is to dispute and defend and dismissed the aspects of this that aren't correct here openly and publicly. And there was a big debate. A lot of the student groups stood up and walked out after that, intrigued from, of the amazing intellectual minds, uh, of, of, you know, in the country.

Speaker 2:          00:44:37       And so I just went down and sat in the front row because people that hit it piled out, it's like I wanted to hear the debate, I want to hear the size from, from, from all different arenas. And it was totally, totally captivating, but his point was once someone's a crack pot and they don't have any followers and it's stupid, racist, bellowing things, it's fine to ignore people. There's a certain point where when it's Dick Herrnstein and Charles Murray, there's a point where that needs to be debated publicly and openly. And the fact that the chair of the African American Studies Department was advocating for that to me, I thought was really important and should be heated. That we need these things, these debates to be had and the aspects that are incorrect me to be for a in enlightenment way in a very intense and pollock. And so that's something that I've always sort of held to is I don't, you know, look, I mean there's also part of this about sort of a toughness argument.

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       My grandfather went down during the civil rights movement. He was a Jewish lawyer from Manhattan and went down to the deep south to stick up for, uh, to represent African Americans who've been convicted of crimes against white women. There's one case in particular that was totally ridiculous and he went down and people tried to run his car off a cliff and kill him. And so part of it for me too is like I'm from La Mindset of light, tough liberals who want to, who actually can stand up. We need, we need people to be toughened on all sides of discourse. And I feel like, you know, when people were burning copies of ulysses, I feel like we're supposed to be the ones with the fire hose is putting out the fires were supposed to be the ones who can be really tough and standard ground. And if we can't do that, if we're gonna duck from those fights and that hardening of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, sort of intense positive, I'm really tough version of, of what the points are that we're arguing, then it's not, it's not a legitimate case. We need to be. That's what we need. It's a tough time and we need tough discourse.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       Yeah, well that and that is exactly why you should seek out the most articulate exponents of your have your opponent's position. You know, I just had that experience talking with Sam Harris and we talked for 10 hours and you know there are things we agree about. One of the most fundamental things is that both Sam and I are concerned that our ethical structures, it would be better if our ethical structures were grounded in something that was self evidently solid and so he wants to do that. He wants to ground ethics in the realm of fact and I can. I can understand that it's. It's a perfectly valid desire. I don't believe it's possible in the way that he sees it as possible and we talked about that a lot, but I learned a tremendous amount as a consequence of discussing things with him over a 10 hour period because he pushed me.

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       You need to be pushed, man, because all the kinds of holes and you need to go in understanding that you might not have all the answers

Speaker 1:          00:47:25       well, but you don't have all the answers.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       What I think is interesting is your approach to that is to ground things in an evolutionary model, which I think is a pretty good bedrock, right? I mean that's been your sort of approach to this is to talk about like a sort of archetypal and evolutionary underlay, but Sam's unbelievably articulate and sharp. I mean, I had the pleasure of having dinner with you and him and Douglas Murray in London and it's a vibrant, respectful, sometimes disagreeable mode of conversation that's incredibly fruitful.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       It's also stressful as hell, you know, because you can definitely get put on the spot and have your cherished assumptions undermined as well as look like a fool because you know, some of the time, even if you have an argument, well thought through in that kind of discourse, you don't have it immediately at hand. You forget about it. And then it appear as if you're a fool. And so you put a lot on the line and the discussion like that, but

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       no one's paying attention to any of this for you to. Right. So, so. Well. So one quick thing before we move on with this. So there's a lot of proposals that are there that are floated. Let's say there's an economic idea that somebody has in that wants to be passed on. The first thing that I do with it is I send it to. I have a friend who's a really sharp libertarian. I have a friend who's a hardcore kind of Wall Street Republican and I have another friend who's kind of a big money person. So they represent sort of the different poles of economic policy from the things that some of the policies that might be interesting to me. The first thing they do is send it to all of them and go poke as many holes in this as you possibly can and tell me what all blind spots.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       And that's not only for me to cover all those arguments. It's also for me to be able to learn and see if there's a better approach to it. If it's fundamentally flawed, and then certainly if I'm going to advocate something that's a new policy, I'm not strong on economics. I mean it's probably my weakest spot, but it's the sort of know if we're going to advocate it, what are all the pitfalls were falling into and what are we potentially missing? And I find very few people are taking an approach like this and there's one of the things that I think is exciting. It's funny with the idw has this sort of, um, fear of an alt right overlay, but the majority of guys skew pretty liberal. I mean, if you look at Joe, if you look at Dave's certainly, um, if you look at Eric and Brad, I mean it's got more of a skew, but what's nice is ideas can be parsed in a way where as much as it is embarrassing when you're put on the spot and you're wrong, no one's looking at twists the knife. You know what I mean? Everyone's kind of saying, yeah, I disagree with this. [inaudible] disagree. Have a tie disagreeableness, but it's recycled. Well, it's

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       also based, at least to some degree on trust. You know, if I can assume that you're different than me, temperamentally, but that you're actually striving towards the truth and we can have a discussion and I certainly feel that with Sam. Yes. I believe that. I believe. I believe that he's an honest person and you know, or I believe that he's dishonest as me, let's say, which is more to the point because well maybe an honest person is too high a barrier for anyone to actually achieve given all of our faults, but I don't believe there's any evidence that he's striving with less intensity towards the truth than I am.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       The furthest right in the group is clearly bad. You know, when to get back to that point. It's like there's sort of three approaches is a horrible human and he's a hardcore old writer, in which case if you believe that why from a Sun Tzu perspective, art of war, would you not want to know your enemy and figure it out? Or He's somebody who has views and ideologies. I disagreed with him on a, on a, on a number of fronts, but he's somebody who is it who is interested in the truth and is willing to admit when he has gone too far or not gone too far. That's the wrong phrase. He's willing to admit mistakes that he perceives that he's nate and is also taking new information and it's like I'd love to actually have a discussion with him about something, a discussion, not a debate because he's a world class innovator. He would probably biliterate me but, but an actual meaningful discussion about some of the stuff where I see there to be differences.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       He's, I think he might be in for that. Like you and I have discussed the possibility of finding high resolution intelligent centrist Democrats and getting some of these idw people to interact with them. So, you know, that looks like it's a real possibility and be interesting to see what that would do to the political discourse. And I guess this is a step on that step in that direction. I talked to Bandon, to Dave Rubin and to show our, or to um, to Sam and uh, you know, hypothetically there, there are at least willing to look into this as a possibility and it would be very interesting as well.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       Oh, well, it would also be very interesting to see how this would play out with regards to log form discourse because we need to find politicians. You know, one of the things Joe told me when I was talking to him, Joe, Joe Rogan, when I was talking to him about his three hour interviews, I said, well, does that ever not work out for people? And he says, well yeah, I've had guests on who just run out of steam in about 45 minutes. They don't have anything else to say. And we don't need politicians who run out of steam at 45 minutes. We need people who can engage in intense discussion for three hours without running out of detail, without running out of ideas, a detailed grasp of the political realm. And we need to be able to see that. So we could move away from these six minute CNN interviews and

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       yeah, it's moving away from the tweets and the nonsense, which to my mind is inherently polarizing. It's like, look at what this asshole hardcore lefty get on a college campus or look at this most egregious example of something over here and I'm not saying those things aren't important or that we don't have to pay attention to them, but the vast majority of people in America right now me real nuts and bolts solutions and corruption. Maybe

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       there's a technological rule here, so imagine that this is like we could call this the Peterson principle. Let's say the narrower the bandwidth, the more likely polarized information will be delivered over it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       I think it's great, but I think we should call it the principal.

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       You'll have to come up with a more elegant formulation, but it seems to me that that's highly probable because if you have to compress complex information into a very narrow channel and and broadcast tv would would certainly qualify. And twitter of course even worse is that you have to. You have to radically oversimplify it,

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       right? Because like I said, I a lot of friends, I mean across the gamut of political orientations, I read a lot of news and follow a lot of people across the political orientation all the way left to right or right or very far left, but I'm talking about within a reasonable poles and it's, it's just, it's amazing to me how skewed it is. If you turn on MSNBC and Fox News, we're in two different worlds. If you read the Huffington post and drudge report and so it's very easy to get. Like I think I have more of awareness of what the triggers are for conservatives and what the triggers are for liberals, but also the fact that these triggers are getting this outsize era time constantly. Bio is condensed means of information and I think that's where like the IB dealt with you like there. There's way more listeners to. You guys didn't make any fucking sense like the fact that you had 10, two and a half hour lectures from the psychological underpinnings of the Bible and that more than two people watch. That makes no sense. And so there's a ton of people who are really curious for more in depth analysis is being met elsewhere and I think that's where the polls have been missing. I think that that proverbial proverbial lead a group of people who are, who are being missed and you aren't being discounted.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       Yeah. And

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       you know it's, it's really important that we have the more in depth conversations about it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       So that's our little conspiracy plant, so to speak then is to take this to, to, to inquire if the people who've been loosely grouped together as the idw are willing to engage in serious discourse with to begin with, with centrist Democrats. Doesn't have to be limited to that, but I think that's a nice counter play to.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       For me, it can even be Democrats who aren't centrist or tilting even left of that, who are willing to engage in civil discourse and might even have like different districts and states have different notions and it might really make sense for an aspect of the party of further lab to test something in San Francisco or New York and see what new ideas come out of this. Right? It's just for me, it can't be with moral condescension and it can't be a purity tests, you know, you and I've talked so much about how the left and the right get off track in different ways. The right gets very fascist. You see them coming and it's, it's, you know, fascistic overlay. We know what that is. Historically, it's, we'll go heavily towards voter suppression. There's a lot of issues that are very highly problematic on that side of the fence and when it gets so ethnocentric.

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       Exactly. Or your sense, right? Yep. Yeah. And you know, or, or you know, illegal or hardcore power grounding in a way that's effective, let's say. And with the left, the left, you know, cannibalizes and its purity tests and it goes kind of crazy that way. I think that we are seeing from the Democrats now and awareness that the real solutions need to be offered again. Anticorruption is a huge thing that I'm seeing Democrats start to tackle in a very serious way. Healthcare jobs, education. And it's really important that these things get brought out. And so for me, it's like we can test things that are further or further left and see it work or don't work, but we also need to do that from a position that isn't morally condescending and a position that's also appreciative of different cultures and different places around the country.

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       What's going to work in up in New York isn't going to work in Alabama and liberals are so good at. I think it understanding and appreciating other cultures, you know, like it's one of the things that is sort of a trademark. But it's interesting to me that, that I think we have fallen down on our understanding of different cultures within the United States. And so it's this very interesting divide. But like if it's foreign or perceived as exotic, it's all good. But like we need a better understanding of certain cultures. Also. Um, you know, Alabama, Texas, certainly as guilty of this too. I mean the right treats. Chicago is if it's some like horrible, you know, no man's land. I'm not saying this is a problem, only your belief. But I'm saying we could really benefit with conversations and talking to a lot of candidates in Oklahoma, in Orange County, in Texas who have an understanding of their constituents and what they want to do is help them and to present a reasonable alternative solutions to them about real issues and not the bullshit that everybody is engaging.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       It's absolutely essential. And if we, if we offer all that and lose, then tough luck. We've got to make a better case. We've got to make a better argument. Like we screwed up. We got to try harder and that way. The other thing, Jordan, that's really heartening. I'm seeing a lot of the actual candidates as opposed to the noise, is more and more of an emphasis on personal accountability. You know, it's, it's about helping people and creating new opportunities for them economically, but in a way that empowers them with the freedom to sort of make their life or make their mark if that's a freedom that they can see. It's about sort of trying to level a baseline. Like we talked about how healthcare can be super helpful for business and for entrepreneurial ventures. We talked about why it's essential for the robustness of communities, but it's about setting the terms under which people can be free to make choices and to perform at a level that they want to to build their whole future.

Speaker 2:          00:59:17       So it's not that it's a shift from sort of us running ahead and and blocks for people to us trying to lift the constraint so that people can have better choices for their, for their families, for their kids and their education system for their own work so that they can do better and make their own mark and because a lot of what we're standing on, a lot of the successes that we're standing on as a country are on the shoulders of working men and women. That's a lot of what's accounted for. The things that we've done well and in fact a lot of the world, frankly. A lot of the world is benefited enormously from the working people in United States. You know, in a way that I don't think gets nearly enough recognition. And so we

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       see the, the accruing financial success of the poor around the world. Which is happening at a very rapid rate is in part a consequence of the sacrifice is made either willingly or unwillingly by the American working class over the last 30 years. Absolutely. Working class, that's it. It's competition with the world has been opened up at the level of the working class first and that's been unbelievably beneficial to the rest of the world and probably a pretty good medium to longterm strategy because

Speaker 2:          01:00:27       the American working class, it's like they have been built after the winds for people around the globe, like their heroes. There's no, there's no infantilizing of them in a way that's derogatory and it's like it's our job to make sure that they can have choices for their future, that they. That they are free to compete, at least with the same rules that everybody else competes to differentiate themselves because they've always kicked mentioned. It's an amazing, amazing workforce and they've always done well and it's like if people are complaining about, you know, entitlements, it's like we can also what your corporate subsidies. It's like it's not about one or the other. It's about the same rules that people need to differentiate themselves and it's about creating more freedom for them to reach their accomplishments.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       It seems to me that the Democrats would have a lot more success and and and also be able to generate a counter narrative to the radicals on the left if they made the assumption that there's all sorts of good things about free market capitalism, but crony capitalism is not one of them now and that's part of your emphasis on, let's call it a regulation of corruption, so the free enterprise system works real well except when it gets warped and twisted and so we have to remove the warping and twisting so that people do have the opportunity to compete and to cooperate as freely as possible and that's in everyone's interests, including radical capitalists because to the degree that the system is corrupt and that reflects badly on the system and produces a tremendous amount of opposition towards it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       If you can't win fairly, what are you doing in the game? Like it's to me, it's a very tough argument. That's like if you can't sign a pledge, which, which has been put forth, it's called the disclose act. There's a number of variations of it. It's no dark money, you know, it's a strong stance against interference by hostile actors. It's no voter suppression. It's getting universal healthcare, universal voter registration. There's a lot of stuff of like, let's get everybody out voting, let's lift the suppression and voter intimidation, and then when fair square and it's like, for me it's like I want the right to Wayne fairly and I want the right to lose fairly if we make a better argument than let's do it, but you know, it's also anti gerrymandering which is really good and there's a lot of people who vow to not participate in gerrymandering and to also have it be eager bipartisan committees or judges who determine the boundaries.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       It's really, it's really quite an outrage that it's not bipartisan committees.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       It's ridiculous onto, you know, into a boxing ring and tell, telling someone that we're going to fight them, but they can only step in certain areas that you can go anywhere and they can only hit you with the jab, but you get to use your full battery shots. It's like man up, right step into the arena if you think you can wane and wind fair and square and there's a. there's a big emphasis, I think it's not getting enough press and Democrats cleaning up our side of the aisle in a way that is accountable and that is going to be clear and if there's nobody who disagree with that, I believe if you're a heart, you're a republican and you want to, when you should be aware that you can win fairly and under the same rules and that we can all agree on that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       Yup. Well it would be nice if the Democrats too could help everyone figuring out figuring out what the problems actually are. Because right now mostly what we see in the media is a discussion of pseudo problems. Exactly. And so I'd like to see what, what are the, what are the real challenges that confront us at the moment and what are the proper solutions to those challenges?

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       Yeah. It's so funny because I feel like the, the racial discourse, a discourse around racism has gotten so loaded and so complicated, um, since president trump has is run or has taken office and it's, I feel like all sides of the issue are, there is nowhere you can stop without being a landline. And for me it's really important to boil down to. I went with a program called the five that goes and runs an entrepreneurial program in the prison system and it's absolutely unbelievable how, you know what I call the prison industrial complex works, the privatization of prisons. And you can sidestep all the arguments about who's doing what and who's responsible. African-Americans, if you know who are up for drug charges, the exact same drug charges as whites or 600 percent more likely to get like that. Just straight Scott. That's not well, they're doing more crime. There's no argument to be had about that there. There are certain unbelievable biases of how, you know, African Americans and people of color are put into prison system, which profits from them and which they're doing a lot of work and basically you know, no wages. It's very

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       problematic. Anybody would agree with that across the spectrum. I think if you look at those numbers and it's patently unfair if there's one thing

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       we need to have an intelligent discussion about drug policy that would be a real scary,

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       the prison system and who exude towards and the ways in which it is unfairly implemented and that's a no shit major crawl. And if you, if you discussed the actual hardcore facts and if you could boil it down to those things, no one's going to disagree with that.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       You know what Bjorn Lomborg did. This is really interesting. He's a, he's a scandinavian. You used to be an environmentalist. He still is, but he calls himself the skeptical environmentalist now and I really liked your Lumberg. He wrote a great book called how to spend $50, million and then a few laters years later, 75 billion to make the world a better place. A book, I would highly recommend it. This is what he did and this is really nice procedural, um, achievement. He looked at the UN. I hope I got the story right. It's a while since I, since I read it over, the UN puts out a lot of development goals. Say like, I think they have 150 development goals, something like that. And that's too many goals. You can't do 150 things. And I worked on a UN committee for awhile and we were trying to prioritize the goals because you'd have to prioritize things in order to accomplish them.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       And one of the things we discovered was that you couldn't prioritize the goals because every goal had its constituents and they were outraged if any other goal was prioritized over there. And that was a terrible thing because, well that's the tragedy of the Commons because the goal is couldn't be prioritized and they couldn't be. They couldn't be accomplished essentially. So lumberg figured out a way around this. So his idea was this, okay. So there's a bunch of things that need to be done because there's a bunch of problems out there in the world and but there's too many to simultaneously address. So we have to figure out where we're going to start. So what we're going to do is a cost benefit analysis. So we're going to concentrate on doing as much good for the least amount of money as we can. Now it's going to be our initial strategy because why not right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Because money is a scarce resource and it involves human labor and human intelligence and all of that and so you don't want to waste it. But he didn't believe that he would be capable of doing the prioritization. So what he did was get 10 teams of economists together, some of which were headed by world class economist. People have won Nobel Prize and he had them organized teams and then he had them go through the development goals and prioritize them and make an economic case. And so then you had 10 separate cases and heres the rule. You've got $50, million dollars. You can spend it on whatever you want, but you have to justify it in terms of cost benefit analysis, Naf to choose from this list, and so then he got each economist to generate a list of their priorities. Then he averaged across the lists and came up with a final list of have both problems, which is a big deal, right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       Because the first issue is what are the problems that we need to solve? Like you know, you might think, well, what politicians should be generating his answers. It's like, no, no, no, that's not right. If you're trying to solve a complex problem, instead of the complex problems, the first thing you want to do is formulate the problems property and then you work towards towards defining what the solutions might be. So be really interesting to see if we could have an intelligent political conversation that would concentrate on, on defining what the actual problems are and it's not capitalism versus socialism. That's not a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       That's awesome. Everyone gets to scream at each other and then the superior and get it immersed and getting retweets

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       without having to know anything about anything.

Speaker 2:          01:08:49       Right, and there's no actual motivation towards trying to come up with solutions to the vast majority of people who have, who are dealing with real problems and that's the part that pisses me off is it's like it's this masturbatory venture of discussing the overall culture and you know, if you turn on the news, it's these little sound bites of the most, you know, sort of tabloid nature of the furthest extreme sense versus nuts and bolts discussions of what actually makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       Okay. So what we need to do, let's say generally speaking, is we've got to figure out what the problem started. Like what, what are the, what are the most serious problems that currently confront us as a society. That would be a nice start. Like what are the 15 most most crucial problems that confront us as we move farther into the 21st century? That's a hard. That's a hard question and then I'm a go. No, go ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:09:40       Well, I mean the first thing for me, looking at the system as political corruption and I'm not eating that, it, it, it either party. I mean, I have my opinions about which party does that more but neither one is perfect and the average rating of Congress right now is 15 percent. I'm sorry, 18 percent is the providing of Congress, which is better or works as a slightly about syphilis. It Ain't good and if you don't believe that the people in government are serving your needs and are are instead, you know more interested in furthering the big money donors over the interests of people which has proven time and time again. That's a huge problem with trust is eroded that the people representing you are representing rich donors rather than average Americans didn't seem to your needs. You can't get anywhere. And I think that's part of what's important and all those flags that allowed Democrats are working on. It's not. It's a pledge to say here's what we, here's what we will disclose and here's ways that we will clean up our side of the island. And I think if it's essential, it's essential that you start with your own reflection of fixing the things that you need to fix in order to make a better argument. For me, corruption and governments and top of this year.

Speaker 1:          01:10:48       But go ahead. I was thinking more of a procedurally no, not so much in terms of what the problems might be. I mean, one of the problems I see emerging, well one of them would be this increase in political polarization, which I think is very, very dangerous. I think another potential problem on the horizon is something like as our society becomes more cognitively complex, which is happening very, very rapidly, the of people, the proportion of people who are likely to be dispossessed as a consequence of, um, of, of, of, of lesser ability to deal with that kind of complexity, that problem is going to increase. And that's across the board and it isn't obvious what to do about that. I don't really buy guaranteed basic income solutions in part because I don't think that money is actually the solution to the problem of what to do in life. Like money can stave off,

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       right? In some ways it's the opposite. If you lose a goal that you're striving for, that makes life tough. Over conversation that I think should be around table with Democrats and Conservatives and Republicans to say what's a furrow capitalist argument for how we're going to train people and bring them along. Right? What's, what's uh, what's, uh, you know, a liberal argument for having concern for people who don't have the same advantages from the same background. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Well, you know, the silicon valley types, they tend to skew pretty heavily liberal and that's because they're generally creative and entrepreneurial, but they're very rapidly building a world in which people who are at the lower end of the cognitive distribution are going to be adrift.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       Right. And we need to fix that from both sides. So rather than saying all or nothing, right, like tough lot capitalism, free market, forget it or you know, we need to support every single person in every single way. That has to be the subject of complicated in depth conversations with people weighing in from a variety of different political views. It just has to be in order. It's so complicated. It's so complicated that we need, we need opinions and brains from all sides of the issue. That's for sure. We definitely might also need different test cases,

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       those tough conversations, you know, like between someone who leans very liberal and someone like Ben Shapiro, you can think about those as stress tests, your damn stupid solution, which you've put a lot of effort into elaborating, let's say, can't withstand the stress of a single argument with someone who disagrees with you. What the hell do you. What makes you think that's going to work when you implemented it in the real world? Obviously it's going to fail merely because those people are going to object to it independent of its objective merits and so if it can't fly with your opponents. I mean I'm not talking about the fringe opponents because nothing flies with the fringe except what the fringe beliefs, but

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       also think that the French is overly represented and that's what's so hard. Like when mark duplass apologize for saying people should follow Ben Shapiro, right? There was an apology he put forth. I haven't worked with with with deep loss. I've heard he's a terrific guy and I think that is seen with sort of a furtherance of, of, of an ending of polarization and discourse. I don't know who, who are all those people who were personally deeply wounded by him saying that you should just follow somebody whether you agree with him or not, and I also don't know who the apology is geared towards like who is he apologizing to and if we have sort of a mob ditties I mean the one thing I say a lot and this is a specialist from Hollywood, is there's a huge and widening gap between conversations that people are having in public and what they really believe in the sign of a creeping totalitarianism that's really, really dangerous and it's also from both sides.

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       I'm not just saying that this is a liberal value. I think there's a lot more people who have more complicated views that they don't feel safe to articulate it because fear of complete reputation slammer room, right? Don't we'll be out of work. It will be everything else and so I don't. It's very interesting thing, may have a lot of sympathy for people who set out and say something and then sort of retreat and apologize because I feel like the force of a mod response from the French, even if it's sort of pluralistic ignorance, right? I mean 90 percent of people might agree with you, but if the tanner allowed and it's all that you're seeing everywhere, it has the power to reality. Yep. That's on mind control. Colts function. You know, mind control is one of the first things they do. If they can get you off through complex, there's privacy and everywhere that you look, if there's two versions, they try and split me.

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       I went undercover in a mind control calls to research one of my calls and when you're there, everything that I say that is cult Greg, they're splitting Colt Greg from Greg, Greg and everything that I saved, like wow, this is fun. It's Sorta love bombing. Everyone leans in its direct eye contact, sort of nonsexual touching. Everyone's engaged. But if I say, you know, this is weird, I kind of miss being in contact with someone of their friends. It's the sort of windshield that everyone's, and it's what I think is happening, but from a smaller percentage of people that are really, really loud and if you see it all of a sudden it seems to be the reality would be our sort of apologies that I believe when a lot of people make the apologies, they read flat. To me it doesn't feel heartfelt and also like let's say you really did screw up, like part of what we need to do is screw up.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       Pardon me? Think about things and say things and overstaffed and go, wow, that was kind of his girl. You know? Oh, what's a blanket apology to society versus the individual stuff to say, hey, I forwarded this position. I wish I had articulated it better. I don't always relate myself perfectly. Probably what I should've said rather than, and so sorry to have had a thought that is isn't appropriate and we're seeing this across the board. I think it's really being part of what needs to be done and this is something we already talked about, is to, is to generate better dialogue. Yeah. It isn't like that and hope that the mere fact that it's a much higher quality is sufficient to attract people to it in a way from this other nonsense. Yes. It's hard because as you said, the shorter the span. Like I have people who that, who knows that we're good friends, you know our work is time to tangle up.

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       We mentioned each other and our books. We've known each other shit since I was 20 years old and people will say, well he believes in course minority like dismissed it. It'll be one thing and it's like it's an anthropological term or sociological term with specific meeting takes one google search to sort of prove that it's not that Jordan Peterson is running around like a world war two propaganda poster, like dragging ribbon off into the caves of giving them, giving them to useless men. Right. I mean, but it's so disprovable, but it's also so damning on a format like twitter where you have 280 characters and so it's that. It's that reputation thing where like if you associate with you, you should never be discussed again. If you should follow a bunch of pure, whether you agree with him or not, you'll be bombarded in shamed until you apologize for even saying that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       You'll do that and it's like, look, I've learned the most from my friends who disagree with me the most. I have a wide range of friends. It's so funny, but one of the stories that I tell after president trump was elected. I was in Vegas on a book tour and one of my friends was a crusty old farmer and sniper from the SPEC ops community. He passed away recently, but he was just a great friend and a great guy and I did a lot of shooting with him for the books and then a lot of research and he wanted me to see his ranch and we pull up to his ranch and he has a tank parked in his front yard and sticking out of the. Out of the end of it. He's a trump pence sign. So at that exact moment, my wife sends me a text and it's her and my daughter at like one of the thousand women marches and they just come up on Miley Cyrus, so they're like my daughter's pose.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Even miley Cyrus and the tech sort of comes in and my buddy looks at me. He goes, what's that? And I looked up at him, I said nothing. But then I showed him and we had a good laugh about it in sort of this way that it's like you need people around to have a whole variety of things. And one thing that's interesting with him was around the time of the Muslim ban. And I was talking to him a lot about that. And I, I'm, I'm personally very posts the Muslim ban for instance. But there's, there's a lot of reasons if you talk to people in the military, there's a lot of problems recruiting translators now. Like that has a negative effect that ripple through the intelligence community. It's not good. And you know, and whether I've friends who were vehement advocates of this, but I'm arguing with them saying what is the actual ground truth of how that is affecting things.

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       And then there's all the people in the military who were like, this has been a total shit show. It's really hurting our intelligence efforts and our allies. I feel like that's the level of the discussion. Or one of the other things for me that's very relevant is, you know, I don't know if you know this, but there's 15,000 Muslim physicians from the seven banned Muslim countries in America and they predominantly work in, in rural red state districts. They're providing the majority of, not the majority of the. Providing a ton of medical care to a lot of people in red states. And by the way, those are the people. If they fled Aleppo, they hate Bishar Hassan and extremism like this is, this is, this is exactly the sorts of people who you want to have in these areas. And if they're pulled out, we're going to have a lot of rural areas that more affluent physicians are not going to have access to medical care because more affluent positions or people from America don't always want to go to these regions.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       There's a lot of like bigger recruiting a physician, so you have with people who are, who are great sort of citizens and representatives who hate extremism, who are treating people in different states. And it's like, that's really important. And you pair that with the Intel picture that I think is deeply problematic and you have a sort of argument that isn't just, you should have more empathy for Muslims and which then just deteriorates into, well they're terrorists and like it just devolves rather looking at sort of the temperament of the people who were here and you have to have conversations with people from all sides of the, uh, like I had a lot of conversations with people in the military who support it or against it to kind of start to zero in on what my position is.

Speaker 1:          01:21:08       Okay. So the plan is something like this. So we'll, we've recorded this video. I'm going to post it as a public invitation to the intellectual dark web. I think that's what I'll title it or subtitling idea would be to bring on people democrats at least to begin with because that would sort of run counter to the idw reputation, let's say Democrats who are capable and we're capable of and willing to engage in long form discussions about co complex high resolution issues and to provide a more, at least in part a more centrist alternative to the radical leftists, but also to bring on people with more left leaning views to have them a try their arguments out in a more, in a more fully fledged manner. Something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:21:57       Yeah, I mean how does anyone lives, like if someone's conservative not moving, they should know what the reasonable virgin isn't. The argument they're rejecting like good for you. Then you know all that. They're seeing his reports of like students gone wild on college campuses and the craziness that I believe I believe is a problem. I mean you've certainly, you've dealt with protests and you've dealt with that sort of like brutal groupthink and anti first amendment. You know, like sort of shutting down speech, it's always tricky to talk about freedom of speech and first amendment because it's unclear, always wear that lapses in being legal or constitutional versus just people articulating things loudly, but I have no question that that's a problem, but I think that there's. I think that it is over represented an amplified by the media and by both sides of the media. Yeah. So to see her topic and I think we should get people in who are willing to have conversations that are solutioning here so that if people realize that, see, for me, part of what my interest is in sort of trying to transcend politics and getting to a place where like I don't care if you're republican or Democrat as much. I care if you're offering real solutions. Yes. Right. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       This would be to figure out what the problems are, to see if we can come to some sort of consensus about where are the challenges that confront us really lie.

Speaker 2:          01:23:17       Right. And if there's a Democrat running for office who is very dark money embedded in bold the donors, and there's somebody who's a, a cleaner, a choice, who's running, who's a Republican, it's like, let's have that house, you know, it's, this is, this is about actually spring to figure out solutions for, for, for people in terms of the level of discourse that we can happen to solutions that need to be offered. Because while we're here talking about all this stuff, there's a lot of people's dealing with a lot of real life problems.

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       I've started to introduce you to a number of people. You've met Sam and you met Dave Rubin. Um, you met Douglas Murray. Briefly. Who else? Who else have I introduced you to?

Speaker 2:          01:24:00       Um, a number of other peripheral people or other crews. But I think, you know, I, I, there's a number of people I'd like to talk to the viewpoint and the viewpoint that is more aligned with my politics represented. So we should, we should keep at it. And I think that the aim for me, there's a couple of aims. I mean, the aim is to sort of end polarizing discourse, raise the level of conversation that can be had for actual solutions that we need for actual people and sort of longterm aim for me is just to, to, to eliminate the levels of corruption in the government and that's crossed the boards either side. That's a longterm aim for me is like who's willing to sign onto the disclose act, who's willing to say that they're going to disclose all their donors? Everyone we paid for an APP who's willing to not take pac money is individual candidates. Um, you know, who's willing to stand up against gerrymandering. And that to me is party agnostic. Whose on that?

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       Yup. Okay. Well sounds like a plan. Alright. Alright, I'll start. I'll start the ball rolling on my end. I've got some people that I want you to meet on the Republican end of the distribution as well. Great. I'm happy

Speaker 2:          01:25:18       to meet with anyone who is reasonable and willing to have discourse instead the chest these? Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:25:24       Okay, good. Good talking to you greg.
