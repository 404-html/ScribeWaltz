Speaker 1:          00:00:14       I'm here today in Manhattan talking to Dr Jonathan Heit, who's a professor at Nyu and uh, I'm here for a bunch of reasons. Jonathan is an extremely interesting researcher. I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for literally for decades. He was one of the first people who started to do serious research on disgust, which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to, um, but we also have some other interests in common. Uh, Jonathan also started this institute called the Heterodox Academy, which is attempting to bring back a reasonable diversity of views or what he regards as a reasonable diversity of views to university faculty on campuses and discussion. So, um, I first met Jonathan. It's going to be just about 30 years ago. Twenty five years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       20 14? Yeah. 20 site. The 1994.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       Oh, it was in 1994. Yeah. Yeah, right, right. So yeah, you came to do a job talk at Harvard too for an assistant professorship position and I'd been aware of your work on disgust then and, and agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great significance, which turned out to be exactly the case. So what do you remember about that?

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       I remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard. It was my only interview. I didn't get that job. I had no job for the following year and it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly welcome or wanted. And then I had my session with you in which he was this guy who was had, he actually got a job at Harvard and he was studying young, which is like almost taboo. And he was talking about dreams and creativity and so I just. That was the really bright. That was the bright memory of the day was our hour long conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Yeah. Well I was also really interested at the time, man, now in, in the biological basis of behavior. Right. And so, and, and in the, in the, in the relationship between fundamental motivational systems and thought because obviously our thought is grounded in fundamental motivational systems and your work on disgust, which maybe you can tell the viewers a little bit about, was really interesting to me because it was an emotional system that

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       hadn't been studied much. I mean, you were really one of the pioneers in the psychological study of discuss what other way to explain it is that Paul Ross and my advisor at Penn is the pioneer in this study of disgust and he'd studied it as a food related emotion and he'd written a bit about it being a moral emotion. And I was a graduate student at Penn and I was interested in morality and I was reading the Bible and I was reading, um, uh, anthropological accounts of different countries and different cultures. And at the time morality was all about reasoning about harm rights and justice. So Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading figure in the field and because I was looking at morality cross cultures, uh, and when you look across cultures, it's not just about fairness and harmon rights. It's about menstruation and food taboos and skin lesions and it's very physical and I was, you know, why?

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       Why does so many societies, why is it like the normal default way of being is to somehow bring the body into morality? Why is that? And so I just happened to be at Penn where the world's expert in disgust was and I went to talk to them and that started one of the best collaborations of my life. And what it led to is, is a broadening of the, of the moral domain. Basically there's a sort of a western, a secular approach you see in western philosophers. Either morality is about harm and utilitarianism and it's minimize harm or it's about rights and principles, you know, manual con and a much better way psychologically I think about morality is virtue ethics. It's just a lot of stuff. It's just we have just a lot of stuff that we judge on and this led me eventually to realize that people on the left and people on the right care about different stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       Everybody cares about harm and fairness, but the stuff about keeping boundaries around the group, build a wall, protect the group, hold the group together, hate traders. Um, you know, everybody can do that, but right wing morality builds on these additional additional foundations of these additional motions and foundations so that work on disgust that I was just beginning to talk about them when we first met in 1994 lead eventually to what we now call moral foundations theory and with my, with that five or six colleagues that if you go to your morals.org, uh, you can take our tests, you can learn all about it. Um, but it led to the perspective that ultimately was, I think the right perspective as the cultural war was heating up and as left and right, we're essentially becoming like different countries, different cultures.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       So, so it's not obvious on first consideration why discussed would be a moral emotion. So you know, most of the work that's done that's outside of the disgust realm, I would say is predicated on the assumption that the reason that conservatives in particular, but perhaps people who are more authoritarian and general draw boundaries around their territories because they're afraid of the other, but that isn't really, that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell, because conservatives, for example, are less neurotic than treat in the big five traits sense than liberals, although it's a, it's a minor difference, but the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant. So. So can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Well, conservatives are a little less neurotic, but they also add, if you do very low level perceptual experiments, just like a puff of white noise in the ear. People who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are more likely to vote Republican in this country. So they're there. You know, there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different. But as for why discussed, um, so I'm, I'm a Durkheimian, I would say I love the, uh, the sociologists, Emile Durkheim, and I'm also, I'm a social psychologist, so I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers, but people as members of social groups, people who are totally focused on belonging in their social groups and people who have some pro social motives about keeping the group together, about doing things that are good for the group. So as I tried to argue in my book, the righteous mind, yes, we're selfish.

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       There's no doubt that we often will do things to advance our own self interest at the expense of others. But we're also really groupish, which means we'll do all sorts of things to advance our group at the expense of others. Basically, we're tribal. We evolved as a tribal species and we're doing, we have all this software. I would say, oh, this, all these predispositions, these mental predispositions for life in, in tribes that are battling other tribes. And that's why it comes out so easily. If you look at the way boys organized themselves when they get a fraternity, um, the hazing rituals, when you look at the weights, especially clear in boys the way street gangs organized themselves, girls, tribalism is a little different. Um, but I would say this, and that's why, again, I love the [inaudible] and approach of archetypes or something. There's just this weird stuff that is pan human, even if it comes out slightly differently around the world, there really is a human nature and it comes complete with a whole bunch of like, predesigned idea.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       So there was a new article, I think it was published in nature. I'll try to find the link for it is about a year old, um, that, that was based on high resolution imaging of neuronal connections. It's actually reviewed and Kurt Selles Kurzweil's book, how to build a mind. I think that's the name of it. Um, and so it turns out that the Cortex is made out of these columnar structures that are pre-organized units of neurons and they're replicated across the entire cortex. Basically the same structure. And like the, the, the older, let's say connectionist idea was that neurons that fire together wire together, right? That that's happened. And of course that's pretty standard neurology, but the columns are already prewired. So it's actually columns that fire together, wire together, but there's, but there's even more with the high resolution scanning. So it turns out that underneath the columnar structure, there are these prebuilt highways that are connected, connective tissue that are pre, pre prepared.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       So the columns have the option to connect to the, to the underlying highway, and that highway can connect other columns. So it's as if in implicit in the brain organization, and this is at the cortical level, say nothing of subcortical organization, there's already preexistent, uh, uh, likelihoods that certain neurons will fire wire together. Yeah. So, and, and what else is cool is that this is actually architecturally quite a regular. So they found that the, these superhighways arranged in lines and, and, and, and in, at right angles to one another. So it's almost like a three dimensional structure of why your cubes that underlies the neuronal structure. So that's a neurological evidence for the architects.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       Cool idea. Let me just explain to explain to the viewers here why this isn't just some like psychological geek conversation. This is actually really relevant to a lot of the things that we'll be talking about that your audience product cares about because one of the most contested ideas and the social sciences is the idea of uniqueness and the idea is what if something has a need, then it can't. It can't vary across societies and if it varies across societies then it's not an eight and if gender varies, if masculinity or femininity vary across society is not innate, it's socially constructed, but that's the wrong understanding of maintenance. The definition that I use comes from Gary. Marcus was actually neuroscientist here at Nyu. He says innate doesn't mean hardwired. There's almost nothing interesting that's hardwired. Innate means structured in advance of experience, but that experience can still revise it and boy does that work for gender, for almost everything, for almost everything that we're not a blank slate about anything. And something I used to tell my students at Uva I taught at Uva for 16 years is, you know, everything's a social construction, masculinity, femininity, cancer, the sun, death, everything. There's a social construction for you won't find a society that doesn't have thoughts about these things, but the fact that societies have social constructions tells us nothing about whether there's not also an underlying biological reality and in almost all cases there.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       Well otherwise we wouldn't be able to communicate, which is one of Eo Wilson's comments right? When Wilson, this, the entomologist who studied dance at Harvard and also wrote a number of books about sociobiology that got him in trouble with the radical leftists. And he said even if we could communicate with ants, there'd be nothing to say to each other because they're fundamental mode of being in the world is based on motivations and interests that are so different from ours. That there wouldn't be any structure for communication. And you can kind of tell that with regards to the animals that we make friends with, right? We're much more likely to make friends with animals who has a who have a fundamental biological and social nature that's very close to ours like dogs because we can basically speak their language even though not completely

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       a mammo language of love and you know, I miss you and I want to play with you. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly. And that bonding. Okay, so back to discuss, back to discuss. So I'm. So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rosin is to see us as these amazing omnivores. This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other apes. We are just brilliant omnivores and we have the Omnivore's dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff. We're not tied to one place. We can roam onto a whole new continent. So we were interested in stuff, but stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes. We have to be careful about that. And so these motives have to be intention and this is actually an interesting way to understand the left, right? Difference. You have to have both motives, but if so, imagine two siblings, one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff, seeking out new stuff, and the other is a little more fearful.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       And we're like, Whoa, no, let's, you know, let's not try that. That stayed with what's tried and true. I mean, that's progressivism and conservatives and that's the origins of it. And if you look at kids' behavior at the age of two or three, it does predict how they'll vote much later. Not Hugely, but there is a clear prediction there. So, um, so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sorta out there and, you know, we, we, we seek out variety and diversity. We think diversity is just a great thing or whether we want a little more order structure, predictability. Conservatives are neater than a progressive's if you take photos of their rooms, um, um, you know, you can actually cleanliness and organization, you can predict how they vote, um, discussed. It turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over, especially in this country, our culture war is over, you know, going back in a few decades, you know, sex, drugs, the flag, immigration, all of these things.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Um, I had to study with my colleagues. It was led by Seneca Leyva in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people and we also had their scores and the discus scale, but one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity. And it relates to discuss. What we found is that if, you know, if you know, um, uh, what people's left, right? We're, how they place themselves in the left rightscale you can pretty much predict where they fall on most culture war attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity, purity. So what I mean, his flag burning. Okay. Do you think, you know, do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or the country's flag as an expression, as a political action? What do you think people can give some answer on a one to seven scale and people on the right thing, you know, more like this.

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       Ain't no people in the left. Yes. People who score high on loyalty are more likely to say no. People who low lower and say yes, and that's even taking account of where they are on the left, right dimension. But here's the cool thing, um, it's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing that you can really understand what people are doing because some people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth. They see it as having some innate essence, some something sacred about it which must be protected. And so, um, so this is true. Even they think of it as a unifying center. Exactly. That's right. So if there's something sacred, and this is the, this is the central piece of my work around politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity. If you hold something sacred, then your team's circles around it. And it's only those who circle around with you and sometimes literally circled around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca. They literally circle the Kebab circling is a very primitive, ancient. It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time that binds you together,

Speaker 3:          00:14:58       children do that with their mothers when they, when they engage in exploratory behavior, right where all they used their mother as a center of the world and children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mother. So they move out until they, they, they trip over their, their uncertainty threshold. Neat. And is it a distance, like it's a district? Yeah. Yeah. And so, so the more exploratory kids who are lower negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother. So the mother is the center and you know that that would be associated symbolically with the idea of the center as a motherland or potentially as a father like that. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       That makes sense. So this way that we're, we're incredibly symbolic creatures. We're not just out to make as much money as we can. Where's this symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really important, not just on the right. It's always been important for especially religious conservatives were beginning to see it even on the campus left, and this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space. One of the things that really alarms me about what's happening on campus last couple of years is that the older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas. It's A. It's a zone of enormous choice. People can take what courses they want, say what they want. It's kind of a wonderful free for all with some with norms of respect. It's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the boundaries and within its they're almost. They're blasphemy laws basically, and I really started noticing this. When you look at the videos of the Middlebury, a protest when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and as, as everybody knows, he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison and it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying they're sacred in a racist, sexist, antigay. Charles Murray go away. It's like a ritual incantation. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       so that all the space is safe and it's safe and

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       not yet. So far all of this happening is they're binding together. They're moving and you know, synchronous movement and call and response. So it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship. But here's the cool thing, when the administrator, I forget who it is, comes on to say, okay, we have moved, we're moving the talk. And then you hear a couple people screaming out off campus off campus and he says to another location on campus and there's like, oh no, no, because you know, no one had to go to this talk. So everyone could have just stayed home and the students did succeed in shutting down the venues so they could have declared victory. But it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus. We can't have him speaking on because that defiles

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       us, that pollutes us. We must shut that down. And that's where I started saying, wow, this is like full blown psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity, blast for me. Uh, and that I think, you know, that that doesn't describe most students that, that describes this sort of the core, those who who really have their identity is wrapped up in this movement. Okay. So, so we discussed, I wanted to, I wanted to ask you a couple of things about that. So, you know, the big five research into political differences basically shows that the liberals are high in trait, openness and low in trait conscientiousness and the conservatives or the reverse, but we fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with the big five aspects. Scale and orderliness is strongly associated with disgust. So. So it sounds like Freud. Yeah, right, right, exactly. It does sound a lot like Freud but it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       But it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces, for example. So, so now and they're meeting start on time. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Right. Right. So. So then the, the, the nexus for political belief seems to be openness so that that exploratory tendency that you talked about exploration of ideas and creativity and low orderliness and so then I thought, well why in the world would, why would the political nexus go across those dimensions, which are some relatively uncorrelated than I thought, and this is in keeping with your work on discussed is that it's an issue of borders, which of course seems more or less self evident in the wake of trump's election when he talked about borders, but you might say, and I think this is reasonable, that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between categories to remain intact no matter what level of analysis.

Speaker 3:          00:19:37       So it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of, of, of rooms, towns, states, countries, all of that. So the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that. Now there was a paper published in Plos one. I don't know if you saw it. It was a couple of years ago, it was a mind boggling paper, it should have been front page news as far as I was concerned and what the researchers did was between countries and then within provinces or states within countries, they correlated the level of, um, of frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and found a walloping correlation. It was like point six. It was one of the highest by the, for, for, for those of you who don't know, social scientists never discover anything that's associated with anything else at a correlation of point six other than heritability.

Speaker 3:          00:20:29       Right? Other than heritability. Yes. And so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease, the higher the probability of, of totalitarian authoritarian political attitudes, and then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was, was this pop down authoritarianism or bottom authoritarianism? And the answer was that it was bottom up. Okay. And so I thought about that in two from two perspectives simultaneously at the time. Okay. So we identified disgust, sensitivity with orderliness, so say a fundamental sub trait. Then I was reading this book that was called Hitler's table talk, and it was a, it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to 1942. Yeah. So it's a spontaneous utterance, say and um, it's full of discussions about Jews and Gypsies and older people he tormented. But what's really interesting is all the language is discussed.

Speaker 3:          00:21:27       It's not fear. So, so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the Aryan race and country was a pure body and then it was assaulted by parasites. Right? And then I remembered what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans showed up and shook hands. What happened was that 95 percent of them are dead within 50 years, right? Because of smallpox and measles. And so that, that border issue that separates conservatives from liberals, let's say, is the conservative say the novel is potentially contaminated. It's not so much that it's dangerous. That's different. That's fear. It's contaminated. And the Liberals say, hold on a minute. If you make the borders too thick, then information can't pass through. Exactly. So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right there. Right, right. And, and then since we have a biological architecture on which are cognitive platforms are erected, we have the same attitude towards abstract information, which would be ideas that we do to things like food or, or illness. Right? Right. And so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or contaminated.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       And that's right now I'm a big fan of George lakoff metaphors. We live by a that we, yeah, we use our bodily or bodily Schema data to think about abstract things like politics and like what our policies should be about borders and immigration. Uh, there's a Canadian psychologist, mark shaller. He and his colleagues have developed what they call an account over these, the behavioral immune system, right? That we don't just try to, you know, microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors then did lions and tigers and bears and so whoever can keep themselves and their children from being exposed to fatal illnesses, winds the evolutionary game. And so a lot of that is judging carefully about people. Is he dangerous, dangerous. And that's both for sexuality, for contact, for all kinds of association. Um, so yeah, and a lot of ways our emotions and our bodily interactions structure, how we think and feel about about social.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       Well even with the black death in Europe, I mean, so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around the world and they brought back rats that were infected. Exactly. So, so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time. So the European expansion produced a tremendous interchange of ideas from all around the world. That's globalization, but it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the population at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       So wouldn't it be good if in every society, every organization. And we had some people who specialized in, uh, a specialized in saying, hey, what are the opportunities? And then we had other people who specialize in saying, well, but what are the risks? And it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in themselves. When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different personalities and different motives and goals, we actually can get better at.

Speaker 3:          00:24:10       We can have a discussion between them. Yeah, well that's exactly why that is for that precise reason that, that I've been so interested in free speech as a, as a, as a value because or even on the economic front, it's pretty obvious if you look at things economically that the entrepreneur types who start businesses are lumped in with the liberal creative types. We've done a lot of work on the prediction of entrepreneurial behavior on the ability and his openness. That's the big predictor. It's not the only one. It's openness and ICU fundamentally, but for managerial and administrative expertise, it's, oh, it's Iq and conscientiousness. So the liberal start businesses, but they can't run them because they're there. Their interests flipped and they don't have the organizational ability and the conservatives can run them, but they can't continue to transform and expand them.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Yeah. 10 and Yang. Yin and Yang. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:25:00       So, so one more thing about what happened in Nazi Germany that that's very relevant and interesting because it's, it's useful to get these motives right. You know, first of all, if, if something disgusts you, if something, if you're afraid of something then you run away from it or you free, but if something disgusts you, you try to burn it or dig or kill it. Right. You try to get rid of or expel it. That's, that's right though. You want to get it away and destroy it. So when Hitler came to power, he putting a bunch of public health schemes, like a, he had vans that went around and screen people for tuberculosis and then he went on a factory, cleanliness, a campaign. So the factories were supposed to be tidy it up and he, he washed, he made about four times a day by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:25:45       It's also a great worship or of willpower, which is associated with orderliness and seems maybe to be associated with disgust sensitivity in some way that isn't yet understood. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I don't, I don't understand that connection either. So they, he convinced factory owners in Germany to get rid of the rats and the mice and the mice and the and the insects in the factories and also to clean them up and beautify them. But the gas they use to clean up the factories was like lawn a and it was the variation of that gas cycle on b that was then used in. Yeah. So you could see this ramping up based. So it was. Yeah, absolutely. So it was public health, then it was social cleanliness, then he went into the asylums and cleaned them up and so it was just this expansion of who was contaminated and who was impure. And I think also his fascination with fire and his use of fire symbolism was also associated with that. Would that appeal to purification? Because the whole idea of purification by fire

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       is a very ancient idea. So. Okay. So, so how did your work on discuss change the way that you looked at things fundamentally mean you gave some indication of that already, but what else has changed? Um, so since I was coming out of a, of a psychological literature that was very focused on, on sort of secular, secular ethics about justice and fairness, and then I began studying disgust and looking at the broader moral domain. They're almost all societies have. That then also led me to think about, well, okay, if disgust is a reaction to things that seem to be degrading. So an interesting element of discusses this notion of degradation that there are always these vertical metaphors. I'm a image discuss, brings us down and discussed. So a lot of some religious practice in Judaism and Islam and Hinduism is about preparing your body to approach God and uh, purification.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       And so that led me to think, well, if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower base or animal biological nature, is there an opposite? Emotion is an emotion of that. We feel when we see some manifestation of a higher nobler nature. And I was just beginning to think this one. I moved to Uva. I got my first job at University of Virginia in 1995 and I read a stat of Thomas Jefferson's letters. And in one letter he describes, he describes the feelings you get from reading great fiction, he advises a cousin of his that he should buy fiction for his library, not just serious works of law and philosophy. And he described, he says, doesn't, he describes the feeling of, of, uh, of uh, having your sentence be elevated, does it not dilate your breast or give you an open feeling in your chest when you see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude?

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       I thought, wow, that's exactly it. Um, and so because I've been studying disgust, I then started studying its opposite which I and some others called moral elevation. So this is kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation and snaps onto the body to, with regards to. That's right. High low, a clean, dirty in. Yeah, it's a beautiful pairing. And so having this language of elevation and discussed just really has helped me see a lot of things. I just, I just see a lot of things happening. It allows me to like even, you know, manipulate like have been applying for a grant proposal. Like I can get very good at like having an elevating ending, you know, to, um, uh, to end with a note of uplift. And so it just brought, it just broadened my thinking about morality. And this was around 1995. And so again, it just prepared me is that I'm a and I'd already been to India by that point.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       I spent three months doing research in a Rissa in eastern India. Um, so it just broadened my thinking and that's what allowed me finally to understand conservatives because I had always been on the left. I hated Ronald Reagan. Um, I thought Republicans were stupid and evil and it was only when I had gone to India and really tried to understand a traditional religious hierarchical gender stratified society. Tried to understand it in their terms. They didn't try to just bring in my own, my own western left, you know, left leaning perspectives, um, that I was. And this was all under the guidance of Richard Schwayder, my postdoc supervisor at the University of Chicago where did a postdoc. It was only then that I was able to sort of get inside their minds and their moral system and see that there were alternative moral worlds. They each had their own logic and that was the metaphor I came to it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:14       You know, the time, you know, the matrix movies were very popular. So the metaphor, the Matrix as a consensual hallucination made a lot of sense. It's where I can up with the idea of just speaking about moral matrices, whichever different matrices that are grounded in biology, biology in the sense that it gives us the potential. It's like the building blocks of this matrix can't be just anything that comes, it comes from our experiences are embodied experiences and again, George Lakoff is the, is the master of, of, of that thinking. And so it was only then that I was able to now listen to conservative talk radio and Christian religious radio and see, rather than just saying, oh, that was stupid terrible. People say like, Oh wow. Yeah, I can see that they're striving for certain version. Right. So you started to understand their metaphorical language essentially. That's right. And that was like kind of like my, you know, I know a great awakening or scales falling from my eyes, but you know, since. But it took a few more. It took a number of, a lot more years. But eventually I kind of just pulled out the implants from my eyes and I stopped seeing everything through a partisan lens and I'm not on any side now. I'm just trying to understand what the hell is.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       Well, it's really useful. It's really useful to understand that there are actual reasons why people see the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right and the other is wrong because the liberals are correct when it comes to borders. That if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow, you risk making the society so static that any radical environmental transformation will sink it. It's the case, but the conservatives are right in that you pay a big price with regards to newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to contaminating while to contamination period, but also to contaminating ideas. And so then I've always thought, you know, the environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense, and what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its back and the only way we can do that is by people, by having people pull to the right and say, be careful. And people pulled to the left and say, well, yeah, but be open with that dialogue and the, the exchange of information that, that dialogue allows. We can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay well and stay on the back, let's say. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       okay. So that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake, but I think it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus. And two, why viewpoint diversity is so important because that's, I agree exactly with what you just said. And so what I, the view that I've come to in studying moral psychology is that we have, is that humans are ultra social apes. Um, we, we evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other. Uh, we evolved to have these low level animistic religions. That's our steady state, that's the way we were for at least 100,000 years, are much more closer to a million in some form. Um, so that's sort of our design. That's what we're designed for in a sense. Um, and in that sense where as individuals really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning, um, but if you put us together in the right way with the right checks, with the right, the right systems, um, the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it, which is true of the brain, to the brain is composed of neurons.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       Each neuron is kind of stupid little switch, but you put them together in the right way and you get something really brilliant and at the same way, um, I don't know all the history here, but my understanding is that science begins or the culture of science, the scientific revolution begins in Europe in the 17th century. As you begin getting, you get the printing press so people can share their ideas, but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas. And that's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best. We're really bad at this confirming our own ideas. It's very hard to make it very hard to do that. But you put your ideas out there and then everyone else is motivated to challenge them. And so if you put us together in the right way, the truth comes out.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       And so adversarial systems of law journalists know this. They have to listen to both sides. Scientists know this. Social scientists should know this. Okay? What happened? Well, I'm, the academy has, has always leaned left in the 20th century, but leaning isn't a problem. So people think, oh, viewpoint diversity we need, we need everybody. We need Nazis. We need every, the, no, we don't need everybody. What we need is no orthodoxy. That's what's fatal orthodoxy. So if you have a, if you have to feel it, like sociology or social psychology in which it's two or three to one left to right, that's totally fine with me. That's totally fine. Uh, because if someone makes some claim that's just like ideologically blind, someone will say, uh, you know, common sense, other evidence that you've missed and then the system works. But what I learned when I started down this road in 2011, I gave a talk at the big conference with social psychologists.

Speaker 2:          00:35:07       I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity, that I could only find one conservative in the entire field and I gave a talk on this. Um, and um, um, and so what I've learned since then is that the ratio in psychology was between two to one in Florida. One left, right? All the way up to the early nineties. We've gathered together all the studies we could find. So all the up to the early nineties, it's only three or four to one left to right, which would be okay, but between 1995 or four and 2010, it goes to a 14 to one. Do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes. So, um, so you get the same story whether you look at Republican, Democrat ratios or liberal conservative there, they tell the same story. So the, two of the big things going on there are one is that the greatest generation which had a lot of Republicans, um, so a lot of men go off to World War Two, they on there, on the Gi bill, they entered the academy in the 19 fifties.

Speaker 2:          00:36:08       A lot of them are conservative or Republican and so you have a lot of them, but in the sixties and seventies, one of the main reasons to go to Grad school and the social sciences is either a, to stay in school to escape the Vietnam war draft or be to fight for social justice and against racism. So in sociology and psychology in particular in political science, maybe, I'm not sure, you get a huge influx of left leaning people who are there to pursue social justice. So you know, the motives are fine and if it was balanced to be totally fine, but as you get these young junior people on the left come in in the seventies and eighties and then you get the older people that are more politically bounced, retiring of the eighties and nineties by the time you get to the late nineties, it's all baby boomers.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       And so do you get a, you get a positive feedback loop developing their, like you said, it's like three to one. It's okay, but maybe when it hits four to one, it goes to like 20 to one, then you stay. Exactly. So then, so then you start getting hostile climate. So I wrote a review paper on this with a, with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and lead Justin Jarrett, Crawford. Um, um, and um, and we, uh, we reviewed everything that we could find and we concluded that most of what's going on is self selection. That is people on the left are more open to experience. They're always going to get self selection. But then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate. I mean, it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a Grad program, there's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong.

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       And look in the academy, we're all about saying, Hey, if there are subtle hints here and there, you can't succeed, right? I mean, that's what we do for a living is we say that little things will stop people. Um, well, little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically. Uh, and so you do get hostile climate. You do get over discrimination. There's evidence of that. And then there is also, it is part of the story here that what it means to be a conservative in the nineties and especially to thousands has changed. So it is true that you know, that, that the, the conservative, we're not in any way anti science, um, until much more recent times. Now actually all sides are anti science fact, different sciences. But I'm in America, they're the right wing. The Republican Party has, it's controversial, but I do believe that the polarization starts with the right moving further out. So what it means to be conservative to the anti anti evolutionary, which is actually what's happening on the left now to exactly. That's so as this modern like talked to

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Brent Weinstein the other day and you know, he, he, one of his claims is that evolutionary biology has something in it to offend everyone. So it's a, it's a science that's very likely to be targeted by extremist. You also brought up something that actually touches on the ICT on the difficult problem of how it is that you might define someone whose ideologically possessed, let's say, or ideologically rigid because the idea was that you can make a valid case for the utility of free information flow and, and the free flow of people that would go along with that and you could make a good case for the danger of that. And so the idea might be that if you're only making a case for the danger of that, then you're tilted too far to the right. And if you're only making a case for the utility of that, then you're tilted too far to the left.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       Exactly. That's right. And so we can look at immigration as a nice example. There was a recent essay in the Atlantic, I think it was by Peter Beinart where he, um, he reviews, he had started with a lot of quotes that are pretty nuanced positions about immigration from Barack Obama, Paul Krugman and a bunch of other people on the left who used to be able to say, on the one hand, you know, compassion, economic, on the other hand, you know, we have to have a legal process and there's a threat to low wage workers. So people on the left, you still have to talk about immigration and talk about the pros and cons, the pluses and minuses. But beinart shows how in the last four or five years you can't, if you so much as suggest that will, maybe immigration is a net good, but it might have some deleterious effects on certain classes of, of low wage American workers.

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       You could get in big trouble, right? Because that's instantly prejudicial because immigration has become a sacred topic. So this is the key thing that I want everyone to keep in mind. We are fundamentally religious creatures. Were built for religion and it's a great achievement to create a scientific establishment and an academic establishment that keeps that way of thinking out. Scientific thinking is not natural thinking. Religious thinking is natural thinking and what's happening to us in the last few years especially is a flooding in of religious thinking, and so let's get a bunch of social scientists talk about immigration. What are they going to do? Look at the data, way up. The pluses and minuses. No, they're going to. Many of them feel they're on a team and that team is fighting the right. The right is anti-immigrant. It includes racist elements, therefore that justifies us in being pro. Immigration and social sciences are always. There's always ambiguity. There's always conflicting studies, multiple causal factors. Is that always in the social science study? That's right. So buying art's point was that the left used to be able to think straight about immigration. Clearly it had a generally pro immigration, but it used to be able to think straight, but in the last few years a religious orthodox mindset has overtaken it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       Okay. So we might as well also pointed out that it's a primordial religious mindset, right? Because I mean there are,

Speaker 2:          00:41:30       yeah, definitely Christian or Jewish, I mean ancient tribal, small scale, lots of gods. Right, right. Well, so then one of the things that you might suggest is that when you throw out a sophisticated religious structure, an unsophisticated religious structure comes in to fill the gap. I do. So that's true. That's definitely worth thinking about. So that's right. So that's right. The thing to the right with religions, we have to clarify a fundamentalism is the problem, not religion. And so if you close tribalism, that's right. If you get a fundamentalist, you know, I'm happy to stay. And if you have people applying to a Grad program in psychology and I find out that they're Christian, that's fine. There's no problem. But if they're fundamentalist Christian, I would think, well let's say let's say it's not psychologists, suppose it's, you know, geology. So someone applies to a geology program, there are fundamentalist young earth creationist.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       Are you gonna admit them? No, I don't think you should. They're not able to do the right kind of thinking based on what we know to be the case. They're there. They're not in the scientific paradigm, not in the Santa that's right. So, so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist Christian to a geology program, why would we admit someone who is just as fundamentalist about certain moral and political issues into a sociology program or into a psychology program if they come in knowing what the right answer is committed to that right answer. Likely to get angry at anyone who contravenes that right answer. Um, and, and showing signs of close mindedness. I don't think they belong in a grab the. I guess the question is how in the world do you set up mechanisms to ensure that you're not swamped by fundamentalists of any sort?

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       So those are people who are reducing everything to a single cause. It's something like that. How can you implement a structure that protects the organization against that without the structure itself becoming totalitarian? Because these things, these things spin out of control so fast. But so what we have to realize in the academy is that we face, I think we face an existential crisis. Um, we rely in enormous amount on public goodwill. We get enormous tax subsidies, a direct research support, and recent polling shows that while Democrats have always had a higher opinion of the universities and Republicans until two years ago, everybody thought universities are a good thing. They make life better. So Americans have been very supportive of higher education. There have been rising grapes on the right, but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that now republicans go from saying mostly universities are good things in two years.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       They go way down and say universities are bad things. They're making things worse. Now, how is this news greeted pundits on the Left Rsa? Oh, those republicans are so anti science. Look how ignorant they are. They now hate universities. Come on. Anybody who's been watching the news, anybody who's seen the mobs to shout downs, the illiberal behavior. You know, the metaphor I use is like, you know, Americans on the right and left are really supportive of the military. We have a, it's one of the few institutions that we still hold in highest team on both sides, and so the Republicans more than Democrats. So suppose you had Gallup poll and I, uh, showing Republicans liked the military more than Democrats, but both really like it. Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing video from all over military bases, the military academies in which the, the military leaders are overtly right wing.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       They're there, they're saying terrible things about leftists and progressives and the midshipmen and cadets, and everybody is mobbing the occasional liberal and they're behaving in a really despicable, scary and intimidating way. What do you think the left would now think about the military? Obviously support for the military would plummet and that's what's happening in America with universities. We are losing the support of half the country. This is unsustainable, especially in red states where they control the purse strings. So I think we have a major crisis. I think we've got to go into crisis mode and we've got to clean up our act. So just as we're doing in psychology with replication project W, we recognize that our methods weren't good enough and we're doing a crash course, a thanks to Brian Nosek and others, the open science project. We're really trying to improve our game. Thank God we need to.

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       I think we have to do the exact same thing about partisanship, um, and our, our duties. Okay. So let's talk about Heterodox Academy because you set that up, this organization that you should tell everybody about in, in precisely to deal with this issue. And so I'd like, I'd like to know about how it's growing, what it's doing, what your aims are, all of that. Yeah. So I gave this talk in 2011 laying out the fact that we have no more conservatives and social psychology and why this makes it hard for us to find truth. And uh, in the months after that, a few social psychologists resonated with the message. They said, wow, I think that, I think you're right. I have some data on this. So the five of us, six of us wrote this paper, came out in behavioral and brain sciences. I'm Charlotte a stern, I'm sorry, what's the sixth one that I forgot to add in before?

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       Um, we got this paper published and behavior and brain sciences. It came out, it was sort of online in 2014, but it came out for good in the summer of Twenty 15, which coincidentally was the same summer that my article came out with Greg Glucagon off of the coddling of the American mind. That was about things going on with undergrads. But our concern was entirely faculty. It was just the nature of the academic community, the research community. So we got these two things going on summer of Twenty 15. Um, and then that summer I hear from Nick Rosenkranz, a law professor who says we have the same problem in law, lost worse in law. Well, it really bad and Canada law. Okay. Because, and as he points out, we're training all these students, they never meet a conservative. Then they have to go argue cases in front of judges, half of whom were appointed by Republicans. They have no idea what a conservative thinks. This is malpractice. We've got to train. So say, and I hear from a sociologist, Chris Martin, same thing in sociology, so the three of us said, hey, you know, this is a big problem for the whole account. Have you looked at faculties of education? Oh my God, those are the worst by worst, I don't know the numbers, but in terms of the vindictiveness that the increased the pressure put on any nonconforming opinion. My impression, I don't have data, but my impression from the letters I get is that

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       education schools and social work schools are the worst. That's exactly in keeping with my. My understanding as well. It's hard to tell which of those two or worst I would say it's the faculties of education because they have a direct pipeline to kids, but in terms of their effect, farmer pernicious. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. But, but equally equally worked let's say, but but more pernicious and the things that are happening in the Canadian education system as a consequence of that or so reprehensible, which we'll get to that because it's happening here too with these ideas filtered down to high school.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       I've been so focused on college, now we're discovering the problem is actually baked in. The liberal attitudes are often baked in by the time,

Speaker 3:          00:48:24       right? Yes. And purposefully, like in, in Canada, increasingly the, the radical leftists have control over curriculum development and they're starting to develop social justice curriculum, which is what they call them for, for kindergarten kids. So let's finish up the headrest academy then we'll get back to the earlier grades. So, uh, so originally three of us decided to put

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       up a website. I invited all the other authors from the, the bbs paper. We invited a few other people working on this. And so for the first year we had this project, it was called Heterodoxacademy.org. Uh, we put the site up on about September 10th, I think it was a 2015 and it was just a community of researchers who are studying the problem of the lack of viewpoint diversity. Well, five days later the protest start at Missouri. So these are racially motivated protest or protest about racial insensitivity in racial problems at Missouri. Um, and at first it seemed like this is just a Missouri prompt, but coming in the wake of course, of of Ferguson and all the videos we saw of, of unarmed black men being killed by police, the, a lot of these concerns spread to other universities. The protests aren't just about race, but it was that fall of 2015, especially the Yale protest when the president of Yale validates their narrative that Yale's are racist place.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       We have to reform Yale and then it spreads nationally and now suddenly this is not just a faculty issue anymore. So even though it Heterodox Academy, we're mostly focused on the faculty were now seeing it's a complex ecosystem with all kinds of forces acting on universities so that between 2015 and 2017, the danger of speaking honestly about what you think about an academic or intellectual proposition has skyrocketed. The risk of being mobbed, ostracized, formally investigated by title nine people for each title. Nine people here, we're sitting here at Nyu, go to any bathroom, I'll, I'll, I'll show you on this floor. Go to any bathroom. There's a sign telling students exactly what number to call to report you or me if we say something that is, that someone takes to be a bias. Oh, so you have bias. You have bias investigation teams here. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       See, we haven't got to that point at that particular point in Canada yet. So I think we're farther ahead down that path in some ways but not quite as far and others. So yeah, that's really, that's really unbelievable. So things are changing very, very fast. It's not at all schools. Uh, but then again, things are changing so fast. We don't really know. We don't have good data on what's going on. What I can tell you though is that a, at Heterodoxacademy when we started out in 2015, there was a lot of suspicion. A lot of people on the left were afraid like, oh, is this some right wing group? Now very few of us are actually on the right. Um, but because we end up mostly speaking up for Libertarians and conservatives who are attacked or silenced, you know, people will think, oh, we must be right wing, but we're not.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       I mean, I'm, I've never voted for a Republican in my life, I've never given money to Republican campaign. Um, I'm now increasingly calling myself a liberal now that we see illiberalism flourishing. Um, but so when we started out, there was a lot of suspicion of us from many professors, but now that it's clear that the problems, these are not just a few anecdotes. This is the new normal, um, and it's not just in the university. So as you pointed out, that's right. It's reading, reading, reading, and it's not just in the U. S it's spread. When in Twenty 15, I thought it was uniquely American problem. Yes, it's in Canada and the UK and Australia and New Zealand. That's right. It is a uniquely anglosphere problem. This is really interesting. It's not on the continent very much at all. What about in the Nordic countries? No, I mean they have.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       So political correctness, you have lots of places. The unique thing that identifies this new culture is linking the political correctness with the sense of fragility. And this is something America's pioneered the idea that, um, so the in Britain, they've always had, um, uh, no platforming they call it. So if there's an end, there was an effort, British National Party, it's actual fascist party, you know. So if a, if a BNP is going to speak on campus, mob him, you shut it down. No, don't give him a platform. So, you know, you've had passionate politics certainly since the sixties. So that's not new and that's everywhere. Um, what's new is the American idea that if someone says something and it could be a sincerely expressed idea, not a racist rant, just like, well, I don't know. I think that maybe hormones do affect gender behavior. Can you say that?

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       Well, what if someone takes that as, as somehow essentially using gender and then saying that women are inferior or whatever, if they don't. Well happened to James Demora for. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So, um, so that's what's new is the idea that if someone says something that someone, a member of a protected or marginalized group is offended by, that person is harmed. If that person has harmed, we must protect that person and more ominously just in the last year or two. It's not just that they're harming their suffering, it's that this was violating his right violence. Well, that's part of the postmodern narrative. That and distributes whole thing to pass is so dangerous. The crossing the line into, into violence. It just occurred to me just like yesterday, I was thinking about this. Wait, the state is supposed to have a monopoly on violence, right? But if speech, especially his speech and her speech and the people, the speech of those people in that academic movement or on the and that, if their speech is violence, well the state is supposed to have a monopoly on their speech then.

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       And um, and if it's violence, well then we have a right to use violence back. The state doesn't have a monopoly on violence because our violence is, you know, morally motivated. So just the Orwellian and authoritarian implications of this move. Once you say that speech is violence, you're unlocking your opening Pandora's box. I mean your, your five steps down the road to hell. And I'd say we're about seven steps down the road too, so. Okay. You. So you're, you're that concerned about it. Okay. So now tell me how many, how many members are, if you don't have to discuss any of this obviously, but how many members of Heterodox Academy are there now? We have 1300 members, so once we opened up. So originally it was just for researchers who were studying this problem, but we had lots of people wanting to join and so we said, well, okay, why not?

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       And so we just said, right, if as long as you're a professor that is, you have a phd, you're living more or less the life of a professor, you have a university affiliation. So we now take adjuncts. If they have a phd, we take postdocs. Basically if you're in the guild, if you're living the life of a professor and you're concerned about the rise of intimidation, frankly, if you're concerned that our wonderful institution I love, I love being a professor, I love the academy and I feel like it's not just losing public respect, it's losing its ability to function. It's losing its ability to teach and do research on politicized topics, so there were more politicized topics all the time. That's. That's right, and there are a few in the natural sciences, not many, but there are some in the natural sciences as well. Anyway, my point is we're now growing very rapidly and something I'm very excited by is since we started having more violence on campus with beginning with birth and Middlebury, we're seeing a pervasive sense among people on the left that there really is this problem here that something has to be done and so we are finding much more acceptance now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       I'm from professors on the left, so I like to think about there's the liberal left, which is the great majority, and there's the illiberal left. We did a factor analysis of politically correct beliefs and found exactly that and that the and that the illiberal left was also high in orderliness. That's interesting. Just the authoritarian. Exactly. Predisposition and also kind of markedly declined was also characterized by a market, lack of verbal intelligence. Oh, that's point four. Well that. Oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Because one of the simplest formulation I've heard really great formulation from Mark Lilla, so mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op Ed, the New York Times week after trump was elected saying identity politics is a really foolish thing to do. It pushes lots of people over to trump's side. You have identity politics is part of the problem. Well, he writes this off Ed and one of his fellow professors at Columbia, I forget how she does it, but she basically says something about the, you know, the mask with eye holes, falls from his face, like, you know, he's a Ku Klux Klan member or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       And so Lilla Lilla who isn't the humanities, he's an intellectual historian. Lilla has this simple formulation. He says that's a slur, not an argument. And once they had that simple formulation, I realized, wow, that's almost all the pushback I've ever gotten. It's somehow, you know, oh, you know, you're winking at Nazis or your comfort to me over and over. I was just, my neighborhood was just posters with all that, the intimidation. So, so this is really key. We're supposed to be all about, you can say anything you want, you can make any argument you want, if you can support it, if you can back it with reasons. This is critical thinking and this is what we're supposed to train our students to do. Well, and not only that you can say anything, but you can say it. There's a boundary on that, which especially if you're a scientist, less so in the humanities, but if you're a scientist, the things you say have to be vetted by people who are going to be critical of them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:33       Right. So, so not only, not only there's accountability built into it. That's right. So I didn't mean to say you can say whatever you want rant. I mean you can put forth any idea you want, if you can back it up. What we're seeing with anything politicize is it's not about backing it up. Students are learning rhetorical techniques to link their enemies to something racist, sexist, contemptible sometimes. And those are the things that are not only worthy of being destroyed, but that you have a moral duty to destroy. Exactly. So that's right. So it's almost like the immune system, how exactly works, but there's some cell that tags Acel as enemy enemy and once that tag is put on the cell that attract other effort that what kind of sell to mob it and so we should look into this, this metaphor of the immune system, because once they know, once you're labeled as a racist, the students don't have to read you that it doesn't matter what you actually say.

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       You will now be attached to that. Once you're labeled that way, if someone defends you, the label is contagious. Dynamic. That's how we know we're in this super religious territory of witch hunts that if you stand up for someone, you are tagged and then you will be mobbed. And that's why there's so much that. And that's why there's so much cowardice on campus among both students and faculty. People are afraid to stand up even if the majority think that what's going on is nuts or is unfair. They're afraid to stand up and that's in part due to social media because it's just. I mean, students today had been raised with various platforms that make it easy for people to join in attacks, someone they look at who liked what. So if in that article we just saw on read a, there was a bit of a counterrevolution and read the students had to get together somehow and decide should I like that post? How about if we all liked it at the same time, then we'll get in less trouble. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       Okay. So to what degree. So let's talk about the aims of the Heterodox Academy. So you brought people together who are in principle interested in a diversity of opinions and but, but in what manner is that going to be utilized to, to, to, I don't want to use the word combat but to, but to deal with this emergent problem of ideological rigidity in the universities.

Speaker 2:          00:59:49       So two useful concepts here. One is the emperor's new clothes. Um, we all know that story. Even if most people, even if everybody sees this is nuts, the emperor's walking around with no clothes, they're afraid to say it until one person says it. So, and this is also the ash experiment, everybody says that that line is the same as that line. It's obviously not true. If one person says the truth, then nobody conforms after that. So the mere presence of a group of people who say, you know what, we actually need a diversity of opinions and the fact that on our site we'll publish things. So sometimes when professors are mob, like when Bret Weinstein was mobbed, you know, so I wrote an essay that stood up for him. Uh, we've done that for some of them. It's happening so fast, I can't keep up, I can't, I've got books to write and I, you know, every week there's some new member who's getting mobbed.

Speaker 2:          01:00:33       And so we're going to develop a team of people who will write. But just knowing that there are people who will stand up for you. Um, knowing that there are people who will say, wait a second, um, you know, this is not what we do in the academy. So that's one things we just stand up for each other too, is we develop products that we think can basically fix the situation. So one of our products is called the campus expression survey. It's a survey designed to actually measure who was afraid of speaking up about what topics and why, what are they afraid of? And it turns out everyone's afraid of the students more than the faculty. Uh, they're afraid of mostly to talk about race. What about the administrators? Everyone's afraid of the students. They're afraid of the students. So I don't have, we have not sorted them. I've only surveyed students, I don't know, but from what we hear people are afraid of, of the students, um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       hauling in its own manner. Like was that failure of leadership? That's for sure. They let those kids come into the classroom, the actual classroom and disrupt a class on an ongoing basis. I mean, yes, and I couldn't understand that exactly. I mean, my response to that would be first I would tell them to leave. Second, I would call campus security. Third, if something wasn't done about it, I just wouldn't teach the class. So I don't understand like it, it seems to me that it's also up to individual professors to draw a line, which is that if you're being intimidated dated by students, why do you, why do you show up and teach the class? I don't understand that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:04       So again, people are afraid to stand up if it means that people will call you a racist

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       cabot garden. I mean, it's weird in that situation though because it's carried to enroll her to go to your class, you know, and, and there's a much more proximal threats. That's what I mean. That's what I'm most alarming

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       by is the rise of intimidation. Intimidation is now a factor in many aspects of academic life and that's just terrible. That's completely incompatible with, with what we do and who we are.

Speaker 3:          01:02:31       Well, it's especially, it's especially appalling given that whatever happens in the university campuses, one of the Christians I'd faced in Canada as well, why should we care about what's happening in the, in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these people next year. You are. Well, yeah. Well, it's the heart like what's happening in the campus is going to happen in society in five years. It's already, it's already happened. This is actually an important point. Um, I've, I just gave a talk,

Speaker 2:          01:02:54       get a at a big law firm here in New York where they're very devoted to diversity, but they're doing it right. They're really thinking about diversity. Why is diversity good? And say have a whole month on viewpoint diversity, which is just fantastic. And what I'm learning from talking to a number of people in the business world is that in the last year they're now all these pressures on leaders to endorse this condemned that sign, this open letter and through human resources. That's right. That's right. But it's the same dynamic we have on campus and the answer to it. So if anybody, anybody watching here, if you run a business, if you have friends who are in business, I think the only, the, the, the, there are only two stable equilibria. One is that every organization is just either all right when we're all left wing, but that will be disastrous.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       So either you just say, okay, we're on one side that we terrible. The other is what we call the Chicago principles of free expression. The University of Chicago has the best statement out there on how the university provides a platform on which multiple views can contest the university does not take anyone's side. That's the only other stable alternative. And I think leaders need to do this in business. It certainly universities. So we're encouraging every university to adopt the Chicago principles because a lot of what mass action is, is an attempt to compel the authority to come in on your side and punish your enemies. Yep.

Speaker 3:          01:04:13       And so that has to stop. We can go how, how effectively is the Chicago statement on, on how effectively is the Chicago statement being disseminated? How rapidly our universities signing up

Speaker 2:          01:04:24       or, or um, there a few signed on early in this whole crisis. I'm a purdue, they're about 10 or 15 that have, that have endorsed it or something like it. Uh, it's not enough to just endorse something, but if you have leadership that's committed to creating an open platform in which people can disagree. Um, and I, and one sense very encouraging, I've been invited by a number of university presidents to come speak. We have all kinds of, of innovation to Heterodox Academy to foster a more inclusive climate in which people can actually engage with difference. There's a lot of interests. So I think the university leaders were very slow to react. They didn't want to alienate certain factions of students, but they're almost all reasonable people. They're almost all liberal left. I'm not illiberal. They're horrified by what's going on. They know they're sitting on top of a powder.

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       They don't want things to blow up in their face as happened at Evergreen. So this brings us to our, our, our, another product, the one that we're most excited by a. So I just went online, uh, actually, uh, today, uh, it's called the open mind platform. If you go to open mind platform.org, you can find we've developed a, an APP. We have a whole library of readings and videos who developed an APP that guides you through. We don't just say, here's how engaged with different viewpoints. We start by saying why is it good and we make the case that you need this. Everybody needs this. And to, um, we remind people that we're all basically self righteous hypocrites. We have quotes from wisdom traditions around the world and we've all heard this. So just a little bit of a, you know, you can call it emotional manipulation if you like, but just get people into a mindset in which they're willing to say, oh yeah, Whoa, calm down.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       We're all, we're all a on to self righteous here. And then we, then we teach them some psychology about motivated reasoning and only then do we teach them to engage with views that are not their own. So we've already run this in about 15 to 20 classes. Um, the results so far look promising that at the end of it, the measures show that students are more open to other ideas. So the open my platform, do you think is a tool that we think a lot of universities are going to adopt their. There's a lot of interest in it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       If there's leadership, if the professors generally do support viewpoint diversity and open inquiry. If we change freshmen orientation so that students are trained first and foremost in how to step back, give people the benefit of the doubt, be open minded. If we do that first, you know that's like behavioral exposure to some degree, right? The idea would be that if you're, if you're afraid or disgusted by something that you don't understand the appropriate treatment, first of all, the treatment is necessary because otherwise you'll isolate yourself in the ways that you already described and second, that brief exposure. Voluntary exposure's going to be the best curative. That's the opposite of the safe space. Id exactly need to be protected. Safe space. The safe space idea is the worst thing you could possibly do for the very people you're trying to. Exactly. Exactly mean to psychology, what you know, the psychology behind safe spaces and microaggressions is just the exact opposite of what we should be doing if we want to create kids, especially black kids, gay kids, we made whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:07:43       If you think that they are vulnerable to more stigma, more conflict if you think that they are vulnerable, that's especially when a safe space will be temporarily pleasant, but in the long run, bad for. Right. And that's the critical issue too with regards to safe spaces is that there are sacrificing the medium and longterm of the students' wellbeing, let's say to the short term lack of fear and conflict. Their infant dialyzing them essentially. So yeah. Okay. So. Alright, so I was thinking about discussion idea. I've got a personality test online now that's based on this big five aspect scale, but it might be interesting as something for us to think about to do, find people who are high in openness and low in conscientiousness or orderliness and offer them the opportunity to engage in dialogue with people who have the opposite personality traits. No, because, well, first of all, because they're going to run into people like that always, right. And, and, and, and maybe even establish a relationship with them inadvertently. And so being able to tolerate that might give them the kind of insight that you said you developed when you realized that the conservative ethos was based on a reasonable but not complete set of, of, of beneficial axiomatic presuppositions. So. Alright, so now this is pretty much taken over your life, this heterodox academy as well as the writing. Now you're writing a couple of new books. I understand. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       So, um, so since, so I was in the psychology department at the University of Virginia for a, for 17 years and one of my book, the righteous mind was coming out. I wanted to move to New York City for a year so I could do promotional work for it and I just had, my second child was just born and I knew it would be hard to fly from Charlottesville. So I just happened to get a position, temporary position here at Stern, at the business school. Um, and when I first arrived I wasn't that interested in business, um, but as soon as I got here, occupy Wall Street happened and suddenly it was like everyone's talking about morality and politics and capitalism and business. And then I started learning about the history of capitalism and I knew nothing about it was fascinating and I started seeing how free enterprise free markets have helped raise, wait, raise living standards around the world. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:09:57       Poverty in a staggeringly rapid fashion that's completely unprecedented threat, especially since the year 2000.

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       That's right. So since, so, you know, here I was 48 years old discovering it, nothing about it was like when I first learned about evolution, like wow, this explains everything in the natural world and learning about capitalism. Business explained everything about the built world and the world that we actually live in. Um, and they were also all these business scandals. This was 2011 and the wake of the financial crisis and I saw a huge opening to begin applying moral psychology to help corporations have better ethics. Um, so I've been, everything I do involves applying moral psychology to help complex systems work better, so I've been focused on political polarization and governance for years before then and that led to the righteous mind and then I got here to Stern, they offered me a job during that first year and I took it and it's been fantastic.

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       It's been really exciting. It's like a whole new, almost like being back in Grad school, a whole bunch of new things to learn. You must be a kind of a shock and existential shock to be in a business school in some sense. No, it's not, it's not a shock. I mean it's a different culture. It's much more open in the sense that it's so diverse like the things people are doing, there's not like a way that we do things here and it's much more open to applied projects to actually to applied projects. Yeah. And so it was a perfect time for me. Like I just, you know, the righteous mind that, that wraps up like the first half of my career, like everything I did is in that book and now it's time for something new and that new thing was going to be I'm looking at how morality or moral psychology both underlines or, or, or is the foundation for our ability to do capitalism like contracts, reciprocity, all sorts of things.

Speaker 2:          01:11:35       And how are left, right? Divide, um, from the righteous mind makes it hard for us to figure out what's true. Like if you're raised the minimum wage, does that help or hurt the working poor? Right. If you're an economist on the left, obviously helps them. If you're on the right, it obviously hurts them because fewer of them have jobs and you can gerrymander the measurement devices to reduce the conclusions that you want, which is a big problem. That's right. So I'm supposed to be writing a book called three stories about capitalism, the moral psychology of economic life. And so I started traveling around the world looking at how development is going in various countries. Uh, I did a three month trip to Asia in 2015. I came back from Asia, my article came out with [inaudible] off the colony, American mind. The bbs article was published, uh, and I thought, okay, now we can get back to this, you know, keep it in this capitalism book.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       And then the university is kind of began melting down in the fall and then we started heterodox academy. And so yes, it has taken over my life. It's, it's basically a full time job in addition to trying to write the. I'm also working on, so looking on it and I didn't want to turn our article into a book because we thought we'd said everything but men have things been happening fast and we've learned so much more since we wrote that article and that article when, how long? Well, we wrote it in late 2014 and then we edit it in early 2015 and it finally came out in August of 2015. Um, and so in our last October, Greg, uh, wrote to me and said, John, I think I do want to turn the article into a book because we know so much more now and it's, the problem is so much more serious than it was any evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       My God, the evidence about mental, the mental health crisis of adolescence when Greg and I wrote the article, we were, you know, we saw lots of hints that depression and anxiety were going way up and we think that's related to the, the overprotection yeah, part two. Okay. So let's, let's talk about that just for a sec and then go back to the book. So I've got a potential demographic explanation for that in part. Well, and I don't know if you guys have looked into this or not. Well, there's, there's two things that I think might be contributing to it. One is two or three things. One is the average age at which children are the average age at which people have children has gone way up. That's true. Okay. So why does that matter? We're all because I think people get more conservative and cautious as they get older a little bit, but that's true, but it's a very small effect and it's, wait a second, it's the having of the kids, which is what makes them more conservative.

Speaker 2:          01:13:55       When you have kids, you are more threat sensitive, you're more likely to vote for the right wing party. So just delaying child, child a childbirth wouldn't. Okay. What about, what about fewer siblings? That would. Yes. That's part of it. Uh, and this is what we're seeing in Asia too, when you have a lot of kids, you're not quite as worried. You don't have all your eggs in one basket. Well, and you can't quite as worried and the siblings raised each other. That's right. Right. And then there's a lot of keystrokes fight. Exactly. It's the free play and the fighting, the working things out for themselves. Those are essential skills of adulthood. Okay. So see, so then. Alright. So smaller family sizes. Part of it. Agree. Well, and then also what's happening increasingly in schools is that kids aren't allowed free play and there are certain not even allowed.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       Rough and tumble free play, which that's right. That's one of the biggest things about. So the two that there are three giant there. There are a lot of. I mean this is such actually it's really fun puzzle because it's like the biggest social science puzzle of our age. What is happening that's making so many of our systems go haywire and I'm focusing on the university. The big three I would say are one is the loss of, of free, of unsupervised freeplay. Yeah. And Peter Gray has been brilliant on this. He's a Boston college showing how even among young animals they have to practice the skills for adulthood. Yeah. And getting in, showing that too. Exactly. So getting in conflicts and then dealing with it and sometimes losing and you come back having game in which there's a problem but you have to work it out or the game stars.

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       That's what kids always did. It's only recently in the nine, beginning in the nineties that it they're always supervised because we're afraid if we take our eyes off them there'll be kidnapped and that was never a risk was never a risk. You know, I've kind of wondered about this gender flexibility issue as a form of delayed fantasy play. Good. And let me go ahead. Because it looks to me like that is, you know, when kids are little and three and four, say three to seven, they do a tremendous amount of identity play, you know, they pretend they're animals, they pretend they're their parents, they, they, they, they pretend they're girls. If they're boys, they pretend they're boys. If they're girls like they really do a tremendous amount of identity play. And one of the things that's been really puzzling me is, well, what happens if that isn't, um, if they never have an opportunity for that because they're not engaging in fantasy play, maybe it's just delayed till adulthood.

Speaker 2:          01:16:10       Oh, that's interesting. So because plate, it's almost impossible to overstate the importance of that rough and tumble play and then the fantasy play that enables you to adopt different identities. And then the negotiated games that you talked about that enabled people to handle both, both victory, but even more importantly, last. That's right. So that's possible. That could well be. I know that I have no, no opinion on, but the big three factors that I think are explaining, explaining part of what's happening on campus are one, the loss of the unsupervised place so that the kids have always, there's always an adult present and so they come to college and they expect there to be an adult and dean somebody if there's a conflict. That's one. Two is social media which hit just as ign, ign, Internet generation. This is Jean twinkies work, you know, we used to, we used to think that I'm a, we used to think that the millennial generation ends in 1998 or 2000, but gene 20 shows a looking at for large data sets that birth year 1995 kids born in 1995 and after are really different.

Speaker 2:          01:17:13       They're values are different. They have much higher rates of anxiety and depression, especially the girls. Boys have gone up, grows, gone way up. Um, and the reason seems to be that facebook lowered its age. Um, uh, so in 2005 you had to be a college student at a certain number of colleges to get facebook in 2006, you can be any 11 year old who lies and says that she's 13 and you've got a facebook account, um, uh, but then you're using on your parent's pc, it's in 2007. The iphone comes out and it saturates the market faster than any consumer product ever has. So by 2000, 10 or 11, a lot of adolescents have have facebook and other social platforms and this is just devastating especially to girls because it's not texting. Texting is just me to you, you know, that's back and forth. That's fine that, you know, we, when we were kids, you called your friends on the phone, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          01:18:09       The problem seems to be according to twinkie, it's especially platforms in which he puts something out and then you wait and see what everyone says and that especially as damaging to girls who already are at risk of eating disorders and image disorders. So girls become more susceptible to negative emotion when they hit puberty. Well, there, there, yes, yes. That's always been the case. Then there's another issue too with regards to female aggression. So no, it's clearly the case that males are more likely to be physically damaging slash aggressive than females are. But what females use his reputation savaging. That's right. So that's Nikki. Nikki crikey passed away a couple of years ago showed that if you add it all up, boys and girls equally aggressive, but the boys aggression is more physical. The girls, the more relational. So if you imagine a bunch of 13, 14 year olds in their middle schools and then you parachute in a whole bunch of iphones, everybody's got one of their pots in it before.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       What are the boys going to do? They're going to play video games and that doesn't hurt anybody, but the girls are going to use it to amplify the social interactions. So this is 20 twinkies explanation. I think it makes a lot of sense. So it's a, it's a catastrophe. It's a crisis and we're really hurting, especially the girls. Um, so we've got to change something about that anyway. But social media is, is possibly the largest single reason why things are going haywire on campus. The third big factor in, and do you think it's primarily facebook or can you tell? Well, it's, it's uh, uh, the kids use a lot of different platforms, but from what I hear, instagram, facebook, snapchat, it. Again, the thing is it's one to many. That's what's bad at anything if, if it's, if it's, you put something out there and you see how many people like it, that's what's right.

Speaker 2:          01:19:47       And there's always the threat that it'll go viral in a terrible way. So that's exactly the sort of damage limit that's perfectly limited damage. Unlimited downside to saying something. So what do you do? Careful. Right? So I don't know if I want to like that post because you know, I could get in big trouble for it. Right? Well the benefit to liking it as minimal and the potential catastrophe for this unless expected to like it, in which case you'd better like it because if you don't like it you'll get in trouble. So it's a much more of a mob mentality. Kids are afraid, you know, I'm not blaming the kids, I'm very sympathetic to them and these are, my kids are, my kids are 11 and seven, they're going to come up into this. Um, so the kids have been raised in a, in a social environment, it's much more about mob mob formation and mob attacks and Bob defend defenses against mobs.

Speaker 2:          01:20:30       Um, and then, so the third factor then is the political polarization and that purification or institutions. So if you imagine coming up in the nineties when political polarization is going up, we're beginning to hate each other more across party lines, but it's not that hard. Not that, that nasty, but it's been getting much, much more hostile so that now if someone, like, if someone's a, is, if someone goes to a campus Republicans meeting, if it's a Democrat who goes to a meeting of the campus, Republicans has happened at UC Santa Cruz a couple weeks ago, um, uh, and someone finds out, you know, the. So the, the, the, the hatred, the cross-party hatred is so much stronger now. And many institutions are much pure. So if you went to college in the nineties, there might've been a few conservative professors around, but now there aren't. So as you said before, it's like exposure therapy if you've never encountered a conservative idea.

Speaker 2:          01:21:20       And then if conservative like Heather Mcdonald comes to speak on your campus, well this is like a major immune response problem. We've got to get the tribe together and mob her and you know, shut her down. Um, so those are the. I mean there are many other reasons, but the loss of unsupervised play, social media and rice and polarization, those are the three big ones, right? Well those are big problems, especially the loss of unsupervised play. It's not, it's not obvious at all how that might be addressed. Yes it is. Okay, good. Good. Everyone should, just by Lenore skenazy, his book, free range kids and then they should loosen up and give their kids more unsupervised time. Now you can't do this alone. You'll be arrested. I tried to get my son to go out across the street to, you know, buy groceries when he was nine years old.

Speaker 2:          01:22:07       And he'd say, look, but you know, Daddy, people look at me funny there, there are other kids out there. Um, and so lenore has started a fantastic organization called let grow. So if you were to let grow.org, okay, we'll put all this in the description, all of these things, right? So I'm on the board of it as an advisor. Peter Gray, uh, expert on, on play is on the board and they're doing these simple things. Simple, simple things like you convinced the school to just open up the playground an hour early or keep it open after school. Why should kids always have organized activities and soccer practice? Just give them a place to play where there's a nurse available. If someone gets hurt, there is an adult but he's not supervising. He's just over there, right? So don't worry parents, there is an adult but beyond that can do what they want.

Speaker 2:          01:22:56       And they just started this a few weeks ago and the results are fantastic. The kids were having so much fun. They are becoming more independent, they're more willing to do projects on their own. It's working out great. So, oh, that's really good, do this on your own, but the thing is we all know something's wrong. So those are very practical, very practical piece of advice for, for schools. It's like open up the unsupervised play facilities and, and, and facilitate their use. That's right. Give, give everyone a place which is safe. And by safe, I mean physically safe, right? Never use the word safety to describe emotions and ideas. Safety means physical safety. So you've got to provide a physically safe place for the kids to play. And beyond that you let them go. Now there will arise. Problems of bullying. So if it's repeated harassment or you know, well, I know a book about God, which by down always called bullying, what we know and what we can do about it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       And it was written, it's got to be 30 years ago and always cut the real, the, the, the, uh, the, the incidents of bullying in the Scandinavian countries down by 50 percent. And he really, really targets what bullying means. So he's not a safe space guy by any stretch of the imagination. Um, I don't know what the origins of it are. I know that evaluations of his program in America show it anywhere from zero to 20 percent reductions in much smaller in the u. s in the U. s yeah. The question is whether or not they were able to implement them with the rigor he did in the U. S. yeah. But bullying programs are part of the problem because bullying clearly is a problem. We need to do something about it, but because we have what's called concept creep. Yeah. So, so it's not a bad concept.

Speaker 2:          01:24:33       Creep looks like even. Yeah, that's right. Uh, so now it's the case that if, if kids don't invite, if some kids want to do something and they don't invite another kid, they've excluded that kid. Right. Well that could be bullied. Right. I've read of schools in Europe that don't allow kids to have best friends for exactly that reason. Yeah. Well, because this is also something that really bothers me about the misuse of the iat because it's not that easy to distinguish in group preference, which no one can. No one went in their right mind. Would want to eliminate in group preference, given that it governs your choice of mate and your behavior towards your family members, let's say, to, to distinguish that between outgroup exclusion. There's no, no simple matter and to tell kids that they can't have a best friend is another thing that interferes with an important part of their.

Speaker 2:          01:25:21       That's right. Yeah. I think both of us have spent a lot of time looking at ancient wisdom at, at the writings of, of, of people long ago. Uh, and I, I often come back to aristotle's claim that any virtue carried to extremes becomes advice. So inclusion is a good thing if people are being excluded because they have a physical stigma or, or they're overweight or their skin color. So we need to be looking at the reasons why kids are excluded. But if you say inclusion is the primary virtue, inclusion over everything else. And so if those two best friends are excluding others, know more best friend, this is madness. This is a vice. So I think that again, you know, it's a virtue unless it's carried to extremes.

Speaker 1:          01:26:09       Well, that's probably a pretty good place to stop, I would say, unless you. Have, you have anything else that you wanted to talk about? We were, we talked about the role of religion and in the fact that people are naturally religious thinkers. We talked about the Heterodox Academy. We talked about your work on disgust and your plans for the academy. You talked about your books. Is there anything else that that might be of interest that you can think of?

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       Um, just that, uh, I'll just say that I'm actually optimistic about what's going to happen on campus. I think things might continue to get worse this year. Um, but I think there's an interesting phenomena called preference falsification when you have people not speaking honestly, as you had under communism, when you have a whole system where almost everybody thinks this is terrible. I hate this, but I don't dare say anything. When you have preference, falsification is to work by team or Koran. Um, and everybody hears everybody else's preferences. So they think, okay, that's what everybody thinks. When you have an unraveling, it can unravel very quickly. And that's what happened in the communist countries because everybody hated it and it felt amazingly quickly. And I think the, you know, the, the pushback at read last week or there was written up last week. So I think because most people, and we're starting to see is that a lot of people of color also is that, you know, you're not speaking for me.

Speaker 2:          01:27:36       I mean every group is diverse. And so when you have a variety of people and you have progressive speaking, when you have a variety of people, um, I, I think we're going to see more and more people standing up saying, wait, what's happening is this is not right. This is illiberal. This is opposed to the values of the academy. This is not what I want for myself or my kids or my students. So I do think that we're going to start seeing a lot more people standing up. Um, and one of our goals of heterodox academy is to just help put out the ideas that people need. And this is what you're doing to just put out the ideas, critique the bad ideas, and put out concepts in that that can contest in this space of ideas and get good information. So if people go to Heterodoxacademy.org on our research pages, we have all the information that, what all the polls say. What's the current information about, about students attitudes? We have the history of this. We have a lot of research on who is more biased, left or right. Well, turns out both sides are about equally biased. So we think that by just doing what we actually do well as academics, that is research making arguments, being common, civil, um, we actually think that we can turn this around. So if anybody watching this as a professor, I would invite you to join. Go to Heterodoxacademy Dot Org, uh, and science.

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       Okay. So, so let me ask you one more question. I mean, I'm, that, that sounds good and I'm, it's good to hear that you're optimistic. I mean, I, I waiver,

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       although I wouldn't say I'm pessimistic, I, I just think we're in one of those situations where things could spiral in either direction very rapidly and that worries me. What about the disciplines on campus that seemed to be primarily devoted to the activist cause? Like because my view is, or my fear is that we've subsidized the activist disciplines, let's say women's studies as a good example, but we could say social work and then the faculties of education now as well. I think they're in the same, in the same bin. Let's, let's, let's put it that way. That women's studies programs in particular, their express goal expressed on their websites is to produce social justice. Radical left leaning activists. And so like for awhile, one of the things I proposed in Canada was that the conservatives in particular cut the university funding by 25 percent so that the universities would have to sort themselves out.

Speaker 3:          01:29:58       But then that was, that was a provocative claim obviously. But then I thought, well that's not a good idea because it opens up the door to political interference in the academy and that's bad. That's left. No, that's right. That's right. But the academy has done a very bad job of policing itself methodologically and we have these disciplines. Women's studies I think is a prime example and that's been very much criticized in Canada by Janice Flamenco who used to be. Yeah. Yeah, she is. And she's, she, she's not an unnatural mill. You when she's doing such things, you know, she's, she's a brave and tough person and she's gone after the women's studies types on methodological grounds particularly. But, but there are people who are working full time at doing nothing but producing the kind of polar. So what do you have any thoughts about? Yes, I do. I think

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       so. I'm here. I teach in business school here and I teach a course called professional responsibility and I teach my students about their fiduciary duties, their duties to their employers, the duties that we have to each other. And fiduciary duty refers to a very, very high standard of care. If you're managing someone's money, you know, you, you really have to be committed to doing what's in their interest, not in your interest. And I think we need that concept in the academy. We have a mature project, we call it fiduciary duties or just professional duties, but I think we have two primary professional duties that we must never, never be tray one, the most important one in our role as scholars is our duty to the truth. We must never say things that we think are false or allow people to stay, things that we think are false because we're afraid if we challenge them, we'll get in trouble.

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       So we have a fiduciary duty to the truth and political, ideological commitments clearly warp us, they make us do things, they make us, they push us. Um, so we've got a whole. We've got to recognize that if we let our systems get out of whack, we are betraying the truth. Were systemically, or do you want to. If we ever went systemic, truth isn't problem. We are systemically betraying the truth in many of our disciplines. So I think we need an awareness of that and we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard than in our role as teachers. We have an here, we really can call it a fiduciary duty. These are people's children who are sent to us to educate, to enlarge their minds, to teach them skills. If we were to use them for our sexual pleasure, it's obviously a horrific crime, but what is it if we use them for ideological purposes, if we say you've given me your children to educate, I'm waging a political battle.

Speaker 2:          01:32:26       I'm going to try to get your statements, tools, ms.tools. That is horrific. That is unacceptable. We are violating our duties. So I think, right. But the response to that, especially from the postmodernist types is that that's all the ribs. There's only ideologic yeah. Perfect. So back to your original question, um, are there problem departments? Absolutely. So I want it to put forth these two commitments to truth and to educating not indoctrinating and universities that embrace these highest goals like the University of Chicago I think is the best candidate will probably find that they need to do something about department that don't live up to those goals, other universities. And I think Brown is leading the way on this one so far. I mean the early in 2015, the president had all kinds of statements about brown is committed to social justice, a fundamental bedrock commitment to social justice.

Speaker 2:          01:33:21       She said so if some universities choose to devote themselves to social justice, that's fine. Just be up front about it. Say So. So students will know if you want social justice training, you go to Brown. But if you want to actually be trained to find the truth to do research, you go to Chicago and I think we're going to see people flooding to Chicago and schools like it. So what I'm hoping what I'm hoping. So that's the mechanism there. If they, if they make, if they make their statements public that the choice of the students will be to go to the universities that hold the principles that you just described over the other one. So it'll be a marketplace choice. Exactly. That's right. So that's why I said when I talked about the emperor's new clothes, we have a situation, we have a gigantic market failure in which our top universities are offering a product that most consumers don't want.

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       And so my prediction is that Chicago is going to see a huge surge of applications this year. And if that's true, um, I think other universities are going, they're going to take notice. So I'm hoping that we'll see a schism in the American academy between those universities that stand up and say, this is madness. We are committed to providing a platform. We don't discriminate based on viewpoint and politics. That's the Chicago way. And those that say no whereabouts social justice come here and we will train you to fight for social justice and against the right. So if, if people have clear choices, then I think we're gonna see a big change. And that's why I'm optimistic. I think we're going to see that. Alright, well thank you very much. It was great talking with you.
