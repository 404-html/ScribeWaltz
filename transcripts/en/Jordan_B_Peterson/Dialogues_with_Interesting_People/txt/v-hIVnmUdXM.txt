Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       I've really been trying to understand the underlying psychology of postmodernism and its relationship with neo Marxism and then the spread of that into the universities and the effect on the culture and what I would like to start with is a description of your understanding of that because our, like I've presented to the people who are listening to me, my understanding of it. I interviewed Steven Hicks recently and he wrote an interesting book called explaining postmodernism, which I liked quite a bit. It's been criticized for being too right wing, although I don't think he's right wing at all. I think maybe you could characterize them as middle of the road conservative, but I would say he's more like a classic liberal, but I'm really curious about your views about what, what, what postmodernism is. First of all, I know you've, you've identified it with the, with the general tricksters, Duroda and Latina and Sukkot and football in particular you've talked about, but I'd like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think it's been so attractive to people.

Speaker 3:          00:01:17       Well, my explanation is that there is no authentic 19 sixties point of view in any of the elite universities. Okay. But rather, the most liberated minds of my generation were 1960. It did not go onto graduate school. I witnessed with my own eyes. I saw genuine marxists. Okay. At my college, which was the State University of New York at Binghamton, upstate New York, a Harper College, which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews. Okay. Who, in fact, the Harper, what we used to be called Berkeley East. So I saw genuine, passionate marxists with my own eyes. They were not word choppers at. They were not snide postmodernists, right? They weren't in your face aggressive. They use the language of the people. They had a populist energy. Hey, they dressed working class. There were non materialistic. Hey, these are people who lived by their own convictions. They were against the graduate school.

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       So when I, when I, uh, went onto graduate school and it became known that I was going to go to Yale, I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus or in broad daylight in front of everyone who denounced me for Grad school is not where it's happening. You don't, you don't do that. If you have to go to graduate school, you should go to buffalo now. And I had applied to these students to suny buffalo because the great leftist critic, Leslie fiedler was there. What a huge impact on me. He's right. He created, created identity politics, but without its present distortions, uh, and Norman Holland, the second one, little critic was there. I will be very happy to have gone onto buffalo, but I needed the library again. So I continued on to. Yeah, the word no in the, in the graduate schools from 1968 to 72 when I was there were only one radical todd Gitlin.

Speaker 3:          00:03:07       Okay. Went on to have a career success. Okay. The actual radicals of the 19 sixties, right. Either when off dropped out of college and went off to create commune. So I or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains. Now I have also written about that, the destruction of the of the minds. Okay. I'll for the most talented members of my generation through Lsd, it was going on all around me towards what's happened is the actual legacy of the sixties got truncated. The idea that these poststructuralist and postmodernist are heirs of the 1960 [inaudible] revolution is an absolute crock. Okay. What they represent as Fuko shows, shows Fuko said, okay, the biggest influence on on his thinking was Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot. Okay. Which was a post World War Two play written in Paris. That was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced after Hitler went through occupied France and all of Europe was in ruins and had nothing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:04:09       Waiting for Godot has nothing to do with the authentic legacy of the 19 sixties, which was about genuine multiculturalism, a movement toward India. Hinduism. I a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics, which I take but which identify with totally through the music, etc. Right? It was a turn toward the body. It was a tuRn towards sensory experience. Okay. I'm not this, this word shopping thing and this cynical removal from an actual experience that french import. Okay. Came in. Okay. To the graduate school, it did not affect any genuine 19 sixties person. The real 19 sixties revolution was about young. It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms and the union contribution went on into the new age movement of the 19 seventies. Aside from the universities. So who took over the universities were these careerists hey, I saw them with my own eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       I saw what happened. I thought I was at yale when derrida was being shipped over to, to address the, uh, you know, the, the student is around students and the faculty. And I said to a fellow student after hearing one of these guys speak. It wasn't dairy die. It was, it wasn't another one of the theorists. I said, they are like high priests murmuring to each other. This, this was an elitist form from the start. Okay. It was not progressive. It was not revolutionary. It was reactionary. It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before. The 19 sixties sensory revolution was this postmodernist thing. Okay. This trashing. Okay. Of of the text. This is this, this encouragement. Okay. Have a superior and destructive attitude toward the work of art that we're going through. It's okay. Primly with red pen in hand.

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       Finding all the evidence of sexism. Check racism, check homophobia. Check. That is not the empathic emotional. Okay. Sensory based. Okay. A revolution of the 19 sixties I, I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mental from the 19 sixties. They're frauds. These people are. What happened in the 19 seventies was a collapse of the job market in academia. All of a sudden those jobs were scarce and this thing was there. The new and improved and shiny thing to be a fearless. People seized on it. It was institutionalized and it's an enormous betrayal of the 1960 [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       Can you. You touched on this idea of the destruction of the work of art. You know, and one of the things I really liked about reading nature was his discussion of resolved them all right, of resentment and, and it seems to me that a tremendous amount of the motive power that drives the postmodernist, let's call it, it's not a revolution. Um, transformation seems to me to be driven by resentment about virtually anything that has any. Well, what would you say? Any merIt of competence or aesthetic quality. And I don't know if that's, it seems to me that that's partly rooted in the academics. Disdain for the business world, which I think is driven by their relative economic inequality because most people who are as intelligent as academics are from a pure iq point of view make more money in the private sphere. And so I think that drives some of it. but there also seems to be this. There's a destruction on aim for destruction of the, of the aesthetic quality of the, of the literary or artistic work. It's reduction to nothing but some kind of power game. And then surrounding that, the reduction of everything to something that approximates a power gate, which, which I can't help but identifying with jealousy and resentment as a, as a fundamental motivator. Does that seem reasonable to you?

Speaker 3:          00:07:55       Professors? Okay. Who allege at art is nothing but an ideological movement by one elite, a against the against another group, right? These people are philistines the philistines. They're middlebrow, hopelessly middlebrow, or they. They have no sense of beauty. They have no sense of the aesthetic. Now, marxism doesn't need a search. This moccasin tries to reconfigure the universe in terms of materialism. It says it does not recognize any kind of spiritual dimension. Now I'm an atheist, but I see the great world religions as enormous works of art as the, as the, as the best way to understand the universe and man's place in it. I find them enOrmously moving that they're there. They're like enormous pole, and I and I would, I have called for the true revolution. Okay. Would have been okay to make the core currIculum of world education the world. Okay. The great religions of the world feel that is the only way to achieve an understanding and it's also a way to, to, to present the aesthetic.

Speaker 3:          00:09:00       Okay. Because I feel that, that the, that the real sixties' vision was about xcel, taishan, elevation, cosmic consciousness. So I, all of these things were rejected. Okay. By these, by these midgets. Okay. Intellectual midgets who seized onto lecan, derrida and fuko. Right. It's an and my career has been in the art school. So I made my entire career beginning of anything college. Uh, so I, I represent a challenge to this from the perspective of art. It is an absolute nonsense. Okay. As post structuralism maintains that reality is mediated by language, by words. Everything that we can know, including gender is absolutely madness because I'm, I'm teaching students whose majors are ceramics. Okay. Our dance. Okay. Who are jazz musicians who understand reality in terms of the body. It's sensory activation. So now what? See, what happened was something was going on in the art world as well.

Speaker 3:          00:09:58       I identify with andy warhol and pop art. Okay. That was what was going on during my years in college. Everything about andy warhol was like, wow, admiration. Wow. What happened immediately after that in the arts? Nineteen seventies. okay. Was this collapse into a snide sort of postmodernism? also? This happened in the art world and it was an utter misunderstanding of culture. It seems to me by that movement in the art world that is a oppositional art, in my view, is dead. Okay. It's been this what? Postmodernism is. Isn't it pathetic attempt to continue the old hero as some of the avant garde? The avant garde was genuinely heroic from the early 19th century. Okay. We, we're talking about, you know, where the core bay, the realist, you know, we're talking about monet and the impression is people who are genuinely suffered for their radical ideas and new innovations and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       I going right down to dirt to picasso and down to a to jackson pollack who was, who truly suffered for his art. It was only after his death. Okay. That suddenly the market was created for abstract art. Pop art killed the avant garde. The idea that the avant garde continues. It's an absolute delusion of the contemporary art world now, which feels that it must attack attack, attack, challenge. Okay. The, the, the simplistic belief. So the toy poodle. Okay. It's somehow the arctic. What? Excuse me. Okay. All right. From the moment. Okay. Andy warhol went through and embraced of the popular media in britain instead of having the opposition to it, the serious artists have had. That was the end of oppositional art. Okay, so we had been going on now for 50 years. The postmodernism in academe is hand in hand with the stupidity and infantilism that masquerades as you know, as as important art and galleries everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       This incredible, incredible, you know, it's mechanism oF contemporary art to pushing things that are, that are so hopelessly derivative that with this idea that once again that the art world, some houses a period of view of reality, the authentic leftism is populist. Okay? It is based in working class style, working class language, working class direct emotion and an openness and brushing some speech. Okay. Not this fanCy, contorted jargon of this pseudo leftists of academe who are frauds. These people, these people who managed to manage to rise to the top and ended at berkeley at harvard and princeton. Okay. Have any of These people are radical? they are career people. Their corporate types. Okay. The who like who succeeded in and they love the institutional contacts. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy, which has totally invaded in usurped. Okay. The year they have an academe everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       Okay. These people are company pl players. They could have done well in any, any field and then they, they love to sit in endless committees. They love bureaucratic regulation and so on. There's not one, not one leftist. Okay. And american academe raised his or her voice against obscene growth. Growth of tuition costs which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people. Not, not one voice. Okay. To challenge that. That invasion by the bureaucrats. Actual fascist bureaucrats. Okay. Well, if it were for added, they're like the cancerous. okay. There's so many of them because the faculty have completely lost any power in american academia. Okay. It's us. It's a scandal. What has happened and they deserve the president's servitude that they're in right now. Okay. Because they never protested when I my first job at bennington college, 1976, I was there when there was an uprising by the faculty against encroachment, by the board of trustees and the president. okay. And it was a huge thing. It was, it was, it was reported on the New York times and so on. And we. And we pushed that precedent out. Okay. And, and there's not been a single uprising of mankind against, against encroachment, by the trustees and by the administrations and all these decades. Okay. Pass them slaves. Slaves. They deserve their slavery.

Speaker 2:          00:13:47       Yup. I couldn't agree more. I thought the same thing about university professors for a long time is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say no. And the fact that in the United States, it's not quite as bad in Canada, I wouldn't say, but the fact that the students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here for their student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of the students' future earnings. Right. And they do that by offering them an extended adolescence with no quality control, something like that. So it's a real bargain with the devil.

Speaker 3:          00:14:26       And, and I told the abandonment of any kind of education actually in history and culture, right? They haven't going along with it. That is the transformation into a cafeteria kind of a menu. Okay. We can pick this course or that course or this course without any kind of guidance from the university about a central core curriculum that teaches you history and chronology and introduces you to the basics. Because our professors are prima donnas. They can only teach and their little areas. So we have this total fragmentation. Okay. And the, the, the great art history survey courses are being abandoned stedelijk because why? Because graduate students that are not trained to see the great narratives or the network because we are taught now that narratives are fault.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       Okay. So that's another issue that I'd like to bring up because one of the things I cannot say grote is the alliance between the postmodernists and the neo marxists. I can't understand the causal relationship there because the. Tell me if you disagree with this. Okay. Because I'm a psychologist, not a sociologist, and so I'm dabbling in things that are outside of my field of expertise and there is some danger in that, but the, the central postmodernist claim seems to me that because there's a near incident number of ways to interpret a complex set of phenomena which, which actually happens to be the case that you can't make a case that any of those modes of interpretation are canonical and so if they're not canonical and if that canonical element isn't based in some kind of reality than it serves some other master. And so The master that it hypothetically serves for the postmodernists is nothing but power because that seems to be everything that they believe it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       They don't believe in competence. They don't believe in authority. They don't seem to believe in an objective world because everything is language mediated. So it's an extraordinarily cynical perspective that that because there's an infinite number of interpretations, none of them are canonical. You can attribute it to everything to power and dominance. Okay. So that, that seemed like a reasonable summary of the radical. It's a radical relativism now, but the strange thing is despite. Okay, and so what goes along with that is the demolition of grand narratives and so that would be associated, for example, with the rejection of thinkers like young and Eric Norman, because of course their foundational thinkers in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand narratives that's never touched. But then despite the fact that the grand narrative is rejected, there's a neo marxism that's tightly, tightly allied with postmodernism. That also seems to shade into this strange identity. Politics and I don't. Two things. I don't understand the causal relationship there. Like the skeptical part of me thinks that postmodernism was a, was an intellectual. It's intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the kind of pathological marxism that produced the soviet union and that has no independent existence as an intellectual field whatsoever. But I still can't understand how the postmodernists to make the no grand narrative claim, but then immerse themselves in this grand narrative without anyone pointing out the evident contradictions. Like I don't understand that. So what do you think about that?

Speaker 3:          00:17:33       well, I can only speak about literary and professors really, and they seem to me almost universally in theu , s to being very naive or they, they, they seemed to know nothing about actual history, political science or economics. It's simply an attitude. They have an attitude in marxism become simply a badge by which they telegraph their, um, their solidarity with the working class that they have nothing to do with. Right. I mean they literally nothing but contempt. Yes. And, and the thing is that the campus left us are almost notorious for their, uh, for their rather snobbish treatment of staff. I mean, they don't, they don't have any rapport with the actual working class members of the, um, of the infrastructure, the janitorial, the janitors, and even the, even the secretaries, there's was kind of high and mighty aristocracy, you know, about. And they were just, these are people who, um, who have wandered into the english department and our were products of a time when, during the new criticism they were when history, but history and psychology had been excluded.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       Me and my ambition. Okay. was, I mean, I love the new criticism. okay. As a, as a style of textual analysis. Right? And, and the, and the new criticism had multiple interpretations. Okay. that were possible and that, and they were encouraged. In fact, one of, one of the great projects was made in max series 20th century views, what you had at least books. I adored them in college. And it was about Jane Austin or above emily bronte or about, um, words worth and they were collections of alternate views of the same thing. The idea that no more, no alternate views and there was no relativistic situational kinds of, of interpreter approach is nonsense. Okay. Um, but the point was we needed to restore history to literary literary study. OkAy. And we needed to add psychology to it because it was, was great animus against freud when I arrived in, in graduate school.

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       In fact, I actually went into the director of graduate studies and protesting the way freud and freudian were used as, as negative terms pay in a sneering way by that very wasp professors. So we need to do. And actually it seemed like we were moving there in the early 19 seventies was a great period of psycho biography about great. About political figures. Okay. And So I thought it's happening in all of a sudden they'd all got short circuited by this arrival, you know, of, of post poststructuralism and postmodernism in the, in the, in the 19 seventies. Right. Um, so I, I, I feel I'm an old historic assist. okay. Now not a new historical. So I mean I think new stores, so it was an absolute scam and it's like, it's just a way. It's like tweezers you'd like just, you pick a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of that you make a little tiny salad and some of this atomized thing, right?

Speaker 3:          00:20:13       It's supposed to mean something. It's all can be very superficial, very cynical, very distance. I like, I am a, I am the product. Okay, of old historicism german philology. I decide my first choice of a profession when I was a child. What was egyptology archeology, because I'm on. Everything I ever think about or say is is related to an enormous time scheme. Okay. From from antiquity and indeed from the stone age, and that is the problem with these people. They're their male educated, the postmodernist and academic marxists. Okay. Are male educated embarrassingly so. Okay. they know nothing before the present for call. Okay. It's absolutely a joke before the enlightenment. Okay. Immune. Perhaps he might be useful to people to talk about what happened at after neoclassicism, whIch by the way, he failed to notice a lot of what he was talking about. Okay. Turns out to cb simply the hangover of neoclassicism. Okay. This, this is how ignorant that man was. I mean his head was. He was not talented as a researcher. He knew absolutely nothing. Okay, well, you know nothing about antiquity. How can you make any kind of large structure, but I'm large mechanism to analyze western culture without knowing about classical antiquity. Okay. He did not see anything. He gets some person who had no business making large theoretical statements about anything.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       Well, maybe, maybe part of it is that if you, if you generate an intelligible doctrine of radical relativism, then there is no reason to assume that there are distinctions between categories of knowledge or between different levels of quality of knowledge. Right. so I've seen the same thing in the psychology departments, although we have the, uh, what would you call it? The luxury of being bounded at least to some degree by the empirical method and by biology, right? It's one of the things that keeps most of the branches of psychology relatively sane, you know, because the real world is actually built into it to some degree. But If you accept the postmodernist claim of radical relativism, then you completely demolished the idea that there are quality levels that are associated with education because everything becomes the same. And that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable justification for maintaining ignorance.

Speaker 2:          00:22:23       You know, like through co. I actually found him the most readable of the lacan. There are de fuko triad. You can read fuko. I read mad distance civilization and a couple of his other books and I thought they were painfully obvious. You know, the idea that mental disorder is in part a social construct is self evident to anybody who has even a smattering of psychiatric training. I mean the real narrow medical types tend to to think of a mental disorder, let's say as something that might be purely biological. They have a peer disease model, but nobody's who's a sophIsticated thinker ever thinks that it's a bit partly because medicine is a brand of engineering, not a brand of science because it's associated with health and the diagnostic categories are hYbrids between physiological observation and sociocultural condition. Everyone knows that and so when I reaD madness and civilization, I thought, well, that's not radical. That's just bloody self evident.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       I actually think that he began, you know, the entire turn toward a theological grounding of modern psychology, social psychology well launcher, the 19 twenties for example. You know, the levels of ignorance of these. These people moving foco with all original have not read durkheim. They've not read mocks of or they've not read erving goffman. Okay, so in other words, to me, for everything is the costing of the estimate because I had read the from which he was borrowing without attribution. so I mean, again, I know these people I've met, um, in some cases knew them in graduate school, people who went onto become these, these, these admirers of lack on dairy and I know what their training was there. Training was purely within the english department. That's all they ever knew. they never made it any research outside of that. Right. Is the idea for coal is simply this is a mechanism. It's like a little tiny kit by which they can approach everything in culture and then, and then the see, but the contortions of language that deliberate labyrinthine elitists language at the same time as pretending to be a leftist. Okay. This is one of the biggest frauds. every practice.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       so I got a story to tell you that you might like because I've thought a lot about that use of language, you know, because language can be used as camouflage. And so here's the story. I think I got this from robert sapolsky. So he was talking about zebras and zebras of course have stripes and hypothetically that's associated with camouflage, but it's not a straightforward association because zebras are black and white and they're on the velt along with the lions, the lions are camouflaged cause their grass colored. But the bloody zebras are black and white. You can see them like 15 miles away. So okay. So biologists go out to study zebras and they're like making notes on a zebra and they watch it. Then they look down at their notes and then they look up and they think, oh no, no, no. Which cbre I was looking at.

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       So the camouflage is actually against the herd because the zebras, a hurt animal, not an individual. And so the black and white stripes break up the animal against the herd so you can't identify it. so this was a quandary for the biologists. So they did one of two things. One was drive a jeep up to the, to the zebra, heard and use a dab of red paint and dab the horn. Should the zebra or tag it with an ear tag like used for cattle. The lions would kill it, so as soon as it became identifiable the pro, yes, the predators could organize their hunt around that. Identify about animal. That's why you know, there's the old idea that lions and predators take down the weak animals, but they don't. They take down the identifiable animals. So that's the thing is if you stick your damn hand handout, you get picked off by predators and so one of the things that academics seem to do is congregate together in heard like entities and then they share a language, right, and the language unites them and also keeps them as long as they share the same set of linguistic tools among themselves that they know that there isn't anybody in the, in the codery that's going to attack them or destabilize the entire herd.

Speaker 2:          00:26:18       And that seems to me to account for that Impenetrable use of language. it's, it's, it's group protection strategy and it has absolutely nothing to do with the search for. It's the search for security within a system and not the desire to expand the system. Right. Not

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       federal, but intimate is blatantly careerist because they made. It was, it was about advancement and with also about the claim that somehow they have special expertise. This is a special technical language. No one else can understand it. Only only weekend, but what's absurd about it absolutely ludicrous that these people, these, these american academics are imitating the contorted language of french at the translations from the french. Okay. When that call is translated into, into english, right? There's a contortion there. okay. Well, here's what he was trying to do in french was to break up. Okay. The neoclassical formulations that descended from racine, there was something that was going on. There was a sabotage of the french language going on that was necessary in France. Not necessarily in english. We have this long tradition of poetry. Going back to the shakespeare and chaucer. We have, we have our own language, but far more vItal than that than the french.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       The french constrain their language all the time. The absurdity in the amateur is okay of american academics trying to imitate. Okay. A translation of like hall, okay, we doing something in France that is absolutely not necessary and indeed wrong to be doing in english, but the other, the other cynical abandonment. Okay. Have the great tradition of, of, of, of uh, of the english departments. And I, I felt that the true radicalism was not about adding on other departments. Okay. So we have african american studies and you know, and, and, and women's studies and so on. The true radicalism would have been to shatter the departmental structure. That's what I wanted. I feel that was the authentic revolutionary 19, 67 to do, right. Don't look to them to blend all the literature, literature, study saudis together. Okay. Just to make easIer to make an interdisciplinary kind of organization or you know, closer to the british model where a person can pursue related subjects, overlapping subjects.

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       These, these, these departmental models. Okay. Are, were, were to me, totalitarian to begin with. Okay. separating language into fiefdoms and, and, and what, what the stitch to create a english women's studies department. Absolutely. Out of the air. Just snap your fingers and create women's studies. The english department had taken a century to develop. Okay. And was. It was a huge argument. Okay. Within. Within it. Right. And all of a sudden to create. Okay. It department where they politicize agenda from the start. Okay. By people without any training whatsoever in that field. And what should be the. What should be the parameters of the fIeld, which would be the requirements of that feel. How about biology? Okay. If you're going to be discussing gender, that should have been a number one requirement. Okay. as part of any witness studies department or program. But no, it was all hands off.

Speaker 3:          00:29:08       it was just the administrators wanted to solve a public relations problem. They had a situation with very few women faculty nationwide at a time when the women's movement had, had just started up that spotlight of attention was, was on them. They want, they needed women faculty fast. They need to do with the women's subject on the agenda fast. Right. So they just start let there be women's studies. Okay. And now we'll just hire some women. It usually from english departments, you know, here and there and we'll just throw them together. You invent it, you say what it is, so that's why women's that has got frozen at certain point of the ideology of the early 19 seventies. I was already in revolt from it. Okay. I went, I was a precursor in terms of my endorsement of feminists some before it, before even now is created. Right. But I couldn't. I couldn't even have a conversation with any of these women. They were hysterical about this subject of biology. they knew nothing about hormones and I. I mean I, I, I probably got in fist fights over this. They went. People were so convinced that biology had nothing whatsoever to do with gender differences.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       That also seems to me to be related to the postmodern emphasis on power because there's a, there's something terrible underground going on there that is an. I think this is the sort of thing that was reflected in the soviet union to, in the, especially in the twenties when there was this idea of radical idea that you could remake human beings entirely, right? Because they have no essential nature, and so if your fundamental hypothesis is that nothing exists except power and you believe that, then that also gives you the right in some sense to exercise your power at the creation of the kind of humanity that your utopian vision envisioned. Then that has no fat and that also seems to me to justify the postmodern insistence that everything is only a linguistic construct. It again gOes down to the notion of power, which dera done food co and luck tower, so bloody obsessed with.

Speaker 2:          00:30:56       and so, and it seems to me what they're trying to do is to, uh, to take all the potential power for the creation of human beings to themselves without any bounding conditions whatsoever. RIght? There's no history, there's no biology, there's, and, and everything is a fluid culture that can be manipulated at will. and so I, in Canada, there are terrible arguments right now about biological essentialism, let's say. And one of the things that happened, which was something I objected to precisely a year ago, is that the social constructionist view of human identity. He has been built now into canadian law. So there's an insistence that biological sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual proclivity very independently with no causal relationship between any of the levels. And so that's In the law and not only is it in the law, it's being taught everywhere, it's being taught in the armed forces, it's being taught in the police, it's being taught to the elementary school kids and the junior high school kids and underneath it all, I see this terrible striving for arbitrary power that's associated with this crazy utopianism and, and, and, but I still don't exactly understand it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       I don't like, I don't understand that. What seems to be the hatred that motivates it that you see bubbling up, for example, in identity politics and, and in the desire to do nothing but let's say demolish the patriarchy. It kinda reminds me, and this is something else I wanted to talk to you about, you know, in your, you're an admirer of Eric Norman and have girl young. Yeah. And that's the human connection is really interesting because I think he's a bloody genius. I really liked the great mother is a great book and it really a great warning. That book and also the orIgins and history of consciousness is one of the most influential book. Yeah. Yeah, but that's so interesting. I read an essay that you wrote or I don't remember

Speaker 3:          00:32:38       again at

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       the nyu. Yes, yes. It's always been staggering to me that that book hasn't had the impact that it should have had. I mean young himself in the preface to that book wrote that that was the book that he wished that he would have written. It's very much associated with young symbols of transformation and it was a major influence on my book maps of meaning, which was an attempt to outline the universal archetypes that are portrayed in the kind of religious structures that you, that you put forward, but the thing that I really see happening, and you can tell me what you think about this and in norman's book consciousness, which is masculine symbolically masculine for a variety of reasons is, is viewed as rising up against the countervailing force of tragedy from an underlying feminine, symbolically feminine unconsciousness. Right. and it's something that can always be pulled back into that unconsciousness that would be the microcosm of that would be the friday and eatable mother femineity dynamic where the mother was so over protective and all encompassing that she interferes with the development of the competence, not only of her sons, but also of her daughters, of her children in general.

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       And it seems to me that that's the dynamic that's being played out in our society right now is that there's this and it's, it's related in some way that I don't understand to this, to this insistence that all forms of masculine authority or nothing by tyrannical power. So The symbolic representation is tyrannical father with no appreciation for the benevolent father and benevolent mother with no appreciation whatsoever for the tyrannical mother. Right? And that's that. And because I thought of videology as fragmentary mythologies, that's where they get their archetype will in psychological power, right? And so on and balanced representation. You have the terrible mother and the great mother as, as norman laid out so nicely and you have the terrible father and the great father. So that's the fact that culture mangles you have to death well, it's also promoting you and developing you. You have to see that as balanced and then you have the heroic and adversarial individual.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       But in the postmodern world, and this seems to be something that's increasingly seeping out into the culture at large, you have nothing but the tyrannical father, nothing but the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent, benevolent great mother and it's an, it's an appalling ideology and it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality once, which is exactly what you would expect symbolically. It's sucking the vitality of our culture. You see that with the increasing demolition of, of young men, um, and not only young men in terms of their academic performance, which like they're falling way behind in elementary school way behind in junior high and bailing out of the universities like mad. And so,

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       and I, I, well the public school education, it's become completely permeated by this kind of anti male propaganda. I mean, and to me, public schools, I just a form of imprisonment, you know, right now they are particularly destructive to young men who have a lot of physical energy, right? Uh, yet now I identify as transgender gay mike myself, but I do not, I do not require the entire world to alter itself okay. To, to fit my particular in the self image. I do believe in the power of hormones. I believe that men exist and women exists and are biologically different. I think that I think there is no cure for the cultural ills right now except if men start standing up and demanding that they be respected as men again.

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       Okay. So I goT a question about that. So, so one of the things we did a research project year ago, trying to figure out if there was such a thing as political correctness from a psychometric perspective to find out is there the loose aggregation of beliefs actually clumped together statistically. And we actually fOund two factors which I won't go into, but then we looked at things that predicted adherence to that, that a politically correct creed. And there were a cOuple that were surprising. One was being female was a predictor, the personality attributes associated with femininity, so that would be agreeableness and higher levels of negative emotion. We're also both independent predictors but so were symptoms of personality disorder, which I thought was really important because part of what I see happening is that like I think that women whose relationship with men have, has been seriously pathologized, cannot distinguish between male authority and competence and male tyrannical power, like they failed to differentiate because all they see is the oppressive mail.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       And then they may have had experiences that, that, um, their experiences with men might've been rough enough so that, that differentiation never occurred because it has to occur and you have to have a lot of experience with men and good men do before that will occur. BuT it seems to me that we're also increasingly dominated by a view of masculinity that's mostly characteristic of women who have terrible personality disorders and who are unable to have healthy relationships with men. Now. But here's the problem, you know, this is something my wife has pointed out to. She said, well, men are going to have to stand up for themselves, but here's the problem. I know how to stand up to a man who's, who's, uh, unfairly trespassed against me. And the reason I know that is because the parameters for my resistance are quite well defined, which is we talk, we argue, we push, and then it becomes physical, right?

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Like if, if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse, we know what the next step is. Okay. THat's forbidden in, in discourse with women. Right? And so I don't think that men can control crazy women. I don't think. I really don't believe that. I think that they have to throw their hands up in, in, in, in what, in, in not even disbelief. It's that the cultural, there's no step forward that you can take under those circumstances because if the man is offensive enough and crazy enough, the reaction becomes physical right away. Or at least the threat is there. And when men are talking to each other in any serious manner, that underlying thread of physicality is always there, especially if it's a real conversation, keeps the things civil arts to some degree, you know, if you're talking to a man who wouldn't fight with you under any circumstances whatsoever, then you're talking to someone to whom you have absolutely no respect, but I can't see any way.

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       For example, there's a, there's a woman in in toronto who's been organizing this movement, let's say against me and some other people who are going to do a free speech event and she managed to organize quite effectively and she's quite ofensive you might say. She compared us to nazis, for example, which, you know, publicly using the swastika, which wasn't really something I was all that fond of. But I, I'm defenseless against that kind of female insanity because the techniques that I would use against a man who was employing those tactics are forbidden to me. So I don't know. Like it seems to me that it isn't men that have to stand up and say enough of this, even though that is what they should do. It seems to me that it's same women who have to stand up against their crazy sisters and say, look, enough of that enough man hating enough pathology, enough bringing disgrace on us as a, as a gender, but the problem there and then they'll stop my little tirade is that most of the women I know who are saying are busy doing saying things right. They're all, they have their career, they have their family, they're quite occupied and they don't seem to have the time or maybe even the interest to go after their, their crazy harpy sisters and so I don't see any regulating force for that, that terrible femininity and it seems to me to be invading the culture and undermining the masculine power of the culture in a way that's, I think fatal. I really do believe

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       I too. I too believe that these are symptomatic of the decline of western culture and, and, and it will just go down flat. I don't think people realize that, you know, masculinity is still exists. okay. In the world as a code among jihadist. Okay. And, and when you have Passionate masculinity, right? Circling the borders like the hawaiians and the vandals during the roman empire, that that's what I see. I see this culture rotting from within. Okay. And and does all link itself literally now my, I have an overview of why we're having these problems and if it comes from the fact that I'm the product of an immigrant family. All four of my grandparents and my mother were born in Italy, so I remember from my earliest years in this factory town in upstate New York where the y, but my relatives came to work in the shoe factory.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       I can remember still okay. They, the life of the agrarian era. Okay. Which, which, which for most of human history or the agrarian era where there was the world of men and the world of women and they sex has had very little to do with each other. Each had power and status and its own realm. Right? And they. And they laughed at each other in. In essence, the way the women had enormous power. In Fact, the old women ruled not the young beautiful woman like today, but the, the older you were, the more you had control over our everyone, including the mating and marriage. Um, you know, there were no doctors so that you had the, the old women were like midwives and knew all the ins and outs of this and inherited knowledge about pregnancy and all these other things. Right? I can remember this.

Speaker 3:          00:41:45       And, and the joy that women had with each other all day long. Okay. Cooking with each other, you know, a companions to each other. Talking, conversing. My mother remembered as a small child in Italy when it was time to do the laundry, they would take the laundry up the mountain, up the hill to the fountain you'll ago. Okay. And, and do it by hand. They would sing, they would pick nick and so on. Right? And we get a glimpse of that in the odyssey when odysseus is, is, is thrown up naked on the shores of asia and, and he hears the sound of women, young women laughing and singing. And it's nausicaa the princess bringing the women to do the laundry where he's exactly the same thing. Right? so there was a, each, each gender had its own hierarchy, its own values, own way of talking. And the sexist rarely intersected.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       Like I can remember in my childhood on a holiday. TypiCal, it could be christmas, it could be a thanksgiving, whatever. All the women would be cooking all day long. Everyone would sit down to eat. Okay. And then after that, okay. The women who retire unmasked to the kitchen and the men would go, I would, I would look at the window and see all the men. The men would be all outside, usually gather around the car. Okay. Then a time when cars didn't work as well as they do today with the hood up. Okay. And the men would be standing with their hands on their hips like that. Everyone's staring at the engine. And I went, yeah. That's how I learned. Okay. Men where we refreshing themselves by studying something technical and mechanical after being with women. Okay. You know, for during the dinner. Okay. And so, so, so all of these problems of today are the direCt consequence of women's emancipation and freedom from housework, thanks to capitalism, okay?

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       Which made it possible for women to have jobs outside the home for the very first time in the 19th century, no longer to be dependent on a husband or father or brother, right? And so this great, great thing that's happened to us, allowing us to be totally self supporting independent agents has produced all this animosity about making too many men and women because the women, women feel unhappy. Women Today, wherever I go, whether it's Italy or Brazil or england or America or toronto, okay? The, the, the, the upper middle class professional women are unhappy, miserable they want and they don't know what, why they're unhappy. They want to blame it on men. The men must change. Men must become more like women know that is the wrong way to go. Okay? It's when men are men and understand themselves as men are secure as men, then you are going to be happier.

Speaker 3:          00:44:14       Well, there's nothing more dangerous than a weak man. Absolutely. Okay. And especially all these quislings okay. Spouting feminist rhetoric, I hear that. Okay. I mean it makes me sick, but here's the point. Men and women have never worked side by side ever. Maybe under farms. okay. When you were like maybe one person in the potato fields, the other ones over here in the. During the tOmatoes or whatever. Okay. You, you, you, you had, you had familieS working, working side by side, exhaust with each other. no time to have it in any of this. It was a collaborative effort on, on forums and so on. Never in all of human history have men and women been working side by side and women are now the pressure about silicon valley. There are also sexist. They don't allow women in and so on. The men are being men in silicOn valley and the women, the engineers and the women are demanding that, oh, this is terrible.

Speaker 3:          00:45:03       You're being say maybe the sexes. Okay. HAve their own particular form of rhetoric. Their own particular form of identity. Okay. Maybe. Okay. We need to re, re, re, re examine. Okay. This business about your, the mic. Maybe we have to perhaps except some degree of tension and conflict between the sexes. Okay. In a work environment, I don't mean harassment. I'm sorry. I'm talking about women feeling disrespected now. Somehow they their opinions when they express them. Okay. Are not taken seriously or or the. Or even hillary clinton is complaining. Oh, when a woman writes something online, she's attacked immediately so. Well, everyone's attacked online. What are you talking about? The world is tough. The world is competitive. Okay. Identity is hold. Okay. By conflict, the idea that there should be no conflict, that we have to be in this bath at probation and you know, we just, we just devour it. That's

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       right. It's absolutely infant title in a minute. Okay, so a couple of things there. Well, the first thing is, is that the, the agreeableness trait that divides men and women most. There's three things that divide women and men most particularly from the psychometric perspective. One is that women are more agreeable than men, and so that seems to be the primary maternal dimension as far as I can tell them. It's associated with a desire to avoid conflict, but it's associated with interpersonal closeness, compassion, politeness. Women are reliably higher than men, especially in the scandinavian countries and in the countries where egalitarianism has progressed the farthest, so that's where the difference is. Maximize, which is one of the things james demore poInted out quite correctly and his infamous google memo, okay, women are hIgher in negative emotion, so that's anxiety and emotional pain, not that difference is approximately the same size and again that maximizes in egalitarian societies which is extremely interesting and then the biggest difference is the difference in interests between people and things and so women are more interested in people and men are more interested in things which goes along quite nicely with your car anecdote, but the thing about men interacting with men again, is that it isn't that they respect each other's viewpoints.

Speaker 2:          00:47:04       That's not exactly right. What happens with a man, and I know a lot of men that I would regard as as remarkably tough people for one reason or another and everything you do with them as a form of combat, like if you want your viewpoint taken seriously, often you have to yell them down and like they're not going to stop talking unless you start talking over them. You know, and it's not like manner automatically giving respect to other men because that just doesn't happen. Instead, the combat is there and it's expected and one of the problems, and so this is part of the reason why I think men are being out of so much of academia and and maybe the academic world in general and maybe the world in general, is that men actually don't have any idea how to compete with women. Because the problem is, is that if you unleash yourself completely, then you're an absolute bully.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       And there's no doubt about that. Because if men unleash themselves on other men, that can be pretty goddamn brutal. Especially for the men that are really tough. and so that just doesn't happen with women. But. So you can't unleash yourself completely if you, when you're a bully, if you lose while you're just bloody pathetic. So how the hell are you supposed to play a game like that, you know? So I've worked with lots of women in law firms in Canada for example, and and high achieving women, like really remarkable people I would say. And they're often nonplussed I would say by the attitude of the man in the law firm because they would like to see everyone pulling together because they're all part of the same team, whereas the manner like at each other's throats in an, in a cooperative way because they want the law firm to succeed, but they want to be the person who's at the top of the success hierarchy. Right? So, and that, that doesn't jive well with the more competitive or cooperative ethos. That's part and parcel of agreeableness. And so we don't really have any idea how to integrate male and female dominance.

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       Exactly. That's exactly right. This is why I love this show. Real housewives and I, which, which is scorings. And jusT say, just last night I was watching one episode right where the women were at each other. Okay. At a party and not in, in, in recounting, but I said this to you, but you said this to me and the men got. We got together there and said, well, this is the way they communicate with each other and innocent and that, you know, men, men, okay, just we'll have a fistfight and wheel him in 10 minutes later we're going to have a beer at the bar next to each other and so on. And I have observed that. My mind, my daughter,

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       my daughter used to be really irritated about that because she, she, like most people was the target of feminine, a conspiratorial bullying at one. She's no pushover. My daughter. so this wasn't like this was a continual thing or that she didn't know what to do about it, but she used to observe these girls conspiring against her and then black getting your name on on facebook, which is part of it, part and parcel of the typical female bullying routine, which is often reputation demolition, right? That there's a good literature on that. And Then she'd watched what would happen if my brother or my son would have a dispute with his friends, you know, and maybe they were drinking and there was a dispute they'd have a fight and then the next day they were friends again. And that's another thing that's strange is that men have a way of bringing a conflict to a head and resolving it right. And that it isn't obvious to me that Women have that same, perhaps you might call it a luxury, but it's also the case that men know what to do when they get into a conflict with a woman because what the hell are you supposed to do? You know, mostly what you're supposed to do is avoid it. And

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       well, I think um, you know, I don't know whether this crosses into other countries, but that there was a certain kind of taunting and teasing that men and boys do with each other that toughens them. Okay. And, and where they don't, they don't take things seriously. But a girl feelings become extremely hurt if you hear something like that. It goes very tough, you know, again, like sarcastic against her. so I mean, I do feel that there are profound differences between the sexes and in terms of emotions, in terms of communication patterns. I know my father used to say that he could never follow women's can conversations. He said he said women don't even finish the finish sentences that with the women understand immediately what the other woman is saying. Okay. Uh, and um, the way the women tend to be more interested in or haven't been traditionally more interested in soap operas, it's not just the women who were home without jobs is that I honestly, I believe that soap opera does reflect, does mirror the way women talk to each other.

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       There's these communication patterns and then built up through women, the world of women. Okay. Which was it made sense. There was a division of labor. Okay. It wasn't sexism against women that there was a division of labor. The men went off to hunt and did the dangerous thing. The women stayed around the heart because you had pregnant women, nursing women, older women. Okay. They were cooking and so on. So I feel that these communication patterns that we're talking about have been built up over the centuries and the men had to toughen each other. Okay. Do want to go out in the hunting part is a native americans, you know, it would be gone for two weeks and it was when the temperature was below zero and many of didn't die. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The idea that somehow in any kind of separation of the sexes are different spheres of the sexes is inherently sexist power dynamic.

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       The answer to all of this. Okay. Then everything that we're talking about. Okay. Is education into early history. Okay. And until you are, until people understand the stone age, but nomadic period, the agrarian era and ended up and how culture, how civilization built up. Okay. In mesopotamia, the great irrigation projects, or in orange Egypt where you head for the first centralized government authority became necessary. Okay. To master these needs and you had a situation where an environmentally, uh, you know, a difficult situation like the deserts of mesopotamia or, or the, the peculiar character of, of Egypt and geography where you can only have a little tiny, tiny, fertile line along the edges of denial. OkAy. Otherwise, desert landscape. So this civilization and authority. Okay. Right. I as not necessarily about power grabbing, but about organization to achieve something for the good of the people as a whole.

Speaker 2:          00:53:11       Well, that's exactly the symbolism of the great for reducing

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       hierarchy to, to power and selfish power. Okay. Is it is utterly naive. It's ignorant, right? So I say education to be totally reconstituted, including public education to be getting the most distant past it, so that. So our young people today who know nothing about how the, how the world was created that they inhabit, okay. Can understand, okay, what marvelous technological paradise they live in. And it's the product of capitalism as the productive of individual innovation is the most of, is the project will have a western tradition that everyone wants to trash now is there, if you be getting the past and show it also talk about war because the war is the one thing that wakes people up. Okay. As we see wars, wars, the reality principle, my father and all five of my uncles went to world war two. My father was part of the force that I landed in Japan. Okay. Uh, as a paratrooper, um, you know, at the time of the japanese surrender and, and a couple uncles got shot up and so on, when you have the reality of war, when people see the reality of the horrors of war, berlin burned to a crisp and, and so on. Starvation. Okay? Then you understand, okay, there's a marvelous mechanism that brings water, you know, to, to the, to the kitchen. And when you flip on a light looked lately, electric, electricity.

Speaker 2:          00:54:35       No. For me, like I suppose it's because I have somewhat of a depressive temperament. I mean, one Thing that staggers me on a consistent basis is the fact that anything ever works. I mean because it's so unlikely you know, to, to, to be in a situation where our electronic communications work, where our, where our electric grid works and it works all the time, right? It works a hundred percent of the time and the reason for that is that there are mostly men out there who are breaking themselves into pieces repairing this thing which just falls apart all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       I said this in the month debate, okay? In toronto several years ago, I said that there's the invisible at all these, these, you know, these elitist professors, sneering at men. It's men who are maintaining everything around us and anything is an invisible army. Which feminist don't notice. Nothing would work

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       or regarded regarded as impressive, which was, you know, like a professor is someone who's standing on a hill surrounded by a wall which is surrounded by another wall which is surrounded by another wall. Like it's walls all the way down. Who stands uP there and says, I am brave and independent. It's like you've got this protected area that's so unlikely. It's so absolutely unlikely, and the fact that people aren't on their knees in gratitude all the time for the fact that we have central heating and air conditioning and and pure water and reliable food, it's just, it's so. It is. It's absolutely unbelievable and

Speaker 3:          00:55:58       people used to die for then the water supply was contaminated with cholera for heaven's sakes, right? People don't understand, okay. That kept clean water, fresh milk, fresh orange juice, all of these things, these mro, nolan at the time, all the time, if that western culture is heading, become because we are so dependent on this invisible infrastructure where a heading for an absolute catastrophe when hottest, figure out how to paralyze the power grid, the entire culture will be be chaotic. You'll have mobs in the street. Okay, and within three days. Okay, wIndow. So suddenly the food supply is interrupted and there's no light. There's no, no way to communicate. There'll be like a robert. I mean that. That is the way western culture is going to collapse. Okay? And it won't take much because we are so interconnected and now we are so it's so. It's so dependent on communications and computers to the the I've, I've, I used to predict for years there'll be an asteroid hitting there enough another

Speaker 2:          00:56:56       the solar flares work. So back in. This happens about once every century, so back about 18, 80, and I don't remember the exact year. There was a significant enough solar flare, so that produces a electromagnetic pulse, like a hydrogen bomb because the sun is a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic pulse will emerge from the sun and wave across the earth and it produces huge spikes in electrical electrical curd along anything that's electronic and it'll burn them out. It led it lid telegraph operators on fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those things took out the quebec power grid in 1985 and knocked out the whole northeast corridor. And so they figure those things are about one in new century event. But those single. I have my brother in law who's a very smart guy. He designed the chip and the iphone. We were talking about political issues the last time I went and saw him in san francisco and his notion was that all that the government should be doing right now is stress testing our infrastructure the same way they stress test the banks because we're so full of these single points of failure that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       And I think you're absolutely right. Luckily we've been, um, what would you call, invaded by stupid terrorists instead of smart terrorists because it's a smart terrorists could do an unbelievable amount of damage in a very short period of time. So when it's just god's good graces that, that hasn't happened yet. And so,

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       and then what will happen is that if the men, okay, the men will reconstruct civilization while the women cower in the houses and they have the men go out and do all the dirty work. That's what's going to happen again. only men will, will bring civilization back again.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       So what. Okay. So now a couple of things. So the, the universities, I mean I've proposed, although it's something that's probably beyond my power that what should happen is that the universities, the real content of the universities should be stolen back from the universities because they're not making use of their intellectual property and that something should be started online that would constitute a genuine university. The problem is the accreditation issue, but I don't think that's a solvable problem. But do you see like all these people who have these postmodern neil marxist agendas are completely embedded inside the unit

Speaker 3:          00:59:03       and the point is over the, over the last 25 years, I have received constant mail from people dropping out of the graduate school. So I and r or giving up altogether on any idea of being a college professor because what's happened is that the most talent than an independent thinking people have avoided in the school. So we are now who we have on the compliant. The survival. Okay. The people who are currently in the university and, and hiring their successors. Okay. Are male educated themselves. I mean, I, I went on the first letters I received and the early 19 nineties, I'll never forget it, it was from a woman who was now a painting houses in Missouri and said she had been part of the comparative literature or a graduate program at, uh, at, you know, at berkeley and that she finally had to drop out because she said every time she would express enthusiasm for what they were reading, the qa, the people looked at her as if she had somehow encouraging an offense in other, in other words, enthusiasm for art or new, the very things you need as a teacher in the classroom.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       Okay. We're being trained out

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       your undergrad. If you respect art and literature, that means that you implicitly accept a hierarchy of quality. Right. And not to, of course contradicts the fundamental tenants of the postmodern doctrine, which is that there are no hierarchies of quality. And you know, when you. You talked a little bit earlier about the, the idea that you referred again to the idea that everything is associated with power and that's, that's the thing that I can't. That's the thing that I can't help but associate with, with the kind of personality pathology, like you know from a psychometric perspective, the best predictors of longterm success in our society, our intelligence iq, which you can measure very accurately and trait conscientiousness, which actually is a real testament to the culture, right? Because what you hope is that the smart people who work hard are the people who advance it. Not.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       It isn't like they deserve it. Exactly. That isn't what I mean. It's that if the culture is harnessing the productive power of individuals properly, then it should differentially reward people who are smart and conscientious because they're going to do a bunch of really interesting work for the rest of us and that that's very well established. Finding it's, it's as good as any finding in the social sciences, but despite that and despite the fact that everything works, which is a god damn miracle of sorts, there is this consistent story that we live in a patriarchy, that it's only oppressive, that it's done nothing but oppressed women since the beginning of time, which is also something that just boggles my mind. You know, like I knew

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       that I have sacrificed for our women and children cleaner their lives. Okay. For thousands of years, you know that and yes, there's been brutality, but the battalion and the minority. Okay. Yes. This, this sick. The portrayal of human history is nothing but male oppression and female victim manage. Okay. This is a way to permanently ensure the infantilization of women.

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       Absolutely. Yes. Well, and you can even make the case from a purely logical perspective. So. So here's an interesting, here's an interesting thought. So most of the people who abuse their children were abused as children, but most of the people who were abused as children don't abuse their children. Right? So if you look at the population of abusers, they were all abused. So you can say abuse causes abuse, but that's, that's not a good idea because you have a specific sample there, right? It's not a sample. What happens is that abuse dampens out over the centuries. It doesn't propagate itself. And that's obvious because if there was, if, if the hypothesis of essential men, male tyranny was true, it would spread exponentially through the population. And like three generations and there wouldn't be an exception at all. And so what happens is even when there is a tilt towards tyranny, let's say in the family or even in the society that regresses back to something that's far more benign, very, very rapidly. You see this so

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       hit me when one of the biggest unexamined issues is the transition from the great extended family of old okay into the nuclear family. And I do feel that freud is the best analyst of the particular, particular kind of claustrophobic cell of, of the modern nuclear family. It could be the human being, it could be that human beings were never intended. Okay. It should be to be trapped in a house, just what their parents and their extended families. But you had your aunts and you know, in grandparents and cousins, all of whom helped form your identity. Okay. So what, what, what one's identity with one member of a community rather than in just like hot house environment. So I think a lot of current issues, including the sudden spate of transgender claims and so on, that a lot of these things are coming from, um, unstable of in cell.

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       It's a truly a prison cell of a nuclear family. Two parents perhaps cannot give all the knowledge of life okay to, to the young. And so I, I think there are all kinds of, of um, sexual issues, you know, in that are generated by. But with the psychology today is a, is now I would simply a matter of a practical matter and people come in, uh, you know, the psychologist in the United States deals with your, your present problem. Let's not go into the distant past, okay, let's just deal with our president problem which are, which obviously we have forms of communication we need to like fix this and then you'll be fine. As a consequence, there's a complete absence of any kind of analysis of your experiences as a child with your parents, with, with your siblings and so on. How that might relate to your current sexual identity issues, whether it's transgender, whether it's homosexuality, it has impact.

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       You cannot possibly ask you about any genesis of homosexuality today because that is automatically defined as homophobic. Well, excuse me, every single as an openly gay person myself, I every gay person I know. Okay. There is some story. There seems to be in childhood. Not only that, there's a string similarity of the storylines of all of my friends who are gay. There's the same pattern that had to do with blurred borderlines, be between a son and his mother and so on. I'm not blaming the mother. Okay. I'm not blaming the mother at all. Okay. What I. What I see as a dynamic going on the bourgeois house, so the nuclear family where you had sometimes a distant father. Okay. A father who was present but it but not really engaged, and a mother who, who, who, who, who, who made the. Her companion is some way off in the mother has great imagination and flare and they had a shared thing and I mean the idea that sexuality has nothing, whatever to do. Okay with your family. Life is not good.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       I grow. It's also completely well. That's another thing, and I got a lot of trouble in Canada for my opposition to bill [inaudible], which was a bill that had to do with transgender rights and I didn't really give a damn about the transgender right issue that had nothing to do with it. What bothered me was that there was an issue of Compelled speech because you were required by the ontario human rights commission to use the pronouns that of the person's choice. Right. Otherwise,

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       absolutely our wellbeing. That is absolutelY intolerable. You know, I, I have said, I said years ago, okay, that my book sexual persona, which was like a 700 page book, I said, that is the biggest sex change in history because I okay with my transgender issues all don't look to the magnificent construction of english. Okay. It was the english language. Okay. That I seized on the game, my identity and my power as a person. Right. And therefore any intrusion into english. Someone told me how to use english. that's great gift. Okay. To me, this is absolutely obscene and evil government to try to dictate to us how we're going to use this, this magnificent instrument of english. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       absolutely. And that was for me the breaking point because I believe well and I think that that's associated with the idea of the logos in the west, you know, because that's a deep mythological idea that the logos is the thing that brings order out of chaos through communicative speech and that that's tightly aligned with your soul. And I don't care if You're an atheist or a believer, it doesn't matter. It's still the right language and that no one has any right whatsoever under any circumstances to trespass against that. And so, but that's okay because that's law in Canada now and so, but okay. So now back to your. Let's see, you were making a point about mine.

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       I know we wouldn't grow so just because it's, it's interesting to look at these things from obviously from multiple perspectives, which is another thing the ideologues don't do, rIght? Because for them everything is one cause there's one. That's how you can tell when you're dealing with someone who's ideologically possessed is they make everything attributable to a single cause like power. So, but so one of the things that's happened with the nuclear family that's quite interesting too, is that parents are older and they and they have fewer children. So you could imagine that that hot house environment in some sense as being exaggerated for a bunch of reasons, one is, well your child is a lot more valuable to you if you're older and you only have one or two right, because you're not going to get another chance. That's first of all, you might've had some trouble having the child to begin with and you're not gonna get another chance.

Speaker 2:          01:08:03       so you've got all your eggs are in one basket, so to speak. And then of course children don't have the number of siblings they used to have. And one of the things that's really useful about having siblings is that they, you in your place, right? They, their primary socialization agents. And I mean, that can be brutal and that's reflected say in the story of cain and abel, you know, that that internal household dynamic with siblings can be, can really become murderous and that has to be kept under control. But I think the, the hothouse flower person who's, who's incapable of tolerating any jobs or any or any testing, any dominance hierarchy, testing of the sort that you said that men do, part of that's the consequence of being raised by older parents who have excess resources, who have no siblings because the child is then of course special and that specialness. Well there, there seems to be an inverse relationship between that specialness that's protected and the person's robustness and resilience. And so, and then that's caught into or not caught in too. That's, that's a uh, pandered to by the universities, which insist upon setting up a situation where no one is ever offended by anything, any of the time. And that's something I also can't understand it all because.

Speaker 3:          01:09:17       Let me just say that's a huge point you just made. Okay. Because it's the upper middle class of the professional class who posts paul and having the children. Okay. Because they go to law school, they go to medical school in India and they have the children after their settled. Okay. In the. In, in a drop. Okay. So they're the ones. Okay. What were injected this, this, this hypersensitive bourgeois id code in, into the universities. Now my, my parents were 20 when they married in 21 when they had me. My father was um, you know, uh, when I went to college on the gi bill getting out of, out of world war two. So when I was born my father was still in college and was sweeping floors and so on. I am the product of young parents and nature once actually young parents. Right. Because because pregnancy is, is, is quicker, it's safer.

Speaker 3:          01:10:06       Okay. On. And my parents had the energy. okay. To um, you know, this youthful energy that we can do spirit that came out of world war two and so on. I'm part of that. Then the, then the only other sibling was born 14 years later. My father, this point was a college professor, so she had completely different parents than than I did, so she, she has very excellent manners and so I. She's completely different. okay. All right. And I'll have all this like moving the energy of my parents were just a lot of other teams, but not today we have this situation. No, it's considered heresy to raise this issue that you have have young women are told, okay, there's one feature for you. You are a future leader. Okay. You must, you must move forward. Okay. Four years of college and it perhaps into the professional class.

Speaker 3:          01:10:50       All right, so it may be the women, young women's bodies are signaling that they want to be known. Others maybe. Maybe. Maybe there are signals coming from the body weight of maybe not wanting this, this, this, this system of education that was devised for men. Okay. This being funneled the long channel long. It's nepotism. Alright. So young women feel they don't know why they feel they had no sense of identity. If they, if they, if they want to marry and drop out of college and have have a baby, they will be treated as traitors to their class. What you are future leaders have a baby only working class women would do that. I find working class women. Okay. In general. Okay. Far more rounded as personalities. The way they express themselves forcefully. They have body language that takes up space. A man says something to them on the street.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       They're right back in their face and so on. It this, the bourgeois girls. Okay. Who are taught to. They're there because they are a special. Okay. We have to postpone actual life. okay. From for all these years, they see these, these other girls who are home who misjudged the fraternity parties setting. These are the girls who like rotten for parental protection and handholding on, on the, on the committee investigating what would run on their date and so on and so forth. So. So yes. I think that yoU have located. That's very interesting. The idea that the, these, these young girls who are so sensitive. Okay. In college, so I'm able to handle their sex life are the product of older parents because they went through the professional career track. Yes, and they are. They have not had the experience of the competitiveness, you know, end up in and teasing of other siblings and they don't know how to.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       Well also the thing about young parents is they don't care as much as older parents and not actually turns out to be better because what you really want for your children is minimum necessary intervention. Right. And the developmental literature is actually quite clear on this. So if you're at home with your child, what the best rule that you can play is to be there but not to be interacting with the child all the time. the child should be off doing whatever it is the children do, which generally is playing with other children, right. Without it being mediated. Also by screens and, and technology because that's how they formulate their identity and that's how they learned to play games with other people and the parent is supposed to be there as a recourse for the child when they go out a little bit farther than they can tolerate in the half to come back and get some security.

Speaker 2:          01:13:14       And so, but that isn't, that's especially not what happens. Two single children because they're basically raised as miniature adults. So when I wonder too, like how much of the antipathy towards these are dark musings and I would say how much of the antipathy towards man that's being generated by say college age women is a, a deep repugnance for the role that they've been designed. And a disappointment with the man for who, you know, like, you think of those carpathian um, or, or, or uh, uh, I can't remember the culture. The basic marit marital routine was to ride into the village and grab the bride and runaway with her on a horse. Right. It's like the like the motorcycle gang member who rips the too naive woman out of girl, out of the of family.

Speaker 3:          01:14:04       There used to be bribed, stealing. It was quite, quite, quite widespread.

Speaker 2:          01:14:08       Right? Well, so I kind of wonder if part of the reason that modern university age women aren't so art so angry is because that fundamental feminine role is actually being denied to them and they're. They're objecting to that at a really, really fundamental level. Like a level of, of primitive outrage at

Speaker 3:          01:14:26       what's happened is the chaos that my generation of the sixties be released through the sexual revolution. I went when I arrived in college in 1964, w, w the colleges were still acting in local parentis in place of a parent. So my dormitory, all women's dormitory, we women had to sign in at 11:00 at night. The men could run free the entire night. So it was my generation of women that rose up and said, give us the same freedom as men have and the colleges replied, no, I'm in the world is dangerous. you could be raped. We have to protect you against. Right? And what we said, okay, was give us the freedom to risk rape. Okay. The, so what that did, today's women don't understand. It's a freedom that you want. It's the same freedom that gay men have when they go and they pick up a stranger or someplace they know it's dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:15:15       They know they could end up beaten up or killed. Okay? But they find it hot. If you want freedom, if you want equality, okay, then you have to stop behaving like a man. And so what we did is we gave freedom to these young women for several generations, but my generation had been raised and a far more resilient and robust culture. Okay. We had the strength, okay. To know what we wanted and to fight for what we wanted. These young women have been raised in this protective terribly protected ways. Right? So I think in some strAnge thing, you know, the fashion that all of these demands for intrusion from these stalinist committees, sexual, you know, investigating dates and so on. It's a way to re institute, okay, the rules that my generation through out the window. And I. So I think these young women are desperate.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       Not only that, but I have spoken out very strongly in, you know, in a, in a piece I wrote for time magazine isn't my most recent book, the idea that the raising the drinking age in this country. Okay. From 18 to 21. Okay. It's had a direct result. Okay. In these, in these disasters of binge drinking fraternity parties because to la, let couch students the way we could go out at as freshman have a beer sit any protected adult environment, learn how to have discourse with the opposite sex in, in a safe environment. Right? And so on. And you and, and the. And not today. Okay. Because because of the stupid role that the young people can't even buy a drink in a bar until they're 21. We have these fraternity parties that are like the caveman era. Well, of course in, in this modern age disadvantages men, gay men want to hook up and men wanted to have sex.

Speaker 3:          01:16:53       Women don't understand what men want. Women, women I put out because they're hoping that maybe the men will continue to be interested in them. Okay. The man just wants to experience. Okay. That the hormones drive toward Jordan. To me, I, I've, I've theorized. Okay. That the, you know, the sex drive in men is intertwined with, with hunted pursuit. Okay. Yeah, I feel absolutely. This is what women don't understand. Okay. If it. And if women understood what I understand from my transgender perspective, right. These women on the streets. Okay. I'm you. I'm obviously, you know, but madonna and admirer and you know, and I, I support pornography and prostitution so I don't want what I'm about to say. The seem conservative and then it isn't. Okay. What I'm saying is the women on the street, young women who are, who are jogging, okay. With no bra on.

Speaker 3:          01:17:40       Okay. Short shorts and have and have any earbuds in their ears. Okay. Just jogging the long line because I saw these women do not understand the nature of the human mind. They do not understand the nature of psychosis. Okay. And this intertwining them, talking about the hunt, the hunter pursued things. They're triggering a hunter thing. Just what? What, what? What do what you have talked about in terms of the zebra heard. Okay. They are triggering the hunt game. A impulse in psychotic men. Okay. I have it here. There goes. I'm very appetizing and, and totally oblivious animal. Okay. Bouncing along here. Okay. Sorry. And we're, we're in a period now where psychosis is not understood at all. Okay. Then a young women who has had no exposure to movies like psycho. Okay. Was the, the, you know, the kind of rapists serial murder thing. So on the kind of strange dynamic that has to do with it with an assault on the mother and margo, you know, in, in the, in the, in the mind of the psychotic. But I think that is an incredible night. He became these young women are emerging and going to college and in this incredible environment of sec orgiastic sexual experience in fraternity houses. They're completely unprepared for it. And, and so you're getting all this outrage or feminist rhetoric has gotten more and more extreme in its portrayal of men is evil, but in fact what we have is a cast is a, is a chaos in the sexual realm because the girls have not been told anything real in terms of biological substrate.

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       There's full of lies about what constitutes consent to. Exactly. And it's become something that's essentially portrayed linguistically as a sequence of progressive contracts, which you know, is. It's. Well, I think, you know, I've thought for awhile that we're living in the delusional fantasy of a naive 13 year old girl that's basically sums up our culture and I look at all these sexual rules that permeate the, the, the academia and I think two things. The first thing I think As well, I know because I was an alcohol researcher for a long time and you know that fIfty percent of violent crimes are directly attributable to alcohol. So if you're a murdered, there's about a 50 percent chance that you're drunk and about a 50 percent chance that the person who kills you is drunk. And the alcohol is the only drug that we know that actually amplifies aggression.

Speaker 2:          01:20:00       It does that in laboratory situations. Plus it's a great disinhibitor, right? so what alcohol does is it, it doesn't make you to the future consequences of your actions because if you ask someone who's drunk about the consequences of something stupid, they can tell you what the consequences are, but it makes you not care. And it does that because it's technically an exile lytic, like, like, like barbiturates or benzodiazepines. and it also has a, as an activating a property for many people who drink. So it's, it's a stimulant and a and an anxiolytic at the same time in a very, very potent, very potent for both of them. And you know, we put young people together and douse them in alcohol, right at the binge drinking level. and then, which also interferes with memory consolidation, which of course makes things much more complex. And then we're surprised when there are sexual misadventures and you know, and then it's also attributed almost purely to the predatory element that's, that's, uh, part and parcel of masculinity.

Speaker 2:          01:20:57       But a true, a tremenDous amount of that is also naive and stupidity, you know, because we expect like eight to 18 year old guys, especially the ones that aren't, that haven't been successful with girls, which is like 85 percent of them because the successful men are a very small percentage of men. The 85 percent who haven't been successful with men or with women, they don't know what the hell they're doing it all right in part of the reason they're getting drunk is to garner up enough courage to actually make an advance. Because I think another thing that women don't understand, especially with regards to young men, is just exactly how petrifying a attractive woman who's of say, somewhat higher status actually is to a young guy in it. There's lots of guys that wrIte me constantly and people that I've worked with that are so terrified of women, they can't even talk to them. it's very, very common.

Speaker 3:          01:21:46       Well, I take a very firm position, which is that I want college administration so state totally out of the social lives of the students. If a crime is committed, it should be reported to the police. I've been writing now for 20, 25 years now. Right, but, but it's not the business of any college administration to take any notice of what the students say to each other, say to each other as well as do with each other. Okay. I want it to totally stop is fascism? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:22:12       The worst. I agree. While you're sitting, it's. I think it's fascism of the worst kind because it's an. It's a new kind of fascism, you know, it's, it's partly generated by legislation. So the like the title nine men memo that was written in 2011. I recently got a copy of that god damn thing. That was one polluting bit of legislation. That was. That memo basically told universities that unless they set up a parallel court system, they were going to be denied central funding. It is absolutely unbelievable.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       We had a ball and it will in the leftists are supporting list. I know, I know. That shows. There is no authentic campus. Leftism I'm sorry. It's a fraud. Okay. Let me think. The faculty should be fighting the administration. You're on this federal federal regulation of how we're supposed to behave on camp.

Speaker 2:          01:22:59       Well, how can you be so how can you be so naive and foolish to think that taking an organization like the university, which already has plenty to do and forcing it to become a pseudo legal system that parallels the legal system, could possibly be anything but utterly catastrophic. It would mean you have to know absolutely nothing about the legal system and about the tremendous period of evolution that produced what's actually a stellar system and an adversarial system that protects the rights of the accused and of the end of the victim and to replace that with an ad hoc bureaucracy that has pretty much essentially the same degree of power as the court system with absolutely none of the training and none of the guarantees and to get real cards.

Speaker 3:          01:23:45       That piece that I wrote about date rape, it was in january of 1991 a news day got the most controversial thing I ever wrote in my entire career. I attack the entire thing and I demanded the college has standing back and get out of the social lives of the students, so on and people. The reaction people tried to recall, they called the president of my university, tried to get me fired. You can believe in hysteria. Okay. Right. I can believe it. Yeah. It won't cost them anything and it. If anything that says to women, okay, but they should be responsible for their own choices is regarded as reactionary. Are they kidding me? Okay. This is such a big trail of authentic feminism in my view.

Speaker 2:          01:24:28       Well, it's the ultimate betrayal of authentic feminism because it's. It, it. It's an invitation of all the things that you might be paranoid about with regards to the patriarchy back into your life. Right? It's an insistence that the most intrusive part of the tie, ironical, king come and take control over the most intimate details of your life. Incredible. On the assumption is that that's going to make your life better rather than worse. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:24:53       Yeah, and not to mention this idea of, you know, this, the stages of verbal consent as if, as if your impulse is based in the body, have anything to do with words. So I mean that's the whole point is you know, you're allowed to abandon, okay. You know, that part of the brain that's so, and it traveled with words. I mean

Speaker 2:          01:25:13       actually a marker of, of lack of social ability to have to do that because if you're a sophisticated, it's not like if you're dancing with someone, it's not like you call out the moves, right? If you have to do that, well then you're, you're, you're, you're more worse than the neophyte, right? You're an awkward neophyte fight and anybody with any sense should get the hell away from you. And so if you're reduced to the point where you have to verbally negotiate every element of intimate interaction, then what a downer that eds. But uh, what I, what an unbelievably, what would you call it? Naive and pathological view of the manner in which human beings interact. There's no sophistication in that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:50       Well, what I'm worried about also in this age of social media, uh, I've noticed as a, as a teacher in the classroom, that the young people are so used to communicating now by cell phone. Okay. My iphone, that's, they're losing body language and facial expressions. Okay. Which I think is going to compound the problem with these dating, uh, encounters. Okay. Because the ability to read the human face and into, into, into read little tiny inflections of emotion was I think my generation got that from looking at great foreign films with, with our, with our long takes because you'd have jon morrow and catherine deneuve in like a potential romantic encounters and you could use to the tiniest little little inflections that, that signal communication or sexual readiness or, or irony or skepticism or distance or whatever. But the inability to read the other people's intentions. Okay. That I think this is going to be a disaster. I'm a guy, I just, I just noticed that, um, how year by year, okay. The students are becoming much more flat affect and they in themselves complained that they'll sit in the same room with someone and be texting to each other. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:27:00       Yup. Yeah. Well there's a, there's a piece of evidence to that supports that to some degree. So women with brothers are less likely to get raped. And the reason for that is that they've learned that nonverbal language deeply. Right. And they can, they can, they can spot the.

Speaker 3:          01:27:16       Okay. But I, I have noticed, okay. Uh, in my, in my career. Okay. That the women who have many brothers. Okay. Are very good. Okay. As administrators and as business people, because they don't take men seriously. Okay. They regard but they, they, they, they saw their brothers. They were brothers are jokes. Okay. But they know how to control men. Okay. While it, while they still like men. Okay. They admired man. Alright. So this is something that I have seen repeatedly

Speaker 2:          01:27:46       that would be also reflective of the problem of fewer and fewer siblings.

Speaker 3:          01:27:50       Yes, that's right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And I've noticed this in publishing. Okay. That's that the, um, the, the women who have this job, the job of publicist. Okay. And rise to the top is as manager of publicity. Okay. Their ability to take charge of men and, and, and they're humorous men that like the end of in and they have great relationships with men because they don't have the sense of resentment and in, in, in worry and anxiety and they don't see men as aggressors. Okay. Right. And I think it's another thing too, is that as feminism, um, you know, uh, moved into its presence in assistant videology. Okay. It has tended to denigrate motherhood as, as a lesser order of human experience. And, and to enshrine, of course abortion. I am 100 percent of abortion rights. I belonged to planned parenthood for years until I finally rejected it as a branch of the democratic party, my party and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:28:41       Um, but, but as motherhood became excluded, as, as feminism became obsessed. Okay. With the, with the, with a professional woman. Okay. I feel that the lessons are that mothers learn had been lost. Okay. Yeah. To to, to, to, to feminism, which is okay if, if, if the, the mothers who who bear boy children. Okay. Understand the fragility of men, the fragility and boys. They understand it. They don't, they don't seem to boys. And then as a menace they understand that the greatest strength of women. Okay. So there's this tenderness and connectedness between the, between the mother and the and the boy child. Okay. W when motherhood is part of the experience of, of women who are discussing gender. So what we have today is this, this does gender. The lg has risen up on campuses where we're all. None of the. None of the girls know the students have married.

Speaker 3:          01:29:33       None of them had children. Okay. And you have, you have women. Some of them have had children, but a lot of them are lesbians or like or like arguing or like professional women and so on. Okay. So there's this whole tenderness and forgiven. Forgiveness. Okay. And encouragement that women do to two boys. Okay. The fragility, they don't understand this hypersensitivity of boys. It's not understood. Okay. Instead button. Boys are seen as somehow a more privileged. Okay. And somehow, you know, their, their, their, their energy level is interpreted as aggression. Okay. Potential violence and so on. Okay. Alright. Uh, so I, I think that that is what we would do better. Okay. If we would have. I have proposed. Okay. That colleges should allow. The moment a woman is entered, it's entered. Okay. She has entrusted at college for life. Okay. And that she, that she should be free to leave.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       Okay. To have babies when she, when her body wants that babies, when it's healthy to have them and then return have heaven had the occasional course again build up credits and fathers. I mean you might be able to do it as as well and so on, to get married. Women, women with children into the classroom. The moment that happens and it's happened after world war ii. Okay. We've hit a lot of married guys in the classroom. Okay. And so on. Not yet. Not that many women experience of a married person with a family talking about gender, but most of them gender stuff will be laughed out of the room. Okay. If you had a real mother in there who would experienced childbirth and had had rate and it was raising boys and consumer, why do I think that that's also something that has led to this, this, this incredible art artificiality and uh, and hysteria. Okay. Feminist rhetoric.

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       There's, there's another strange element to that which is that on the one hand, the radical feminist types, the neo marxist postmodernists are, are very much opposed to the patriarchy, let's say. And that's, that unidimensional ideological represented

Speaker 3:          01:31:33       mean perhaps the word can be applied to republican rome and that's it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:31:37       Well, and then maybe it can be applied usefully to certain kinds of tyranny, but not to a society that's actually functional.

Speaker 3:          01:31:43       Victorian england one, arguably. Okay. But other than that, and to use the word patriarchy and that ended at a slapdash way. So feel emma tourists are absolutely, absolutely. You know, just shows people know nothing about history. Whatever have you ever had, had done no reading.

Speaker 2:          01:31:56       So. And so what confuses me about is that despite the fact that the patriarch is viewed as this essentially evil entity and that that's associated with the masculine energy that built this oppressive structure, the antithesis of that, which would actually be femininity as far as I can tell, which is tightly associated with care and with child rearing is also denigrated. So it's like the only proper role for women to adopt is a patriarchal role despite the fact that the patriarchy is something that's entirely corrupt. So the hypothesis seems to be that the patriarchy would be just fine if women ran it. So no changes. It's just that would just be a transformation of leadership and somehow that would, that would rectify the fundamental problem even though it's hypothetically supposed to be structural. Okay. So I'm going to close with something. So, you know, there are elements in my character that are optimistic.

Speaker 2:          01:32:52       You know, I've, I've looked, for example, I worked for the un committee and on the relationship between economic development, sustainability, and I found out a variety of things that were very optimistic. Like the fact that, you know, tom set out to have poverty between 2000 and 2015 worldwide and actually hit that by about 2010. Right? So we're in the period of the fastest transformation of the bottom strata of the world's population into something approximating middleclass that's ever occurred. And there's all these great technological innovations on the horizon and it looks to me like things could go extraordinarily well if we were careful, but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's me. I'm pessimistic because I also see that there's five or six things happening, all of which appear at the level of catastrophe that are all happening at the same time. And so one of the things that I'd like to ask you is like what do you see happening in the next 10 years in the, in the universities are in culture at large and I mean you just put forward a proposal for the universities for the treatment of women, which I think is very interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:33:53       One because women do have a different timeframe than men, but like what the hell is the proper way forward? I've been encouraging young men to tell the truth and to take responsibility and there's a huge market for that message, but, but I'm not convinced by any stretch of the imagination that it's enough. What like when you look forward and you try to be optimistic, what the hell do you see?

Speaker 3:          01:34:15       Well, and in the largest scale, um, I'm concerned about the future western culture because as a student of history, it looks too much to me like ancient rome. Okay. Which became overexpanded, uh, which became a, it was at the mercy of a bureaucratic, um, uh, the creep. Okay. And can you imagine one of yesterday, right? And in and roman identity eventually got blurred. Okay. In, in the incorporation of so many different cultures, which at first seemed like a healthy kind of multiculturalism, but eventually overexpand and simply collapse of its own way. But I, I, and I, so I am concerned what the weather western culture is in a rapid decline. I think it would be very easy because we are so interconnected and so overcomplex very easy, you know, to bring it to ruin. It would only take one major natural disaster, you know, to do that, but the university themselves, I mean, I think people are all of a sudden in the United States, much more attentive to issues of political correctness because of the riots at berkeley, which was the, you know, which was the capital of free speech.

Speaker 3:          01:35:26       I mean, the free speech movement happened in the spring before I entered college in 1964 to one of the great principles and inspirational stories of my entire life. Mario savio was an assertion of, of the, of the supremacy of free thought and free speech. These. Okay. I, uh, so I think that perhaps, you know, we might just have turned a corner, but it's going to take a very, very long time for the university to be reformed. I feel that the cafeteria menu, okay, of, of the university curriculum has to be abandoned. That we must return to historical, uh, courses that begin in the earliest period and this donation, antiquity, in order to give perspective, you know, to, to our, to our present an analysis of our president at culture. I want a 50 slash 50 to 75 percent of college administrators fired. Okay. And the money be transferred over to, um, to, to faculty into libraries, into, into instruction.

Speaker 3:          01:36:22       Okay. Um, I, I think that, um, you know, obviously the way things are being, people are being trained right now, including at the public school level. Okay. Is I think that I think the public school level has gone to hell. And when, when, when, when, when my mother came, you know, came to United States at age of six. They were, the old public school system was very strict and therefore she has an excellent education, you know, and um, you know, did got all a's in her, in her even though she started out in not speaking english, spoke without an accent, etc. Okay. So today this, this kind of feel good. The public school education, which is, which is a form of ideology in our nation right now. so it's all about the no bullying. Okay. And so, and not about anything seriously about no bullying. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       Yeah. So I mean, I can tell them in my own students, I mean I've been teaching for 46 years so I can tell them this slow degradation of public school education. Like I said, they have to the point now that the students have absolutely no sense of world geography of world history and they know absolutely nothing. They don't know anything about wars and the reality, the barbaric reality of most of human history. Okay. And what are triggers? What a fantastic culture we live in. And so now identity, identity politics itself has just got to stop. I mean it was important. Once again, I was a rebel against the wasps. Had gemini. Okay. New white anglo saxon, protestant gemini. In american culture it was, it was suffocating. I, I was raised in the 19 fifties when wasps controlled corporations and, and, and education and politics and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:37:57       And so identity politics was necessary once. Okay. How do we asserted gay rights? Okay. And was it was stonewall rebellion of 1969. We assert, we asserted okay. The women's rights with a, with the rebirth of second wave feminism in the late 19 sixties. Okay, but this endless, okay, preoccupation with with a a fragmented Identity, we must return to the authentic that needs six. His vision, which is about identity coming from consciousness which transcends gender, which transcends all these divisions of race and ethnicity. Okay. Consciousness itself. Okay. Right now there's no sense of that any longer and that's what the 19 sixties.

Speaker 2:          01:38:37       That is a complete abandonment of personal responsibility because that consciousness, I think symbolically and I got a lot of this from yoga and also for american government. I mean that's the great logos of the west, right? That's the transcendent principle, which is his respect for the primacy of individual consciousness and what goes along with that primarily isn't individual rights. Although that's built into it. I mean that's the reason we have individual rights is for respect for that, but the responsibility that comes along with being an individual instead of the member of some group, especially in victimized group, which is like the assure. I wrote an article with one of my students who had toured the mass grave sites and in the former yugoslavia, you know, and have been exposed to that sort of thing and one of the things that our research indicated was that the best predictor of genocide is a victimization on the part of the group that produces the genocide.

Speaker 2:          01:39:28       Right. A sense of an accelerated sense of victimization and then it's, well, we get them before they get us. So when everyone's being taught now that they're a victim and then no one seems to have any sense that, you know, that's part of the essential tragedy of being that life is suffering and that and that and that and that and that the world rests on a foundation of suffering. It's nothing to take personally and it's something to take responsibility for it instead of blaming and, and resentment and all of the things that have polluted our universities and our culture.

Speaker 3:          01:39:57       Well. And then they'll also the abandonment of the, um, of, of the cannon. Okay. The people you know, asserted that the canon was the product of bias. And again, the va, you know, have a, have a provincial elitists and so on, but in point of fact, as a student of history of the arts, okay, I can, I can assure people that the canon. Okay. Oh the overwhelmingly so is, is the result of what artists have determined. Okay, we, we, we, we say a work is important. It's canonical because artists following it. Okay. We're influenced by it and we have this beautiful cascading tradition of influence. All right? So that's another part of the philistinism okay. Of current education to, to, to believe that there are these external reasons. Okay. For, for the why a work last, why a work written 500 years ago or a thousand years ago has global relevance

Speaker 2:          01:40:51       as if it's some sort of political that's

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       based on power as if anybody could even manage that no matter how nefarious world. But also, you know, we read in the sixties you had the, had the idea, okay, there wasn't like a human human sensibility that transcendent individual nations and solid and that and that there was this like rubric for cosmic consciousness. Okay. This, this sense of the universe as a whole and just to see the human being in relationship to great eternal principles of life and death, mortality and so on. Whereas marxism is blind. Marxism is very narrow. All it sees as a society. Okay? It says nothing beyond society. It doesn't seem nature. Okay? Mean it's absolutely mad. Are you going to have a system being taught, okay, in universities, right? Which, which, which, which thinks that this tiny thing of society. Okay. Compared to the enormity and beauty of nature. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       It shouldn't take all of our, all of our, you know, absorb all of our energy and attention. So, I mean, I just think that there's like a parochialism and provincialism, uh, you know, and it, it, it, and now all kinds of, um, you know, systematized elitism in our current education. I just got to be rooted out and I want to return to basics. Great. Simplicity's and I have all these faculty members teaching their little tiny courses that have to, has to do with their own specialty. That's got to stop. And people, people can pursue whatever they want in their private research scholars. Okay. Certainly that's necessary, but they must teach in the core curriculum. Uh, and, and, and, and people must decide what is crucial for an educated person to know. I do want a multicultural. I do want a global curriculum like I want. I want all the cultures taught. Okay? Right. This is not the answer. Martin marxism, this neo marxism in the university's okay. Is simply, it's lazy. It's a lazy way to assert multiculturalism without actually doing the research and the study of other cultures. Okay. Alright, good. One to close on. We agreed on everything I knew. All right. Great.
