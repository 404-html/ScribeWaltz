Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Dr richard, higher studies the neural basis of human intelligence and cognition. He works with neuroimaging technologies to study individual differences in mental ability. He received his phd in psychology from the Johns Hopkins University in Nineteen 75 and has since held appointments in the intramural research program at the National Institute of Mental Health and the medical school at Brown University and the University of California at Irvine Irvine. He has served on the editorial board or three journals, neuro, image intelligence and psychiatry research. He also served as guest editor for a special issue on brain imaging research for the journal intelligence. He provides neuroscience consultation, do university research groups, corporations, foundations, and educational and legal professionals. He's a popular lecturer and has appeared in numerous media outlets in 2012. His research was featured on Nova science now and he received the distinguished contributor award for the International Society for intelligence research. In 2013. The teaching company invited Richard to create an 18 lecture course called the intelligent rate. So welcome to Dr Richard. Higher today and we're going to talk about the most controversy of all topics. I would say in social science, uh, strangely enough intelligence, so maybe we could start with a little bit of historical information. I would like to know how you got interested in Iq research or intelligence research, let's say. And, and, and so let's start with that and then we can start diving. Diving into the nitty gritty.

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       Well, really it started in graduate school at Hopkins when I really became most interested in personality research and I started out studying individual differences in personality, but just by happenstance, the year I started graduate school in Nineteen 71 was the year one of the professors there, Julian Stanley was study up mathematically precocious youth and I was one of the proctors at the very first challenge search for mathematically precocious kids. And I wrote my first couple of papers as book chapters in books that Stanley was editing about this project. And I saw these, these kids age 10, 11, 12 when we're scoring higher on sat math, then hopkins freshmen. And the question was how does this happen? Where does this come from? So now it's kind of my earliest interest and in graduate school, although I really completed my dissertation on personality, uh, I took my first job at the National Institute of Mental Health in the intramural research program in the laboratory and psychology and psychopathology, which at the time the lab director was David Rosenthal who had just finished the Denmark adoption studies of schizophrenia.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       Right. And here is where I learned about genetics. My office was next door to a fellow named Monte bucks bond who was doing it both for initial search, very interested in that. And so my, my early interest in, in, in individual differences slowly morphed into an interest in individual differences in intelligence and add nim age. They were just going through a transition from kind of a psychoanalytic, a orientation to a neuro science orientation and I was kind of caught up in that. And so that's the origin of my interest in the brain in technologies to make brain measurements and relate that to individual differences. Okay, great. Okay. Now you just wrote a book too, and the neuroscience of intelligence can be a university press. And so when did that come out? That came out really just about six months ago, so it came out I think in December of 2016, but they tell me for publishing reasons, they call it a 2017 publication.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       While I'm. Part of the reason I was so excited to talk to you is that are done a very large amount of research, especially not so much practical lab research, but investigation into the structure of intelligence and into its measurement. We designed back in [inaudible] 93 with a student of mine, Daniel Higgins. We designed, well, it was probably the first online battery purporting to measure the cognitive abilities associated with dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Right? So I had the highest order cognitive functions in the brain and we found, much to our chagrin I would say, and this was very painful discovery, that a lot of what we have been thinking about as potentially separable neuro-psychological functions were pretty easily collapsible, collapsible into good old general intelligence. You know, that killer is central factor that seems to cognitive abilities. And so it was quite a shock, especially because the neuro psychologists have the time and they still do this, uh, are, are, are as assiduous in investigators of the psychometric intelligence literature is they should be intent to underestimate the central power of that in that initial factor.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       So anyways, I'm really interested into intelligence research partly from a practical perspective too, because the industrial organizational psychology literature is crystal clear for complex jobs. The best predictor of longterm success is intelligence and it's a predictor that's probably

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       say imagine you give it an r of point four to point five, which is pretty decent. So let's say 25 percent of the variance, the next best predictor is conscientiousness and it's pushing it's limit at mopping up 10 percent of the variability in longterm performance. So Iq, it's a killer man. And if we, I make sure my students assess intelligence with everything they do and it always ends up being a major predictor of things that you wouldn't even expect. Like disgust sensitivity for example. So your disgust sensitivity is higher if you have a lower Iq,

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       the g factor is powerful. You just said something though that I want to just make a distinction about you. We're talking about the g factor and then you kind of called it Iq. This is very common in everyday language to talk about intelligence Iq in what we call the g factor as one thing and it really isn't. So an Iq score is a good estimate of the g factor also includes other aspects of intelligence and intelligence in itself, although as a broad term is only a part of the universe of mental abilities, so if you are very good at calculating on what day? January fifth was in the year, 15, 20. That's a mental ability that some people have. It doesn't mean you're smart, right? With autistic survived so often and that they're often but

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       sufficiently often they have these amazing calculus calculation abilities for example, that don't seem to be manifest in a spectacularly high overall intelligence. Well, so what do you. What do you want to tell us about? You want to start with the book and and walk us through it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Well, you know that's interesting because the book is kind of a culmination of things. I've learned mostly from my neuroimaging work on intelligence and it kind of came as a surprise, is the first book I've ever written. I'm now retired actually from academia, never wrote a book while I was in academia is writing journal papers, uh, but Cambridge University press called and they have this series of fundamentals of neuroscience and they wanted to include intelligence and I regarded that as a major step because intelligence research really has been relegated almost to a, the peripheral of mainstream psychology politically to say the least. Yeah. And you know, the switch happened overnight from being in the mainstream to being really peripheral in about 1969 before 1969. Uh, almost everyone who was interested in education was concerned about the achievement gaps and they felt universally that once you equalized educational opportunities, those achievement gaps would disappear.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       Yeah. That was the head start head start.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Yeah. Even before headstart, headstart came to head start, but even before headstart, there were all these demonstration projects. That was one of the miracle in Milwaukee. And there were all these things that showed that if you really intervened in early childhood education. Yep, which at that time was called compensatory education. The early childhood education term came much later, but this idea of compensatory education really took off and then in 1969, the harvard educational review asked one of the foremost educational psychologist, Arthur Jensen to write a review of the progress and this article in 1969 is become infamous. The opening sentence was essentially we've tried compensatory education and it has failed, and then he had 100 pages of detailed statistical analysis of why there were no. You couldn't demonstrate an increase in Iq score and any of these programs now headstart had had just begun. So headstart wasn't included.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       Yeah, but I, you know, I reviewed the literature on headstart to extensively and basically what happened was that the. So that was for those viewers who don't know, headstart was a nationwide attempt to, to add additional education to the lives of disadvantaged kids especially, you know, at the preschool level. And basically what happened was that they actually did show improvements in academic achievement initially. So in grade one and grade two, they were performing above their peers. But then the difference in improvement, the difference in performance started to decrease and then my grade grade five, grade six, that differences in disappeared completely, so there was no evidence whatsoever of that, of that either have a stable one time, longterm gain in cognitive ability or what people were really hoping was that if you intervene early enough you get something that would sort of, Paul would turn into a positive feedback loop and the gains would actually advance across time.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       And what ended up happening with the headstart research basically was the conclusion that it produced no cognitive improvements whatsoever. Although more kids who went through headstart, I'm graduated from high school, fewer than were delinquent, more of them, fewer of them became pregnant teenage in the teenage years and more of them went to colleges, but that seemed to be because they were better socialized not because they were in any way. It had been made smarter. So that was a really tremendous disappointment because it was a bipartisan attempt to come to grips with the fundamental issues that sort of beat deviled structural poverty in the United States. No one was happy about that outcome. I can tell you,

Speaker 2:          00:12:21       jetson published his article. He also said that since I cue increases seemed not to be coming from these intense environmental interventions, we should consider the possibility that these differences have a genetic component and that really began the incendiary descent of intelligent search to the periphery, to the reaction against that was universal. Um, because it implied inferiority. If you building teams for Icu,

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       it's also something that's universally hated, but on both sides of the political spectrum, because on the liberal end, you know, the idea fundamentally is this, that everybody's the same and that if you, if you distribute educational resources property than everyone can succeed. And so that didn't work out so well for liberals. And then on the conservative side, the idea is, well, if you could just get off your lazy ass and get a job, there is a job for you out there. And the truth of the matter is, you know, you can tell me what you think about this, but this was a statistic that just absolutely shocked and staggered me when I went through the Intel intelligence literature. So you know, it is illegal in the United States to induct anybody who has an Iq of less than 83 and the reason for that is you know that the American armed forces have been conducting intelligence research for like more than 100 years and that was partly because they needed a way of sorting people rapidly during times of military expansion during war time.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       But it was also because Iq tests and especially in the early part of the 20th century were used to identify, let's say the deserving poor who could really benefit from additional educational attainment and advancement and the unit and the military was hoping to identify people from lower class strata that can be streamed into say, officer training programs and so forth or, or even skills training programs to to move people from the underclass into at least the working class and maybe above. So they had a bloody stake in this man. They wanted to find people, they wanted to sort them properly and they wanted to do social good when they weren't just trying to win a war, let's say. Which often also is a social good. But what happened was that by, I don't remember when this legislation was introduced, but it wasn't, it was in the later part of the 20th century, but there are basic finding, was that by say the 19 eighties, they had determined that if you had an Iq of less than 83, there was not a damn thing that the unit that the army could do, the armed forces could do to transform you into someone who could do something that was more productive than nonproductive.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       And the terrible thing about that is that it's about 10 percent of the population. And so they look at a statistic like that and you think, oh my God, you've got this, this, this, this enterprise, this massive enterprise that's chronically hungry for people to write. It's always, they're always looking for people. They're really oriented towards taking people from the underclass and lower working class and pushing them up the societal strata and during war time there actually desperate to bring in recruits, period. And their conclusion is the 10 percent of the population can't be trained to do anything. Anything sufficiently useful to make them militarily operable. It's just, I just read that my jaw just dropped. It's like,

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       oh yeah. In the United States we have about 330 million people and because of the distribution, the relatively normal distribution of Iq scores, about 16 percent. Have I accuse of 85 or means they're not going to graduate school?

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       No. It means that from, from what I've read practically, it means the wonder this company has actually done a really. They have a nice Iq tents from the commercial perspective, you know, it's actually psychometrically valid and they've linked Iq levels to a job. Specifically the job categories.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       I know not a lot. I was going to say they're not only not going to graduate school, they're not going to find a a stable job that pays a livable wage.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       Yeah. Especially given that so many of the service jobs now require fair, high degree of computational savvy or a built. No, I'm not computation, but ability to interact with complex computational technology typical till ladder at a checkout market or or the till at a Mcdonald's because Mcdonald's is actually very complicated. Is often far beyond the ability of people who are on the low end of the intelligence distribution and they claimed, I think it was wonderlic, although it might know it might've been. It might've been hunt. That's his name. They. He's a ICU researcher. Is it earl haunts? I think possibly what he claimed that if you have an Iq of below 90 it, it's, it's difficult. It's difficult for you to read well enough to translate what you're reading into action, so you can't actually read instructions and follow them. You don't have that level of literacy.

Speaker 2:          00:17:29       Yeah. I was going to say that in, in the United States, this bottom 16 percent translates into 51 million people, including $13 million children who are in school. This is a very difficult problem now. I knew earl passed away when I knew him pretty well. He also would say that there is this, a cognitive segregation in society. This is a point that Charles Murray makes and they often ask, uh, you know, when's the last time you had someone over for dinner who wasn't a college Grad?

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Well, that was something that Marie and her starting wrote about in their book the bell curve, which really struck me because I read that book twice, unlike most of the people criticized it and you know, we're one of the things that they pointed out in there, it was, look, the typically a typical educated person thinks that someone isn't very bright if they have an Iq of 150. So how'd you at graduate level, Phd Level Research Institutions, right? Because 115, there's, there's as many people at 150 and above as there are at 85 and below. And so it's a minority of the population and that's the top 15 percent. And you know, that's, that's the dollar undergraduate, right? So people have. See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've dealt with people who had, I ranges in the low eighties and tried to find them jobs and tried to train them. And I have some real knowledge about the stunning gap between people at the low end of the ICU distribution in the high end. And it's, it's no bloody wonder. People hate Iq research and intelligence research because it reveals a set of seriously

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       a dismal

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       facts about the incredible range of ability among human beings.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Well, yes, this is true. And moreover I would add to this that people in universities, professors and graduate students have a hard time understanding what the, what everyday life is like. If you have an Iq of 84, 85 and we're making your way, you're living independently. You were making your way in the world five. It is a challenge. I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       just barely begins to describe it. I had a, I had a client who, he probably had an Iq of under 80 and nonverbal portion of it anyways, and um, he was indistinguishable and physical appearance from, from let's say, I hate to use the frame normal person, but there's nothing more that marked him out about particularly intellectually impaired, you know. And uh, I tried at one point, this was so, so telling to me, I got him an inch, a volunteer job, which by the way is very difficult. It's harder to get a volunteer job in a real job because you have to do police screening and all sorts of things and the selection process is just as extreme, but I eventually ended up getting a job at a bike store, bike slash bookstore, and at that place couldn't hold him once the subsidy program had expired and then I him a job at a charity and his job was to fold letters into three so that they can be put into envelopes.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Well, that sounds easy except that he also had a bit of a motor tremor and you know, it took me about 30 hours to train him to fold up a piece of paper with sufficient precision so that it can be put in an envelope rapidly so that the envelope wasn't so mangled that it would get stuck in the automatic sorting machine. And another is high performance demands on him too. He had to whip through those letters pretty quickly and then sometimes the letters would have a photograph appendant to them that was stapled on and they weren't always stapled on in the same place. So then he had to calculate how to fold the paper over the photograph without bending the photograph in precise third so that would still fit in the envelope. And then he had to separate the French letters from the English letters and associate them with the proper envelopes. And like that level of complexity just did him in it. Number one. So

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       let me say two things. One is I hope common sense and the other is pretty provocative. The common sense things. We had to be very careful when we have these discussions not to devalue the human dignity of people who are in the upper end of the distribution. And if there's one criticism that is fair is sometimes in these conversations it sounds like we're devaluing people at the lower end of the distribution and we have to be very careful that we don't do that. A human life has dignity and Iq is not the most important thing that defines human beings even

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       associated with wisdom. It's not necessarily associated with truth or with courage or with many virtues that that are how great your identity at all with being likable or on the psychometric psychometric relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness is zero. Right. I think we have to make that point. Yes, I agree. I agree. I'm trying to make the point about how difficult it is for people who are on the low end of the cognitive spectrum to survive in an increasingly complex, cognitively sophisticated environment. Right. Your obs are just disappearing.

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       Yes, absolutely. Now let's ask the question. Is there anything that could be done about that? Well, Western society has tried very hard with a number of environmental environmentally based interventions, early childhood education. By the way that you said the. The literature in organizational psychology is very clear. The literature is equally clear in educational psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       Oh yeah. Well, the relationship between Iq and learning is more powerful than the relationship

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       between Iq job performance, that that's right. Which is kind of common sense or matches are common sense, but you know, if you put a bunch of variables into a regression equation to predict academic achievement and you have all these school quality variables and teacher quality variables and cognitive variables of the students and what you find is that teacher variables and the quality of the school variables together barely account for 10 percent. I know, I know. It's terrible. It's terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       Talk to the guy who ran it, admissions at Harvard. I taught at Harvard for a while. His name was dean with law and he a really smart guy. I really liked the and you know, he was, let's say he was on the right side of the human race and he was really trying to figure out how to run the admissions policy at Harvard so that it did the best for everyone concerned. And he had run an interesting series of analysis that I don't believe he ever published. And one of them was um, well let's say you segregate the Harvard population into the relatively low Iq kids. So maybe they only have an Iq of 130, you know, and the relatively high Iq kids who were pushing up towards two, 160. So you are two competing hypotheses there. One would be that the lower Iq kids come to Harvard, this remarkable environment, and they and they, and, and they, they thrive because of the high educational quality so well that they close the gap between them and the one 60 kids.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       And that's just completely, completely wrong. What happens is you put both those groups, they're both very, very highly selected, but some, you know, in this sort of superman rage intellectually, what happens is the gap just gets bigger and bigger as they progress through university. And it's a dreaded example of that, uh, matthew principle that the economists talk about, which is no to those who have more will be given. And from those who have nothing, everything will be taken. It's very, very. It's no wonder people disliked this research. It's so, it's so anti egalitarianism and it's essential and it's essential structure.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       Well, what I wanted to make a second point that I said would be provocative if you want to do something about this. Uh, you know, we tried a bunch of interventions, earnest, well funded, long term interventions don't seem to work, but neuro science has been excluded from discussions about what to do about this. And I believe that neuroscience progress in neuroscience research has the potential to really dramatically increase the g factor. Well, that's an optimistic statement. So I'm sure looking forward to some support for that one. It's optimistic and reversal and you know, just as a thought experiment, and I can tell you why I believe this is possible. What will first, before I tell you the thought experiment, the reason I'm optimistic is that it is because of the high heritability of the g factor. That means your genes are involved. Gene's work through biology, even if the environment interacts with that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       But basically you have a neuro biological system. It's complex, but as you begin to understand it, you can tweak it. This is what all medicine is doing now. They're trying to understand the neural biology slash genetic basis of our health and our diseases. Why so they can fix it. When you go to the doctor, you're going because you were biology is broken and you love your biology fixed. Well, let's think about the brain now. No one conceptualized as low Iq as a disease and it's a little dangerous, but to the extent to which low Iq has the genetic input or genetic influence, that's the extent to which you might be able to to find out how that works, how that, what that system is, and then figure out how to tweak that system to increase Iq. It's not science fiction. I mean that's. That's a plausible sequence of events.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       What the problem is, it's a very complex sequence, but I also think it's a finite set of problems, not an infinite set of problems. So the physicists, physicists configure out what happened during the first nanoseconds of the big bang. We can certainly figure out what the neural biology of intellect and how to tweak it. So I think that's possible. So now let's, let's do a thought experiment. Let's imagine there's an icu pill and I mean that metaphorically not really appealing. You could take like putting a floor, but like having fluoridated water just kind of raises the dental health of everybody would be nice if we had that for Iq, but just to imagine what it would be like if we shifted the distribution of Iq 15 points into the high end so that now the average Iq, I understand how it was computed and norming and everything, but the point is that no one would have an Iq less than 100. Right. What would the world be like if everyone could reason sufficiently to get a reasonable job? Well, that's a good question. I mean, the, the, the uh, what would you call the perverse part of me as funny? I was just talking to one of my graduate students.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       We'd be looking at the determinants of male attractiveness by the personality of female viewers. Okay. Okay. And so what we found is that there are some personality effects. So I'm extroverted, enthusiastic women tend to rate men generally speaking as more attractive than introvert or introverted, less enthusiastic women. And um, and so, so there are some just straight personality effects, but the biggest effect by far we found list the proclivity of, of women in general to rape men as less attractive as the women's Iq increased. And so the other thing that we don't know is what price we pay for, for accelerated Iq from a, from a broader perspective, you know, because I know that there is some evidence, and you can tell me what you think about this because I know that there's reasonable evidence that the average Iq of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is about 15 points higher than the standard population, which is kind of makes it a thought experiment.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       It's an experiment, real life experiment. It's equivalent to the one that you laid out. But aszkenazy Jews also tend to suffer from a host of neurological diseases that seem to be associated with increased neuroplasticity. And so to me it's often, it's often hard to gain on one front without losing on another. You know, I mean that's the evolutionary conundrum obviously, but we call that the social justice theory. If you started one thing, you have to be bad and everything else that kind of balanced it out, probably speaking, you do pay a price for your, for your exceptionalism, you know that. That's true because, you know, the, uh, the Julian Stanley studies or the math coaches, kids essentially found not only were they smart, but they were more mature than their age peers. Better looking, they were color. They were physically more fit. I mean, it was kind of the anti social.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       I know that's terrible. Well, I mean it's just, that also might be true because one of the things that can interfere with Iq is poor health and poor nutritional quality and all of that. I mean, it doesn't look like it's that easy to increase Iq, but it looks like it's pretty easy to decrease it. Yeah. I, you know, I think that those, those things have to be pretty extreme. Yeah. They have an effect and those effects may not be permanent. Actually, some studies of deprivation of people who suffer suffered deprivation during the second world war that suggests that Lowe's really severe, uh, deprivations didn't have lasting effects on, you know, well, people were pretty tough, so I'm inclined to agree with that. So, so have you seen any animal experiment, experimental work that you regard as compelling that shows something like the transformation of, of animal cognition into our, into something that's, it's, it's, it's higher order that you regard as compelling? Not sure what you mean, but there are certainly animal that

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       shows you extract the g factor from cognitive tests given to various animals.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       Right? So what I was wondering is has there been any evidence that you regard as credible showing at that could be that that say so called animal g factor extracted in the same. We should tell our readers to. The way you extract the g factor, I'm going to say it very, very rapidly, is imagine you take a randomly set, randomly selected set of 200 questions that require abstraction of one form or another to solve. And then can

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       you give those 200 questions to 100 people? And you sum the scores and you rank order them. You get something that's roughly equivalent there to a g factor. It's roughly that. So just say it a little bit differently. Just forever is on the same page. If you think of all the different mental abilities and you devise a test for each one of them and you gave this test where a lot of people across the range of ability, what you'll find is the scores on all those tests are positively correlated with each other, suggesting that all tests have mental ability, have something in common that's a great name. This g factor, this general ability to reason and some individual tests have more Gillotti men, other individual tests and tests of abstract reasoning tend to be highly guy. He said to you, repeat the following numbers back to me.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       Three, seven, two, one, six, five. That's not a very highly loaded mental ability to be able to do that. But if I gave you a streamline that and said, repeat them to me backwards, that becomes a g loaded ability because the transformation. Well, the other thing to say about that too is that a positive relationship between that stems multiple assessments that you described is actually quite high. Right? That's the thing is that that general factor not only exists across domains of cognitive ability, but it tends to account for a substantial amount of the, have the ability in each of those domains, right? It's kind of like Regina is kind of like a black hole for intelligence research and everything keeps falling into it. So that's an interesting way to put it because now we have these, uh, junior association studies that are finding these bits of DNA that are related to either latent factor of intelligence, which is the g factor or two what they call educational attainment variable. So school attainment is so highly correlated with Iq and that is essentially the same thing. So we're really moving. When I was in graduate school, the question was, is there a genetic component to intelligence or not?

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       This kind of DNA analysis, trying to find bits of DNA that are going to be related to what we call a intelligence or Iq testing or, or, or the g factor, and they seem to exist. There seems to be hundreds of them. A tiny effect, uh, which will make the ultimate story are extremely complicated. But as I said before, I think it's a finite set of problems right at the end of that sequence of solving those problems. I think there's a good chance we'll know how to increase Iq and I think it's a good thing to be able to do that. You know, I had said publicly that more intelligence is better than less. Sometimes I get criticized because that implies that people with less intelligence aren't as worthwhile. That's why I want to be very careful that I don't believe that is more of the accurate way of thinking about it and in a narrow range of possibilities and opportunities. That's right. And in my view, my political biases there for governments have a moral responsibility to help those people. And, and, and, uh, a lot of government programs are, aren't going to do it because your job training requires a certain level of uh, and, and so

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       Iq clients, they used to go to the government agencies that were designed to help people find employment and you know, the typical response was, well just go home and type up your CV and distributed. It's like a, you're just like, can't use a computer. I can't type, I don't know what to CV is, it's like it's, it's a nonstarter and all three councils, right?

Speaker 2:          00:37:34       That's right. So in the United States there are 51 million people with iqs under 85 and there were about 43 million people living in poverty. Do you think those Venn diagrams intersect? Well, we should also be clear about that

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       because it is so politically suspect is that it's not like it's, it's, it's, it's self evident that people who have less cognitive capability are likely to end up poor because there a serious complex problems in life that beset them that they have a difficult time dealing with and they can't learn as quickly. And so the relationship between poverty and intelligence is self evident if you're willing to think it through for any length of time. It doesn't mean that everybody who's rich that is. It doesn't mean that everyone who is rich is smart and it doesn't mean that everyone who is poor is stupid, what it took to be blunt. But what it mean is that if you're intelligent, you're much more likely to become financially successful. And I think it was the Hertenstein Herrnstein and Murray. I think the calculations back in the bell curve that indicated that if you imagined that you could, you were a fairy godmother and you have your newborn grandchild in front of you and you can grant them three standard deviations above the mean in terms of wealth at birth. Or you can grant them three standard deviations above the mean in terms of Iq at birth. And then you wanted to determine which would work better for them by the time they were 40. And the answer to that was quite clear is that Iq trump's wealth, terrific. If it's related to predict a positive future.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       So that's why I'm so interested in the concept of increasing Iq or increasing the g factor, not just the Iq score, but really what Andre this reasoning ability. So you know, some people have tried to teach college students critical thinking. I think that's a good thing if you can think critically so much the better. Exactly. You know, and you know, it may sound to your listeners, I just want to take a moment out here. It may sound to your listeners like here are these two guys pontificating about what it's like to be smart, not so smart. I mean the point of this, the point of neuroscience research, all intelligence and what I hope to achieve by writing the book was to show that that the genetic aspects are not deterministic. It's the opposite. So probabilistic, so the extent to which something like intelligence is genetic in my view, is the extent to which we'll learn how to change it for the better.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Well that's definitely. Yeah, because people do tend to think about a biological factors as deterministic in that that's a mistake because they can be shifted. So. So

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       with regards to the animal study, so you know, you pointed out that you can, you can come up with an Iq like estimate for say a rat and have you seen anything that indicates I don't care how it's done through training or or or neurochemically or or or by promoting brain function in different ways. However you might do it. That's actually indicated to you that there is a way of biologically enhancing the general cognitive ability. Even have an animal has anything credible just by breeding mice in a maze faster than other mice. Together you get mice. It seemed to be able to learn how to run a maze faster, but that's work from the 19 eighties or review this in the book. There are some interesting technologies that have been developed where you can turn parts of a rat brain on and off at will and see what happens. This is not yet been applied as far as I know to learning, but interestingly there are human studies underway with things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:41:46       A trans cranial magnetic stimulation and electrical

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       ways to low voltage ways to stimulate parts of the brain. And there are some interesting experiments now being done with humans to see if you can improve learning or reasoning ability benefactor, I edit this journal, the following colleges, which is kind of a prime spot for intelligence researchers to publish on all aspects of intelligence and we're just starting to put together a special issue on human experiments to increase reasoning ability using these, these, uh, techniques of stimulating the brain. You've seen some positive things with regards to low level electrical stimulation because that's also been used. It's more, it's more anecdotal, but there's a bit of research being used to treat depression, for example. That's right. And I do cover in the book the studies that were published up until the time I wrote the book and caution people that they hadn't been replicated yet. Right, right, right. But we're on the way. I mean, this is, this is an evolving area that's going to be very exciting. I mean, if students are listening to this podcast and we're thinking about neuroscience or psychology,

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       this kind of experiment is, is, is really a new phase of intelligence research where you can do experiments on human beings that are completely ethical, um, and relatively non intrusive, uh, uh, and this is really going to change everything because it will shift

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       intelligence research firm, basically psychometric correlations past what neuro imaging has done, which, which really moved it away from just cycle metrics and then correlating psychometric scores with measurable aspects of the brain like coast metabolic function or the amount of gray matter or white matter or the number of white matter fibers. I mean, we're all these fabulous connections, right? Was this new thing I got in early on that things. But that phase is now moving into this new phase of actually stimulating the brain to improve learning and memory and reasoning and all the while doing it with neuroimaging. Right? See what happens and adding DNA to it. I mean, come on now. This is a great time. Great. Entering the research in this area, right? Right. Well, there's some optimism on the rise. I looked for a

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       because I've been very interested in improving human performance, measuring it and improving it and so I looked and and doing that also in conjunction with businesses because I like things to have a practical end and you know, I looked to find out what the research indicated with regards to improvement of intelligence and mostly what I found was not so much improvement as conservation is that if you exercise both aerobically and and with weightlifting, that that can help you maintain your fluid intelligence across for longer across your lifespan because it tends to decline rather precipitously as you age, which is one of the more dismal things that you also discovered with Iq research and starts to decline when you're in your early twenties and it's kind of a linear downhill all the way along. But exercise really helps

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       it's preservation, which is pretty important that my participation is a big deal man. But enhancement would be good, but you know this thing about an icu pill coming up with a way to manipulate your bio on the neurobiology of your brain regarding intellect. If there's a breakthrough in this, it will come either from Alzheimer's research, more hormonal aging research, trying to prevent the slow decline of your mental faculties as you age, especially fluid intelligence, right? Uh, or trying to reverse the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. These are neurochemical problems right now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       Tightly, tightly linked to, oh, this is another thing we can talk about because so, um, I know that there are certain biological markers that Iq is loosely associated with, so you know, it's fragmented. It predicts in a fragmentary matters. So I know that even something as simple as simple reaction time, how fast you can push a button when the light comes on is correlated with Iq, with fluid intelligence at about point two, and I'm having a bigger head is slightly correlated, especially when you correct for body size and so his brain mass and so is thickness of the Myelin Sheath. So an individual neurons. So there are these, there's these micro markers of. You might think about them as neurological integrity that seemed to predict Iq, but you've been doing neuroimaging and I'm not as up on that. I haven't looked at that for a couple of years, so what have the neuro imagers found about brain structure and function in relationship to intelligence that you think is compelling and interesting?

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       Glad you asked this because as I was finishing the manuscript for the book, literally

Speaker 3:          00:47:21       after I turned it in, I had to ask for it back because there was this very interesting study published by a group at Yale that has, that used a fairly sophisticated way to look at white matter connection,

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       functional structural white matter connections and functional connections in the brain. Um, and determining how one brain area is functionally or structuring structurally related to all other brain areas. And you can put up a map of, of a person's brain that shows from brain imaging, from MRI technology, how their brain is interconnected. This paper said these inner connections are so reliable within a person that they're like fingerprints and not only that, but the fingerprints can predict Iq,

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       the density of connections, density of interconnections or something like that. Or is there something more specific going on?

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       It can be the density of connections structurally. How much white matter connects this area to that area, you know, and there are certain brain areas where you have a lot of white matter coming in and a lot of white matter going out to other parts of the brain that are called hubs and there are nodes that have lesser connections and so it makes it certainly makes sense that being able to make measurements of brain activity would be related to things like intelligence. And

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       do you remember what some of the major hubs we're like, are they identifiable as also as neuroanatomical areas with specific? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       Countries definitely neuro, no anatomical areas and they're white, you might expect, but they. What was exciting to me is they mapped on to a, a, a model of brain intelligence relationships that I had developed with my colleague rex young and published in 2007 and it was called the parietal frontal integration theory of intelligence. And the idea is that the connections between the parietal lobe, which is here and the frontal area, are the key connections for intelligence.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       Tell us, tell us why you derive that particular theory. Because you know, people have suggested say alternatively that the seat of higher order intelligence is basically let's say the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or something like that. So why specifically the connection, the connection patterns between frontal and Parietal area was.

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       Well, this article in 2007 was a review article where we took every single imaging study we could find that included a measure of intelligence and there were 37 such studies at the time, including some I had done as early as 1988 and others had done with much larger samples and we just kinda qualitatively analyze the results to see what brain areas came up in common across these studies using different measures, different imaging techniques. And we found that there was not an that not all brain areas were equally distributed. They tended to be concentrated in the front and the parietal lobe, but also we found areas in the occipital lobe and the temporal lobe that were also related to intelligence. And so we developed this model that we talked about how information would be processed and how information would flow around this set of. I think there were 18 areas all hypothesize, scored high on intelligence tests would have some combination of these areas.

Speaker 2:          00:51:35       You didn't need all of them kind of working together, but some people would have this combination, some people will have that combination and if you can make measurements of about the way information was flowing around these areas with technology like there may be ground which shows changes in the brain millisecond by millisecond that you might be able to actually estimate Iq from Brighton images. Two Thousand and seven people were trying to do this with multiple regression equations that never really replicated. Independent replications didn't go very far because the sample sizes were relatively small and you have enormous individual differences, but these newer techniques, these mathematical techniques of calculating brain conductivity really seem to have advanced this whole thing. Dramatic. Was there a map between the nodes that were identified in this more recent research in the areas that you guys had identified with your overarching analysis?

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       Yes, to to the way, and I looked at the data. It seemed like there was considerable overlap and some of the authors who we did not know personally when they wrote their papers, noted that the findings were consistent with our model. Any hemispheric differences? We are, yes, there were. There were more on the left than on the right, but there were also areas on the right as well and these areas tend to be areas that are also related to a language and memory and attention. More fundamental cognitive processes of language, memory and attention seem to be the the, the architecture on which intelligence

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       you. Here's a question that I haven't been able to figure out because I've looked at the attention literature lot and the more I look at the attention literature, the more I find it difficult to distinguish it from the intelligence literature. I mean attention and intelligence seemed to be different things and we certainly use the words in common parlance as different, but I haven't really been able to like imagine you wanted to establish a battery of attention related tests that were independent of Ge loaded a cognitive abilities. I haven't seen anybody manage that and so do. Do you, what do you think the difference is between the capacity to pay attention, which also seems to be associated with conscientiousness by the way, which isn't associated with Iq, but I mean what's the relationship between intention, attention and intelligence as far as you're concerned,

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       so studies have been done where they take cognitive variables, elemental cognitive tasks is what they call them, the real basic things that cognitive psychologists like to study, like the study reasoning, and they all studied wanting in memory, but they don't want to address why some people learn faster than other people or why some people can remember more than other people. That's a cognitive psychologist study. They studied what's common to everybody, but if you look at these elemental cognitive tasks so you can extracted a Jew factor of cognition, which is highly correlated with a psychometric sure abilities more than attention. Memory aspects of memory are more correlated to the gene factor. A processing speed is correlated. Sure, and the tension is also correlated. So I kind of have this idea from being a parent watching my kids grow up, that people differ in their baseline of attention when they're not specifically paying attention.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       This might be called consciousness. So you know, you have two kids walking through a museum for an hour and you come out and you're saying the kid one. So why did you see? And you get a whole long thing and yes, the other kid. Well, why did you see there? And you'd get a much was rich explanation. Yeah. Of what I've always thought about that as a difference in resolution of worlds. Well, yeah, call what you will, but you know, there are these differences. And uh, you know, we have, we've actually studied consciousness with brain imaging, uh, with my friend Mike outlier who's an anesthesiologist. We did the first imaging studies where we brought normal volunteers in and Mike gave them a anesthetic drugs to knock them out completely. They underwent brain imaging and we had different levels of anesthesia. We were trying to see what part of the brain is the last part of the brain to turn off when you lose consciousness. And they're than

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       did you find anything that you can make sense out of from that? Because of course, that's obviously an extraordinarily interesting question. Immediately the collapse of these networks is

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       just the real expert on the whole series of papers that the mechanism of consciousness is still one of the Great Nobel prize winning.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's my interpretation of literature too. It's like, it, it, it's, it's such a mystery that it seems uncrackable in some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       Well, what was good about the imaging stuff? You could study this experimentally. Yep. You know, you could, you could put people into different levels of consciousness and burning them out at will and seeing what, how the brain reacted. So the Thalamus seems to be an important. A lot of people. And I found those connections, uh, and each anesthetic, there are categories of anesthetics and they weren't. They have different mechanisms of action in the brain, yet they all produce the same a consequence when you purchased this,

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       that's a very interesting thing to. So what does it, cortical thalamic loops will mean. There's a guy named, what's his name? God, it's close to that. I'm afraid to. I haven't gotten it right. He suggests that I'm one of the, one of the consequences of psychedelic drugs is to decrease the gating of the thalamic cortical circuitry and, and that that's one of the mechanisms whereby that expanded at least sense of consciousness emerges as a constantly, you know, as a, as a consequence of experimentation with this, with the psychedelic end of the pharmaceutical universe.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       Yeah. We have a section where I talk about consciousness studies and try to relate the concept that if you can turn consciousness off, you should be able to turn it on. No anesthesiologists do this at will eop even though they don't understand what they're doing. Right, right. You know, uh, they, they can't tell you why it works. But then can you use if, if anesthetic drugs had to dissociate the brain and creativity seems to be related to a dissociation of the frontal lobes can lower doses, very, very low doses of anesthetic drugs caused just enough dis inhibition to increase your creativity. And I don't think this experiment has ever been done.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       No. You see something similar in that sometimes reported with people who've developed frontal temporal dementia at. Exactly. Right. And that's, that's, that's a very strange phenomenon where as your brain deteriorates, your creativity increases because so much of brain function seems to be inhibitory.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       So I don't know if a comparable disease that produces increases in intelligence,

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       right? No, no, I've never heard of that. Oh yeah. The other thing that's been, so, you tell me what you think about this. I mean, I was curious for awhile about these companies like lumosity, because when we developed our original prefrontal tap tasks, they weren't tests. They were, they kind of had a game like element, you know, and we kind of thought, well maybe if you have people practice doing them, um, they would obviously get better at the specific task because that is what people do. But then if you had people practice a whole bunch of them, maybe they would get better at the whole, at the entirety of the tasks in a way that would generalize to other, to other measures like the Raven's progressive matrices, which is a good measure of fluid intelligence. But that never works, and of course the lumosity people claimed that they were able to produce enhancement in general intelligence, but by all appearances, appearances, that's been a. that's been a dismal failure as well. It's, it's, it's very strange in some sense that that general factor doesn't seem to be something that you can actually improve by practice. Not What the hell why? Why can't. I just don't get that. It doesn't make sense. But

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       here's something you don't know about me. I'll bet. But I am in the Guinness Book of Records to Gamers addition because of my study, my brain imaging study of Tetris and I did a brain imaging study of Tetris. I thought it was published in 1992. I really want to do a study of warning. I wanted to see what happened in the brain before and after your one something. And back in 1991 when I was doing this, nobody had personal computers. Nobody had ever heard of tattooist computer games were not what they are today. And I went to the egghead software store when they had software stores that had just opened and I was talking to the guys there about I needed something where I could study before and after they learned something relatively simple. Yep. They showed me this game, tetris. It had just come in. They just had opened the box.

Speaker 2:          01:01:52       They put it up on the computer there and I thought, boy, this is really perfect. It's simple to learn, but there's an enormous learning curve. And we. We brought in a college students, a small number of college students, and we showed them how to play tetris. They practice for a few minutes. We injected the radioactive glucose for positron emission tomography and we did a pet scan studies of them that very first day played tetris for 32 minutes. They've been practiced everyday. They had to come to my office because nobody had a pc at home. They came to my office five days a week for about four weeks. They practice until they got so good at Tetris. Game is moving faster. It's amazing how good people can get it. You couldn't even believe a human being could do. I've watched people do that sort of thing. It's just absolutely unbelievable how good they can get out of it and when they got really good, we scanned on the second time and we found that even though the game was faster, harder, when they had learned how to do it, they used less glucose metabolic rate.

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       Okay, so now I knew that research. I read that research. Now. What do you think about? The problem is, I can't remember where this research came from because I also read at approximately the same time studies that appeared to claim and I think this was reviewed by Al Conan Goldberg and his book on a on hemispheric specialization for regionalization and novelty respectively. That as you, when you first start to learn something novel, and I think this was demonstrated, for example, in people who are listening, they were Danish native speakers who are listening to Danish in reverse and they use very large part portions of their brain when they were listening to Davish and reverse, but if they were listening to Danish property spoken, they use very small specified parts of the brain that were located in the ladder or enough in the back part of the left hemisphere and there was another group of researchers who were demonstrating that as you learned, the degree of activation decreased and it shifted from the right to the left and it shifted from the front to the back and it got smaller and smaller. And is that associated with that decreased glucose utilization? Is that the same phenomena? I think it is

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       to show it. We had done one, one imaging study before this tetris study where we'll just correlated a glucose metabolic rate with scores on a test of abstract reasoning. The hygiene load tests. They had taken the test during the imaging, so we'll see what brain areas we're involved and we did find some brain areas, but the really interesting, surprising thing was the correlation between the scores and glucose metabolic rate was always negative other than they did on the test, the lower their glucose metabolic rate, and that was the first thing we had about this idea of brain efficiency that there's been a lot of research on that turns out to be a complicated thing because nothing about the brain is simple, right? But it

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       does seem to make perfect sense that expert skill is associated with doing more with less. It makes sense now, but I tell you, nobody predicted it. And look, I understand. All right, that's research that research stood out for me in a very, very, uh, you know, in a, in a very striking manner.

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       So this thing about that you raised about practicing on different kinds of tests because of the attractive things about tetricks is visual spacial planning ahead to pension. There are a lot of elemental cognitive tasks necessary. You know, it was fine motor control, really necessary to do well on tech person to run it really well. And so the Tetris company found my research some years later and asked if I'd be willing to try to replicate it with more modern imaging, which of course I was willing to do. So they funded this and um, we found now instead of pet scanning, we use functional Mri and structural Mri both. And we did find, we found with the pet scanning for areas where after a teenage girls with very limited gaming experience Tetris, their brain activity decreased. But we also found from the structural MRI that there were increases in gray matter. And the really interesting thing is the areas where there were increases in gray matter did not overlap at all with the areas that functionally decreased. It would have been a terrific story that strange things are always more complicated than you hope them to be. Not only that, but I can tell you that every time I did a brain imaging study, we always found the exact opposite of what we expected. That,

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       that sounds to me like, you know, you might actually be, be, uh, be operating as a real scientist. What does, I mean things are so damn complicated that it's really difficult to guess, right? To begin with.

Speaker 2:          01:07:16       Well, I went to one of my three laws based on one. Number one is no story about the brain is simple. One, number two is no one study is definitive and law number three is it takes a long time to sort out all the various studies to see what's consistent and what establishes a reliable way to have evidence.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       Let me put you on a different track momentarily and maybe this won't work but, but you know, I'm always curious about, uh, let's say the practical implications of scientific research both at a personal level, familiar level, social level, all of those things. You know. So I mean, one of the things that I'm planning to do in the near future is to launch a website where that will enable people to assess themselves with what we've developed a scale called the big five aspect scale that breaks the big five down into 10 aspects, each of which, which provides some additional high resolution and useful descriptions of personality. So you'll be able to go there and find out what your personality is like. You'd be able to compare yourself to other people who, you know, to find out where your similarities and differences are. But one of the things we've been thinking about doing as well is putting up on the same side or real Iq tests nicely validated, probably focusing on fluid intelligence because it's a little bit less linguistically complex to do so, but maybe measuring verbal intelligence and then showing people the strata of occupations in which they're likely to find maximal success.

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       Because you know from, for me, given that I know that, that people vary in their cognitive abilities tremendously and that that's actually an important determinant of their life outcome. It seems to me. So let's say someone tests out in an Iq of around 150, and so you can say, look, you know, you're pretty damn smart. You're, you're up above 85 percent of the general population. You could, you could probably do a pretty damn good job as an undergraduate in university if you're also disciplined, right? If you were conscientious, he hit the books harder. You're gonna, you're gonna come out in the top core tile of your class, assuming that you're not at a spectacularly successful, a spectacularly selective university, but you're going to have a much more difficult time as a master's student and phd level stuff is going to be. You're going to be pushing your luck to really master that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       But you know, you could be, here's a, here's a domain of, of, of, of, uh, what would you call it? Industrial organizational activity where you could really be in the top 10 percentile. You know, it's like. So if you have an Iq of 115, like you might make one bang up plumber and you could have a spectacularly successful career as a plumber. And maybe as a manager of other plumbers and all of that and you know, and I, I actually happened to be a real efficacy and of the trade, so I certainly don't think of that as something that's a, that's a low quality or low status occupation in the least. But we would, we would like to tell people, okay heres, heres, here's a, here's an intellectual domain that's probably too high for you to be successful without working insane hours to, to, to, to close the gap because you can do that within st work up to some, some limited degree.

Speaker 1:          01:10:31       But it seems to me that the logical thing to do at least in part is to give people a sense of what their advantages and limitations are and then say to them, okay, well given that here's a place that you could go where you could be optimally successful. And so, you know, that's Kinda my take from a policy perspective let's say. But like what have you thought about, you know, the massive diversity and intellectual ability. You mean what are the implications from a policy perspective as far as you're concerned or location or guidance is clearly one. I actually did some consulting and some research for a nonprofit group called the Johnson O'connor Foundation, which is a vocational testing. We're not that big on ge,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       but they have their own battery of tests. They bring someone in and do a full day of, of cognitive tests. And from that they give some advice about what kinds of professions match their cognitive strengths and weaknesses. And I actually did some brain imaging, uh, on their tests and it was very, very interesting stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       Um, because it's hard to do the psychometrics properly with regards to vocational guidance because we don't really know. We don't have a good handle on how to classify jobs into their various subtypes. Like John Holland has done some good work doing that, but, but there's so many jobs and it's hard to figure out, well, what makes two jobs the same or similar, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       No, I was at Hopkins when Holland was there in some of my friends were graduate students work for him. And I learned all about that vocational testing. That's very powerful. And as you know, it's, that's more of his, his scales have kind of morphed into more personality. White dementia. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       that's it. That's exactly the nexus that we want to play out. It's like, okay, because there is a reason. I know people have been mapping Holland Holland job categories onto the big five and we have a fair bit of success, you know, and we're hoping that the differentiation down to the 10 levels of personality will provide even more precision. But, but with more general policy let. Okay. So far, so reasonable vocational counseling.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       That's a good idea. When does it start? Does it start in junior high? Like do you do

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       the Europeans do and start to attract people into trades and, and, and higher education at that early age.

Speaker 2:          01:12:57       European seemed to have had great success with that. So it's certainly Germans in particular. Yeah. So reasonable to look at. But the problem in the United States, there were so many problems with the way we conceptualize education and the whole idea of tracking. I don't know how it is in Canada, but in the United States, this idea of tracking has a very negative valance. Do it, you know, segregating the smart kids into one, one a set of classes and the less smart kids in dollars and then there's remedial education and, and there's been a tendency, a strong tendency in the United States to feel that kids learn from each other. So you don't want homogeneous groups based on learning ability. Your want. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:50       It's so funny because people say that with regards to two, let's say academic achievement, but they play exactly the opposite. Stumped when it comes to such things as has childhood sports, you know, so if you look at football for example, it's like, well hey, let's segregate like abilities. Like you don't have the people who stumble around on the field, dropping the ball all the time, playing the top end quarterbacks and nobody thinks there's a problem with that. They don't say, well, everyone learns from everyone else in that situation. So to me it speaks more of a refusal to admit to the stark reality that there are massive cognitive differences between people. And to try to actually start to address that with some degree of seriousness and the serious should be something like, okay, well let's look at the bottom 15 percent of the population cognitively speaking.

Speaker 1:          01:14:37       It's like, what the hell can we do for those people that's going to be useful and you know, like the guy that I was telling you about, I was trying to think of some way that he could find a respectable and productive and relatively stable position in society that would be useful. And I thought there was a couple of things he could do. Like one of the things he could've done, I think he could have been encouraged, let's say, to, to collect trash in the downtown areas. Like he could have been assigned a city block and it could have been said to him, look, your job is to keep this damn city block clean. Here's the bag, here's the stick. You get up in the morning, you go do this. It's like it makes everybody's life more pleasant. It's a valuable contribution. It's something you could do with a certain degree of pride and it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       And there's a socially valuable end of it. Now what happens in Toronto is that people drive around these vacuum cleaner machines on sidewalks and pick up the scrap paper and all of that. That actually turns out to be a very cognitively demanding job because, well, you have to pay careful attention. You can't run over people. You have to have decent social skills. And you know, it's complicated. But it might be nice to see. But we were not mature enough to have a discussion like this as a society we might want to say is like, okay, well there's a group of people who aren't going to be able to compete in the, in the cognitive workplace. They're not going to do it. And there's actually lots of them and we're not going to say they're lazy and we're not going to say they're not looking for work. We're not going to say any of that. We're going to say, look, we need to find occupations that have public utility that aren't just make work projects that people have. That level of abstract capacity could actually perform. But I don't think we have the maturity to have that conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:16:31       We don't have the economics. And so I would go even a little to the left of you and I would say there's nothing wrong with make work programs, you know, to, to allow people. I mean, you have to work with dignity. So you heard that option, but you also have this interesting experiment being proposed of the minimum annual income.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       Yeah. Well that worries me because see if there's a couple of things about that when it concerns me because, you know, so we're having a conversation here where we're taking, um, differences in Iq seriously. But the problem with a guaranteed annual income issue, I think one of the problems, and I'm not denying its potential utility, it's something that I think that would have to be experimentally determined and all of that. And maybe it could replace a plethora of less efficient social welfare programs. But, you know, it isn't obvious to me. It's obvious to me that there's a substantial proportion of the population. And I would say it's probably five percent that would destroy themselves instantly if you gave them a guaranteed annual income and they would do it because they're very low in conscientiousness, for example, and very impulsive and like I've worked with many guys, often x cocaine addicts who were often not all that high on the end of the cognitive distribution, but very, very low in conscientiousness, high and impulsivity.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       And those guys were absolutely fine as long as they were flat broke. But man, I tell you as soon as they had money, they were done. It was like three days in the bar, cocaine binge face down in a ditch and then they were fine until they got money again. And so I don't. The problem with the garden teed annual income solution is that man does not live by bread alone, let's say. And that if you have money and you have things to do, then you have a life. But if you just have money, you don't have a life.

Speaker 2:          01:18:32       I'm looking at, you know, I have a very narrow lens on this. What do I know about the big social policies? And No, I don't know anything about that more than anybody else. I have opinions like everybody, but my narrow lens is through intelligence. Yep. I think more is better than. Less. More doesn't make you a better person, doesn't make you honest, doesn't make you likable, doesn't make your conscience does. It, doesn't solve the problems of the world. But if we can do something to increase intelligence, generally I think that would go in some measure toward alleviating a lot of these, these, uh, very complex problems. So I'm managing the homelessness problem. Some proportion of chronically homeless people have schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder. Nobody knows what the genes are or how they work, but it's pretty clear there's a genetic component. If you can find the genes, figure out what they do and come up with real good treatments. If chores for schizophrenia and possibly preventions for schizophrenia, that indirectly is going to help alleviate the homeless problem. Right? So I don't know what to do about the homeless, but if you can figure out what to do about schizophrenia, that's going to have some impact on that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       Yes. It's basically, yeah, we'll use your claim to some degree is that these more complex social problems should be into isolative or micro problems and that specific solution should be sought for them and now that certainly strikes

Speaker 2:          01:20:13       me as an appropriate approach because everybody is different. Not everyone's the same reason. No, no. Well that's for sure. That's for sure. Not everyone's poor for the same route, for the same reason, by any stretch of the imagination. That's right. Poverty is. Doesn't have one cause no, not nearly caused by lack of money either because that would be a much easier problem to solve unfortunately. It's not so simple. So the one thing that we're probably getting towards the end, the one thing I would like to leave your listeners with is really optimism. Not Dismal problems in perpetuity because the genetic approach, I think, and I'm kind of out, you know, I'm kind of out there on this. This is not a mainstream view, but I think the more something is genetic, the more lives we can change it and that's why we should study the genetics of intelligence.

Speaker 2:          01:21:07       That's why I hope genes have more to do with it, that environment, not, no, not yet because I want to do something nefarious with jeeps and I understand the history of this varies because I think in neuroscience there's, there's optimism and to guard against the negative aspects, the potential negative aspects of this. The only solution is to have public conversation about this and we get people to understand Iq, intelligence, g factor, these are not all the same things. They have different relationships to the data, the genetic data particularly. So we have to understand these things and once we have some sense of this and not paint people who believe in that there's a genetic component is as our, as our a priori racists or malevolent people. Um, I think we, we, we can come to a common understanding about how genes and environment interact and figure out how all that works and begin to think how in the year 20, 50, or 20, 60 are going to help them resolve, resolve some of these issues to practical benefit. Well that is a good place.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       We've had a very productive discussion. So I think that's probably a nice place to, to, to bring everything to a close. I'd been speaking with Dr Richard Hire who studies the neuro basis of human intelligence and cognition and who has recently released a new book called and real science of intelligence published by Cambridge University press. It's an academic book, but for people who are interested in a serious discussion of the relationship between biology and intelligence, then it's a good Goto Tome and, uh, it's, it's an extraordinarily important topic given the undeniable primacy of intelligence as the fundamental predictor of, of, of let's say, success in many, many domains in, in, across the human lifespan. So thank you very much for spending an hour or so with us today. And, uh, and with any luck, maybe we'll talk to you again in the future. I'd like to talk to you perhaps about consciousness at some point that might be entertaining.

Speaker 2:          01:23:25       Well, I've listened to. I've really enjoyed it. I appreciate the chance of family more than three sentences. Three sentences are related to your listeners. I just want to say one thing about the book. It is written for the lay public as well. That's a good thing to know. Cambridge wouldn't let me call it the neuroscience of intelligence called what every parent and student needs to know about the neuro science, but because they wanted to market it as a strictly academic God, but I. it's getting quite a bit of attention. Just a moment. Nonacademic.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       Excellent. Well, I'll, I'll make sure that I. I mentioned that in the description which I will. I'll post the link to the book probably on Amazon. That's usually the most straightforward thing and also point out that it is in fact written for people who aren't only specialists in the area.

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       That was good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey listen, thank you very much. I appreciate it. No problem. It's a pleasure talking with you too. Good to meet you.
