1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,590
So here's what,
here's another proposition.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,290
You can think about what we've been 
doing so far in some way.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
Okay,

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,373
you can think about what we've been 
doing so far in some way is trying to 

5
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,810
figure out what the world is made of and
to answer that,

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:24,644
we have to think about what do you mean 
by the world and what do you mean by 

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,730
Meda?
Because those,

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,890
when you're asking a fundamental 
question like that,

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,250
the terms in the question have to be 
specified with a high degree of accuracy

10
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:39,650
or you're just chasing.
You're just chasing ghosts around.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,750
So we could say,
well,

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,650
at one level of analysis,
one level of resolutions,

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,200
pretty obvious that the world,
the objective world,

14
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:49,034
whatever that is,
is made out of atoms and democracy has 

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,780
said that a long time ago in Greece,
right?

16
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,910
He was the first guy that came up with 
the atomic theory,

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,130
but he didn't say that the world was 
made out of atoms.

18
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:02,030
He said that it was made out of atoms 
and space and you think,

19
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:02,900
well that's,
you know,

20
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:03,500
obvious.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:03,981
It's like,
no,

22
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,521
no,
no,

23
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:07,640
no.
It's not that obvious because as soon as

24
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:11,240
you have fundamental particles and 
space,

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,373
you can array those particles in space 
and you can arrange them in patterned 

26
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:20,801
ways and the patterned ways are real to.
The patterns are real too,

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,070
so and without.
Without the space,

28
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:25,904
you can't do that.
So Adam's plus space gives rise to 

29
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,010
something else and really what it gives 
rise to as far as I can tell,

30
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,870
it's something very much like 
inflammation.

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,320
Now,
inflammation is a very complicated idea.

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,150
What information is,
but that's okay.

33
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,720
We won't go into that at the moment.
Do you think about music?

34
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:45,380
Right?
Music is like Adams of sound,

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,160
right?
Because they're,

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,620
they're discreet.
Quanta of sound,

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,740
essentially their raid out in patterns 
across time,

38
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,870
and obviously the pattern,
the music is not just the note,

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,910
it's the pattern across time.

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,743
Okay,
so what are the things we might say is 

41
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:01,844
that,
well,

42
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,130
there's Adams in their space and there's
patterns.

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,350
Okay,
so patterns.

44
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,080
Now,
one of the most fundamental patterns.

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,940
Okay,
so let's put it this way.

46
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,631
We're going to say,
well,

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,760
what's your problem?
How to live in the world?

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,450
What's the world?
Well,

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,553
roughly speaking,
the problem is how to live as an 

50
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:28,481
individual in society and nature.
It's something like that.

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,520
Okay,
so then we're going to say,

52
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,110
okay,
if that's the actual problem,

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,333
the first thing you have to do to solve 
that is to conceptualize society and 

54
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:42,950
nature and conceptualize the individual.
So you have to represent them somehow.

55
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,443
Okay,
so how should you represent society and 

56
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,534
nature and the individual?
And the answer to that is that's 

57
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,940
complicated.
It's not obvious.

58
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,410
Now we kinda know,
for example,

59
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,190
that one way of representing society is 
the dominance hierarchy.

60
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,523
You know,
that's not only a way of representing 

61
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,050
and it's a way of being in this society,
right?

62
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,053
To talk about the dominance hierarchy is
to represent it to be in a dominant 

63
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,200
turkeys,
to live it.

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,140
So we can take about a dominance 
hierarchy.

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,060
Society is more than a dominance 
hierarchy,

66
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:15,520
but you know,
that's not a bad first approximation.

67
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
And then we can think of the place in 
which those dominance hierarchies exist.

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,353
We might think,
well that's for lack of a better way of 

69
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,384
conceptualizing it's nature.
So it's complicated because he can't 

70
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:33,130
actually some these concepts up in 
single words as far as I can tell,

71
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
you have to use an array of words and an
array of images because the categories 

72
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,100
are so broad that you just can't sum 
them up in a single concept.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
Okay.
So you can sum them up with words and 

74
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:48,130
you can sum them up with images and you 
can sum them up with stories and,

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,800
and that's,
that's what we do as people.

76
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,730
So the quest.
No.

77
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,660
So we're going to say,
well,

78
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:55,180
is that a,
is that the fundamental question?

79
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,480
How to live as an individual in society 
and nature?

80
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,890
It's like,
well,

81
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,450
I don't know if it's the fundamental 
question,

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,150
but it's af fundamental question.
So fine.

83
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
We'll go with that.

84
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,480
I'll go back over this a little bit 
later,

85
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,390
but I'll,
I'll start with this story.

86
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Yeah.
Okay.

87
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,260
So go back to the birthplace of 
civilization.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,433
Then we're going to tell the variant of 
this story that was discovered in the 

89
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,794
late 18 hundreds.
It's a story about this God called Matt 

90
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,103
or Martech.
So here's the basic structure of the 

91
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,604
story.

92
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,880
You got to primordial gods.
Now the way that must have been Damien's

93
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,040
conceptualize the world is they kinda 
thought about it.

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,233
You know how if you're out on the field,
it's flat and he kind of looked at the 

95
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:57,730
world.
The world looks like a dome,

96
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,950
right?
That's the sky on a disk.

97
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,803
So that's the Mesopotamian world.
That's kind of the world as 

98
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,160
conceptualized by the people who wrote 
genesis as well.

99
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,620
It's a dome on a disk.
Okay?

100
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,230
So the disc is land and underneath the 
land is water.

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,520
Fresh water.
Why?

102
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,990
Well,
if you dig down in the land,

103
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,200
you hit freshwater.
And then underneath that is salt water.

104
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,280
And how do you know that?
Well,

105
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,114
you know,
if you go out to the edges of the land 

106
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:21,850
and you find an ocean,
it's salt water.

107
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,010
So that's the hypothesis.
Okay,

108
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:27,850
so now as far as the Mesopotamians were 
concerned,

109
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,360
the salt water in the fresh water were 
two gods.

110
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,210
Now what did they represent?
Well,

111
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,163
one of them was male and one of them was
female and the female one was the salt 

112
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,460
water.
The male one was the,

113
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,500
was the freshwater.
Okay?

114
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,180
So now they kind of conceptualize that 
as a kind of a formless chaos,

115
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,014
so you can kinda think of that water 
mixture as the chaos from which life 

116
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,940
emerged.
It's something like that,

117
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,043
but it's also the case and we should 
remember that w that life did merged 

118
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:00,080
from water and that without water you 
don't live.

119
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,914
So it's,
it's not,

120
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,560
it's not a stupid idea.
It's kind of low resolution idea.

121
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,050
So is this chaotic intermingling of salt
and freshwater.

122
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,123
So that's sort of the idea.
There's a chaos idea looking at the 

123
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,330
bottom of that.
And so that's APP suit and tie.

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,193
Matt,
now the Mesopotamians don't say much 

125
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:22,721
about absolute and I kinda think that I 
think maybe that's because at that point

126
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:28,130
society hadn't become so highly 
structured that and,

127
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,080
and long lasting that that is a great 
representation of it had been formed.

128
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,940
I don't think that happened until the 
Egyptians,

129
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,860
but I might be wrong about that.
But in any case,

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,130
the Mesopotamians don't say much about 
absolute.

131
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,770
So what happens is tire mats down there 
in the depths,

132
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,633
Sorta like the whale in Pinocchio fact.
Very much like the whale in Pinocchio 

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,193
and uh,
her husband and they're locked together 

134
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,284
in a sexual embrace.
And so part of the idea here is that 

135
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,250
while the Union of opposites is 
necessary before something new can arise

136
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,413
and that,
that union of opposites can be 

137
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:03,800
conceptualized in some way sexually,
you know,

138
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,634
using male and female,
because when male and female come 

139
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,244
together,
something new emerges out of that and 

140
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,020
that sort of ideas like the matrix,
you know,

141
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,570
the matrix of things,
that's the mother matter,

142
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,390
mother.
Things emerge out of a matrix.

143
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,980
So,
so anyways,

144
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,814
absent soon time at are down there in 
the depths and they're locked together 

145
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,840
in the sexual embrace and they produce 
offspring and lots of them.

146
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,883
So that's the initial world of the gods.
Now there's all sorts of gods they give 

147
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,260
rise to and we don't know a lot about 
them,

148
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,500
but I'm going to make some hypotheses 
about the gods because you might think,

149
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,450
well,
what the hell are gods anyways,

150
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,800
you know?
And so I,

151
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,763
I think about them as personalities,
their personalities and their 

152
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,240
archetypical personalities.
And so it's like,

153
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,160
well,
Venus for example,

154
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,980
is the god of love and I'll show you 
some pictures of Venus.

155
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,380
And so what does that mean exactly?
Well,

156
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,333
it's like a complex of things.
Venus is how you act when you're in 

157
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,024
love.
Venus is what people find sexually 

158
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,250
attractive in women.
Venus is the,

159
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,153
the possession that occurs when you're 
in love or when you're really attracted 

160
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,550
to someone.
It's all those things.

161
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,530
And so it's like a forest that can 
invade you.

162
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,270
It's a way of perceiving.

163
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,403
It's a superordinate instinct.
It's shared across not only human 

164
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,290
beings,
but birds and bees as we all know.

165
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,060
So it's this,
it's a transcendent property and it,

166
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,240
it can take personified forum because it
can inhabit you.

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,553
And so it's this thing that's sort of 
objective and subjective and it's also 

168
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,060
one of the fundamental elements of the 
world.

169
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,610
So you might say,
well there's Venus for example,

170
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,444
and there's areas that's Mars.
So that's a god of war and he's usually 

171
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,380
masculine and he's very aggressive and 
so.

172
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,214
Well,
he's like a,

173
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,350
he's like the personality of,
of a warrior like rage.

174
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,940
So,
so,

175
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,410
so I kind of think about the gods,
especially the more fundamental gods.

176
00:08:56,411 --> 00:09:01,140
There's something like primordial forces
and here's a leap and I don't know about

177
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:01,974
it,
but I think that it's a recapitulation 

178
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,270
in some sense of individual 
socialization.

179
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,550
So I think that what happens to begin 
with is that,

180
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,900
you know,
you're,

181
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,183
as you emerge as an individual,
you start out in a chaotic and 

182
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:21,840
uninformed manner and then these things 
come to life inside of you.

183
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,763
And those things are these fundamental 
motivational systems that we were 

184
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,674
talking about.
And so they're the first products of 

185
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,344
chaos.
And then those things have to get their 

186
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,471
act together.
Okay.

187
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,400
So like I said,
that's a leap and I haven't been able to

188
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,650
completely fill in the gaps there,
but in any case,

189
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,260
all these gods and goddesses get created
by time at an absolute right.

190
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,630
So then they're running around causing 
trouble.

191
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,240
The first God's,
they'd make a lot of racket.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,433
They're doing a lot of impulsive and 
crazy things and they make a lot of 

193
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,500
noise and they're not very cautious and 
they make a big mistake.

194
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,420
They kill app suit and then they live on
his body.

195
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,550
Now that's a weird one,
a,

196
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,181
and you think,
well,

197
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,260
okay,
what's going on there?

198
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,094
Well,
absolute is masculine and so the 

199
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:12,870
masculine thing seems to be associated 
in some way with God,

200
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,890
the father and the dominance hierarchy,
and so what does it mean if he's dead?

201
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,723
It means that all this chaotic activity 
that's disintegrated has killed the 

202
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,050
structure and so they're all now living 
on a corpse,

203
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,123
which is not a good thing,
and maybe they didn't know what they 

204
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,910
killed and so,
so imagine they're careless.

205
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:33,744
They're kind of clueless.
They don't know what the hell's going 

206
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,090
on,
and they break a bunch of rules and they

207
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,470
destroy the,
the,

208
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,753
the orderly element of what initially 
gave rise to them and then they live on 

209
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,180
it's corpse.
In.

210
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,600
Another way of thinking about that is 
that that's what you guys do.

211
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,840
You're living on a corpse.
You're living on the corpse of the past,

212
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,600
right?
And it's the consequence of the activity

213
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:55,500
of the dead and it's dead because it's 
the activity of the dead,

214
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,570
right?
I mean the library.

215
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,690
There's no life in a library except for 
the people in it.

216
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,670
The rest of it's all ghosts.

217
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,670
So you're living on the dead shell of 
the past.

218
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,540
Okay.
Anyways,

219
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,583
these guards are all making all sorts of
racket and running around and spinning 

220
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:14,800
up wind and dust and noise and it's 
really chaotic and then they kill Appsu.

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,631
It's like,
hmm,

222
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,750
that's not a good idea.
So absolute was also ordered.

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,320
And so what happens when you kill order?
When you destroy order,

224
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,920
what happens?
Up comes chaos.

225
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,810
That's what happened in Iraq for 
example.

226
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,060
Okay.
So time that comes up and she thinks,

227
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,230
I don't know about these things I 
created.

228
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:38,760
It's like they're really noisy and 
annoying and careless.

229
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,580
And uh,
they went and killed up suits.

230
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,650
He's like,
he's my current Saturdays necessary.

231
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,030
It's like,
not for them.

232
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,620
They're gone.
I'm going to wipe them out.

233
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,980
Sort of like God deciding to wipe out 
everybody with the flood.

234
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,323
It's the same idea.
These stories all came from the same 

235
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,710
area,
right?

236
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,710
So it's another representation of that 
idea.

237
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,110
It's also kind of have a vengeful God 
idea.

238
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,760
Now you might think,
well,

239
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,830
what about this vengeful God idea?
It's like,

240
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,664
well,
do you really want to have a god that's 

241
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:04,984
eventual?
It's like that's a stupid question 

242
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,470
because you've got one whether you want 
one or not.

243
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,340
So I can give you an example.
So let's think about New Orleans,

244
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,803
right?
So New Orleans got hit by a hurricane 

245
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,890
and it was a natural disaster and it 
wiped out a big chunk of the city,

246
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
right?
Well,

247
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,730
no,
that isn't really right.

248
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,710
So the Dutch live underwater basically,
right?

249
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,660
The whole bloody country is below sea 
level.

250
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,430
So the dots make these huge dams and 
they maintain them like Matt.

251
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,264
And here's the Dutch rule.
We're going to try to calculate the 

252
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:41,620
worst possible storm that could possibly
happen in 10,000

253
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,170
years,
and then we're going to build those damn

254
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:44,460
dikes.

255
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,720
So if that storm comes,
we're safe.

256
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,730
Okay.
So what happens?

257
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,420
Holland isn't underwater,
so there's no natural disaster.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,220
So let's go to New Orleans.
It's like,

259
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,960
well,
why did Orleans get wiped out?

260
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,490
Well,
there was a hurricane.

261
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,353
It's like,
did they know that there might be 

262
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,450
hurricanes?
Yes.

263
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,670
Did they know that?
The dikes weren't big enough.

264
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,593
Yes.
Have they been complaining about it for 

265
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,630
a hundred years?
Yes.

266
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,530
Have there been things put in place to 
try to get the dikes better?

267
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,120
Yes.
Did that work?

268
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,220
No.
Why not?

269
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,240
Because it's corrupt.
It's a corrupt state now.

270
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,074
All the money,
they pour it in there too to help the 

271
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,770
people after the.
After the flood.

272
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,660
That didn't help them.
It just disappeared.

273
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,494
And so you can't.
If the state is corrupt and the 

274
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:32,440
individuals within it or corrupt,
it means the structure.

275
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,540
The society is dead.
It's a corpse.

276
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,390
And what happens when you make a corpse 
out of your society?

277
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,070
A corrupt corpse.
Wow.

278
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:39,904
That's easy.
Mother Nature comes back and takes what 

279
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,050
she has and then you think,
oh,

280
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,820
isn't the world a terrible place?
It's like,

281
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,530
yeah,
try not frittering away the money.

282
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,030
See what happens.

283
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,000
It's part of it.
Yeah.

284
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,493
It's part of it.
So there's a whole tangled up idea of 

285
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,540
murderers and so forth.
We'll get into that.

286
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,530
So anyways.
Okay,

287
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,000
so ty mass had it.
She said,

288
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,790
wow,
these things aren't worth preserving.

289
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,783
I'm going to go and wipe them out and 
then everything will be nice and calm 

290
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,580
and peaceful yet.
And so the gods,

291
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,830
they get wind of this,
you know,

292
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,651
and they're thinking,
Hey,

293
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,480
this isn't very good because like,
she's,

294
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,273
that's time out.
We're talking about here she is mother 

295
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,540
nature,
like in that inner terrible sense.

296
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,940
And she creates everything and she kills
everything.

297
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,750
And if he decides that we're,
you know,

298
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,920
going back to where we came from,
that's probably what's going to happen.

299
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,630
So they're pretty blurry.
I'm worried about this.

300
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,200
So they get together in a kind of a 
council.

301
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,730
So they're trying to organize 
themselves,

302
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,920
say they get to get under under council 
and they think,

303
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,360
oh well what are we going to do about 
this?

304
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,583
And so they elect,
they take one of their gods and they 

305
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:43,511
say,
you,

306
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,810
why don't you go out there and try to,
you know,

307
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,450
keep time at,
at bay and straightened her out.

308
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,313
So one God goes out and has a big fight 
with tire Matt and comes back and he's 

309
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,970
old,
defeated and wiped out,

310
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,813
not work.
And so then they send another God out 

311
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,510
and he's just completely useless.
That doesn't work.

312
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:03,800
It comes back and it was getting pretty 
damn desperate.

313
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:08,300
They're in the realm of the original 
gods and so this is going on for quite a

314
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,134
long time and while this is happening,
the gods are still marrying each other 

315
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:12,944
and producing offspring and so forth.
And one day this new sort of go onto 

316
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,330
peers on the scenes and his name is 
Martin and Martin is.

317
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,283
He's a new thing.
They're not really sure what to do with 

318
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,690
them and he's got.

319
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
He can really hear and he can speak 
magic words.

320
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,560
And so when he says magic words,
the day appears in the night disappears.

321
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:34,010
And so he's got the power of speech,
that's a big deal.

322
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,720
And he's got eyes all the way around his
head.

323
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,910
You can see everywhere,
it can really pay attention.

324
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,373
So you know,
and he's big and he's strong and he's 

325
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:41,954
tough and all those things.
But the big things is he can speak and 

326
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,190
he can really seek and really pay 
attention.

327
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
So the gods think,
hmm,

328
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,353
well he's kind of a new character,
we haven't thrown anything like that at 

329
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,450
time matt yet,
so let's,

330
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,463
let's do it.
So they all get together in their 

331
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,130
counsel and they bring it in and they 
say,

332
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:58,521
well,
you know,

333
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,220
we're kind of thinking to be a good idea
if you went out and fought this terrible

334
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:02,054
monster,
right?

335
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,320
And he thinks,
well,

336
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,120
you think that's a good idea,
but you know,

337
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,510
it's me on the line here so I need a 
price.

338
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,580
And so the price is you make me the 
determiner of destiny's.

339
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,240
Now that's an interesting phrase.
Hey,

340
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,960
and we don't know exactly know what they
meant,

341
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:22,961
but it's something like what I am that's
Marduk is now going to be the thing that

342
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:28,550
determines how things unfold.
So it's sort of like,

343
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,470
I'm going to be taught God,
you may,

344
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:33,650
if I'm going off to fight time at,
I'm top God.

345
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,863
In fact,
that's how you can define top God 

346
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,600
taught.
God is the God that can go out and fight

347
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,460
tie imac.
So the other,

348
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,653
the other guards,
they're not very happy about having to 

349
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:43,514
subordinate themselves to Martin,
but they think beats the hell out of 

350
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,300
being eaten by ty amounts.
So they say,

351
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,500
yeah,
yeah,

352
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,290
if you,
when you get to be like top God,

353
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,270
you,
you have the tablets of destiny,

354
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,190
you can determine destiny fight fine.

355
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,320
So,
so fine.

356
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,154
Martin goes off and he gets his act 
together and it gets big net and he 

357
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:05,060
prepares himself and he rides forward 
and encounters time at.

358
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,950
She's this great big dragon like monster
thing that's her there on the,

359
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,323
on the right left.
So you can see she's kind of a dragon 

360
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,060
angel monster thing.
She's like,

361
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,923
she is a monster and what she is is 
really an amalgam of frightening things 

362
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,210
essentially.
So.

363
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,044
And there's Martech on the right and 
he's going to go give her a good 

364
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,714
whacking.
And so he goes out there and the first 

365
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,810
thing he does,
and this is quite cool,

366
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,973
he encapsulate her in a net now.
So think about that because she's 

367
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,660
basically natural chaos.
She's the productivity of natural chaos.

368
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,823
And so what mark does is it encapsulates
her in the net and that's like a 

369
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,880
conceptual scheme,
right?

370
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,713
He puts,
he puts boundaries around the chaos and 

371
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,020
that's what Margaret can do.
That's,

372
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,093
that's his ability with his ability to 
speak in his eyes and his capacity to 

373
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,400
pay attention.
So he,

374
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,960
he encloses her,
right?

375
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,300
And so that's kind of hard on her.
She can't get out of the net.

376
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,313
And then he cuts her into pieces and 
then he makes the world out of the 

377
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:01,674
pieces.
And in fact one of Martin's names is he 

378
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:08,740
who fashioned ingenious things out of 
the carcass of format,

379
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,840
which is so cool because it's a tool use
metaphor.

380
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,674
It's right.
How do you conquer nature while you go 

381
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,660
in there and you,
you know,

382
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,960
will decompose it in many ways and you 
make weapons out of it and you make cool

383
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:19,794
things and that keeps it at bay.
And how do you do that by speaking and 

384
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,090
paying attention.

385
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,250
So that's what the Mesopotamians figured
out.

386
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,084
Now they didn't know that that's what 
they figured out because like the idea 

387
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:31,494
was already there,
it was implicit in the dominance 

388
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,044
hierarchy in some sense,
but and they were observing the 

389
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,840
dominance hierarchy and well,
they got their kingdom together.

390
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,580
They were bringing tribes in from all 
over,

391
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,400
right?
And all the tribes had their stories and

392
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,234
then I'll know all those stories had to 
fight and so that's like the battle of 

393
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:49,614
gods in the battle of the gardens and 
having all those stories had to fight 

394
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,943
just like Islam and Christianity and 
Catholicism and protestantism or all 

395
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,130
scrapping for dominance.
Now they're fighting.

396
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,700
How do we make sense out of this mess?
Maybe take several thousand years,

397
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,483
Mesopotamia gathered together all of 
these tribes and their stories and then 

398
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,883
the stories fought and out of that fight
emerged this story and that was a good 

399
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,230
enough story.
So everyone was happy with it.

400
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,660
And the story was.
Sorry,

401
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,663
I know we have to start.
The story was whatever Martin 

402
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,160
represents,
that's top God.

403
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,860
And so what did he represent?
Vision,

404
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,930
attention and speech,
and so the Mesopotamians already figured

405
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:35,500
out everything else should be 
subordinate to vision,

406
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,620
attention and speech.
It's like good work.

407
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:39,550
Mesopotamians.

408
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,023
Sorry.
It's my daughter and she wants to pick 

409
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,340
me up.
Hello?

410
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,780
Hi there.
Where are you?

411
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,230
Okay,
but bye.

412
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,700
All right,
so one final thing.

413
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,150
The Mesopotamian emperor emperor was 
charged with the imitation of Martin.

414
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,980
That's what made him sovereign so,
so it's not arbitrary.

415
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:08,814
It's like if he was going to be 
sovereign and he was going to be a good 

416
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,154
sovereign,
that meant he had to be a good Marduk 

417
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,330
and we'll talk about that when we meet 
again.
