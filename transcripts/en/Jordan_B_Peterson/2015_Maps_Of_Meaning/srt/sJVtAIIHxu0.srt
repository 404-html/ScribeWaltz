1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,593
And I want to tell you the story today 
that set the foundation of Western 

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:10,761
civilization or one of the stories that 
the foundation of Western civilization,

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,624
because I think the Egyptian story 
qualifies and I think the Mesopotamian 

4
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:20,400
story qualifies.
And so this is the Judeo Christian,

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,310
um,
genesis story,

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,090
which I think is,
it's a staggering story.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,273
Um,
if you look at the structure of the Old 

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,140
Testament,
what,

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,250
what happens first near the first is 
that there's,

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,743
there's two things that constitute what 
I think are a radical split between 

11
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,601
different forms of time.
And so one of them is Noah's flood where

12
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,150
all the chaos comes washing back in the 
world is remade.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,463
So there's the,
like the time before the flood now in 

14
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:59,661
more traditional Christian societies,
so say 150 years ago,

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,313
that was definitely considered a special
kind of time before the flood compared 

16
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,140
to after the flood.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,860
And I think that the old testament is 
set up that way.

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,903
There's also the tower of Babel.
So this story of the Tower of Babel 

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,174
where people build a tower that's going 
to reach to heaven and God basically 

20
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,614
stops them by making it unable to 
communicate with each other and then 

21
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,720
they dispersed around the world.
That's also a kind of chaos story.

22
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,690
So there's the tower of Babel and the 
story of Noah.

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,780
And then after that then there's the 
story of Abraham.

24
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:34,614
And what happens is that the stories in 
the old testament start to become 

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,420
historical.
You know,

26
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:42,000
they're like,
they're like tribal history in a sense.

27
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,830
Like they're mythologized tribal 
history.

28
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,450
So they're more than just tribal 
history.

29
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,640
But,
but before that,

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,474
I think what they are is they're almost,
they're almost pure archetype and we 

31
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:57,270
have no idea how old the stories are.
So we know that the story of creation in

32
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,430
genesis at the,
at the beginning of Genesis,

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,264
there's actually two creation stories 
there and there are timelines don't 

34
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,260
exactly match up.

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,590
And the hypothesis basically is,
is that one tribal group or,

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,753
or group of tribes had one creation 
story and another tribal group or group 

37
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,250
of tribes had another tribal creation 
story.

38
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,084
And they came together and they didn't 
really know how to sort out their damn 

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
creation stories because they both held 
them as sacred.

40
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,674
And so what seemed to have happened over
time was that those stories were told 

41
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,100
and then when they were written down an 
editor,

42
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:39,150
they called the redactor,
tried to sequence them so they made some

43
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:39,984
sort of sense and a lot of,
a lot of the Bible is actually the 

44
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,634
attempt to take diverse,
Archaic Orchid Temple and Cause I 

45
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:52,554
historical stories and to organize them 
in a narrative manner while 

46
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:01,600
simultaneously minimizing internal 
contradictions and so very,

47
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
very difficult thing to do.
And it's not like only one person did 

48
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,520
it.
Thousands of people have participated in

49
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,500
doing it over a huge stretches of time.

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
So the historical element of the Bible 
is probably roughly in the same of the 

51
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,880
same age as the Mesopotamian stories.
So,

52
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,803
you know,
you can stretch written history back 

53
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,660
about 5,000
years,

54
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,580
something like that.
Maybe a little bit farther than that.

55
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,790
So that's all we're talking about with 
regards to written history.

56
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,680
And you know,
people think of 5,000

57
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,170
years ago as a long time,
but it's not a long time,

58
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,690
you know,
that's only 5,100

59
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,524
year old men.
So it's a very interesting way to think 

60
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,221
about it.
You know,

61
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,860
that's,
that's not a very long,

62
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,610
long period of time.
The stories before the flood,

63
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:53,110
I think they're,
they're indeterminately ancient.

64
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,260
I think they have their roots in like 
very,

65
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,094
very early shamonic practices and their 
associated with ways of thinking that 

66
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,314
have characterized people ever since 
they became people ever since they 

67
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,060
became whatever we are.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,600
There have been human beings like us 
anatomically speaking for about 150,000

69
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,470
years and we're also a little bit 
neanderthal,

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,230
about five percent,
two to five percent,

71
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,970
something like that.
So,

72
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,971
but are anatomically similar ancestors 
have been around for about 150,000

73
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:29,614
years.
Looks like we discovered fire about 2 

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,393
million years ago.
So we've been cooking for 2 million 

75
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,220
years.
So anyways,

76
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,320
it kind of gives you a bit of a 
timeframe.

77
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,490
Now,
the first part of the.

78
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,043
There's basically in the genesis story,
there's a story about the creation of 

79
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,650
being and then there's two stories 
actually,

80
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,440
and then there's the story about the 
creation of human beings,

81
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,890
and so the first part of the story I'm 
doing,

82
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to read this to you because I 
can't.

83
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,210
It's too complicated for me to just spin
out spontaneously.

84
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,403
There are two structural elements 
described in the first chapter in 

85
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,040
genesis chaos.
That's one and heavens and the earth.

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,470
Okay,
so there's two structural elements,

87
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,453
one,
process creation and one actor God or 

88
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:28,090
the word of God who is engaged in the 
process.

89
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,770
The first structural element,
chaos is signified by a word.

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,400
This is a Hebrew word,
tail that means chaos by Tau,

91
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,444
who for waste or for matter,
without substance and by the Bohu for 

92
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,014
emptiness or confusion.
So the chaos out of which God extracts 

93
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,930
order has those elements.
It's chaos,

94
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,440
waste matter without substance and 
emptiness and confusion.

95
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,274
So interesting.
There's a psychological element there 

96
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,411
too,
right?

97
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,244
So I would say in some sense it's 
equivalent to the chaos that you fall 

98
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,360
into when everything falls apart around 
you.

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,583
And that's associated with a shamonic 
idea that during the shamonic 

100
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,004
transformation,
the Sharman goes back to the beginning 

101
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,854
of time,
roughly speaking into the chaos that 

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,794
proceeds the emergence of order,
and that's part of the shamanic 

103
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,000
transformation ritual.

104
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,270
So the chaos that the chaos that's 
conceptualized as the ground of being is

105
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,300
partly the potential out of which matter
arises,

106
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,820
but it's also partly the state of 
confusion,

107
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,654
that urine when everything,
when order falls apart around you and 

108
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,950
that that makes sense if you think about
it,

109
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:40,784
because the order that's being described
in genesis is the order that makes up 

110
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:44,684
being and so it makes sense when the 
order that makes up your being 

111
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,270
collapses,
that you're going to fall into something

112
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,104
that's equivalent to the original chaos.
It's a very interesting way of thinking 

113
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,544
about it.
I don't think it's metaphorical by the 

114
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,120
way.
It's not metaphorical.

115
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,550
It's a different way of describing 
reality,

116
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,320
so it's not like a metaphor for matter.
It's different than that.

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,173
It's.
It's a analysis of the structural 

118
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,134
components of being and basically what 
you have is chaos order and the thing 

119
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:13,544
that mediates between them and we've 
talked about that already as being the 

120
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:21,251
fundamental tripartite constituents of 
of reality itself.

121
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,143
There has to be potential,
there has to be something to interpret 

122
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,444
the potential,
and then there has to be something to 

123
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,304
mediate between the two things.
So these three words take home tow who 

124
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,084
and Vrbo who are very interesting for a 
variety of reasons and profitably bear 

125
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:42,350
further investigation.
The Canadian Rabbi Itzhak Marmer Stein,

126
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,000
who has begun to explain the Torah one 
word at a time describes tale.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,760
By the way,
take them entire.

128
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,530
Matt are the same word.
Okay,

129
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,090
so that's worth knowing.
And that's.

130
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:53,924
I got that from Northrop Frye.
So the tail is a is like the first 

131
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,030
syllable of the word tire,
Matt.

132
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,893
And so we know that the Mesopotamian,
some people think the Mesopotamian 

133
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,244
creation story preceded the creation 
story that's in the Judeo Christian 

134
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,950
account,
but no one really knows.

135
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,813
There was like a slew of creation 
stories with roughly similar 

136
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,550
substructures in the Middle East at that
time.

137
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,690
And the Mesopotamian stories of 
manifestation of it and so to the Judaeo

138
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,523
Christian story and they,
their temporal order I don't think is 

139
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:24,854
actually even calculable because I think
they both disappear into prehistory 

140
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,620
fundamentally.
So.

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,633
But it's very interesting to know that 
the tail is associated with the idea of 

142
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,271
time,
Matt,

143
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,690
because it also gives you some idea of 
the because you don't know what the hell

144
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,460
ancient Hebrew words mean,
right?

145
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,980
Well how do you know that you're,
you're not there anymore.

146
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,083
And so it's interesting to see the 
association network so you can 

147
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:49,790
understand the concepts.
And so whatever the tail ms,

148
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,400
which is this preexistent chaos is sort 
of like tie matt,

149
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,850
who's the terrible thing that raises up 
or head when chaos is,

150
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,860
is coming back.
It's also the thing that,

151
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,053
that Marta has to confront with his eyes
open and that figure is very much like 

152
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,483
the word of God in the Judeo Christian 
story because the word of God is the 

153
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,493
thing that's like,
it's exploratory and communicative and 

154
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,230
it's the thing that that raises order 
out of chaos.

155
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,543
So I don't think that you can understand
that without understanding or I think 

156
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:22,974
that understanding the Mesopotamian 
story and the role of Marduk in 

157
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:26,994
relationship to time outs sheds a 
substantial amount of light on the 

158
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,270
relationship between the word of God and
the initial chaos.

159
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,283
They're parallel ideas.
So one of the things that I should tell 

160
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,094
you about Christianity,
which is which is incomprehensible to 

161
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,470
me,
I don't understand it,

162
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,843
is that so one of the representations of
the word of God that extracts order out 

163
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,544
of chaos is logos.
And that's partly the root word of 

164
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,720
logic,
but it's a lot more than that.

165
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:55,554
Logo's basically means something like,
it means something like heroic 

166
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:03,030
confrontation with the unknown and the 
communication of the results thereof.

167
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,590
It's,
it means roughly that.

168
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,933
And one of the things that the 
Christians did was assimilate Christ to 

169
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,420
the logos that existed at the beginning 
of time.

170
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,433
It's a very,
very strange idea and it's a kind of 

171
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,170
mystical or artistic insight that's 
difficult to,

172
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,483
to.
It's difficult to understand how that 

173
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,420
idea could even happen.
And so,

174
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,450
so in some sense,
what the Christians did with the idea of

175
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,284
logos by associating that with Christ 
was to make Christ who's at redeemer 

176
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,204
figure into the same thing that 
generated order out of chaos at the 

177
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,374
beginning of time.
And so that part kind of puts them in 

178
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:44,151
the same conceptual class as horace and 
in the same conceptual class as Marduk.

179
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,303
And I'll tell you later that it also 
puts them in the same conceptual class 

180
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,710
as Buddha.
But I'll get to that story later.

181
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,963
So.
So also what that means is that there's 

182
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,723
an idea that that lurks latently in 
Christianity that the ideal person is 

183
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,630
I'm.
And that's partly the person who accepts

184
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,464
the necessity of death and rebirth as 
part of the redemptive process is 

185
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,424
identical to the thing that at the 
beginning of time called order out of 

186
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,784
chaos.

187
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,930
It's a phenomenal conception.
And one of the things that I've tried to

188
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,764
argue in a paper that no one's ever read
is that the reason that Western culture 

189
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,430
is predicated on the idea that human 
beings have an unalterable divinity,

190
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:31,740
which is basically the source of their 
natural rights,

191
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:32,574
is because it's predicated on the idea 
that the individual consciousness 

192
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,060
partakes of the process that's capable 
of pulling order out of chaos or capable

193
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,264
of mediating between the two.
And if there's something that's 

194
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,874
literally divine about that.
And one of the things that I also 

195
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:53,421
promote in this paper is that you all 
believe that because you act on it,

196
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,403
like you accept the idea that that there
are natural rights and that people have 

197
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,940
individual rights and that they have 
intrinsic value.

198
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,983
You don't know why and you don't know 
what that idea is predicated on from a 

199
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,484
metaphysical perspective,
but you do accept it and you do act it 

200
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:09,820
out.

201
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,653
And so to me,
what that means is you believe it 

202
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,150
whether you know it or not.
Now you can argue about that because you

203
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,550
can argue about what it means to believe
something.

204
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,713
But I tend to think that belief exists 
in relationship to action rather than 

205
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,350
into in relationship to objective 
conceptualization.

206
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,663
And so the idea,
and then there's a very interesting 

207
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,394
little twist in the genesis story 
because what happens when God makes man 

208
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,950
and woman,
and this is a very bizarre thing,

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
is that he basically says that men and 
women are made in the image of God.

210
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,620
Now God in that particular story is 
plural,

211
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,560
but that's not really relevant to our,
to our concerns.

212
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,890
And I think that's remarkable in a 
variety of ways because number one,

213
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:53,410
while we don't exactly know what the 
image of God means,

214
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,060
but we can place that in relationship to
the idea that it was the word of God,

215
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,880
that that extracted order out of chaos.

216
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,713
And so what that seems to intimate is 
that it's the capacity of the human 

217
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,911
being to extract order from chaos that's
equivalent to divinity,

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,610
perhaps in a reduced form.
And I think that that's A.

219
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,300
I think we believe that.
I think that we believe that.

220
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,450
And I think it's right even worse than 
that.

221
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,320
And then the other thing that's so damn 
bizarre about that is it's not just men,

222
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,110
it's women too.
And that's,

223
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,193
that's something that I have very 
difficult time accounting for because I 

224
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,204
don't understand why society that was as
deeply patriarchal as say the ancient 

225
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:43,690
Jewish society,
why in the world that,

226
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,880
that would also be attributed to women.
But it is anyway.

227
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:48,000
So it doesn't matter.
So the,

228
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,700
you know,
the,

229
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,533
the,
the,

230
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,170
the identity with God is equally 
distributed between men and women.

231
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,780
So that's quite cool.
So anyways,

232
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,910
back to rabbi,
it's Jack.

233
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,970
More marmer Stein,
he describes tail as the unfathomable,

234
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,163
undifferentiated womb,
out of which existence as we experience 

235
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,184
it emerges.
All potential exists in this primordial 

236
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:17,050
energy or state.
So its potential.

237
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,380
So in some sense that's what the chaos 
has potential.

238
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,423
And so I've been thinking about that for
a long time too because it seems to me 

239
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:26,290
that what people actually interact with 
his potential,

240
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,990
you know,
we think we interact with matter,

241
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,930
but I don't think we do.
I think we interact with all the various

242
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,600
possibilities that matter might 
manifest.

243
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,673
And that's not the same thing.
So that when you're interfacing with 

244
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,430
your existence,
what you're doing is taking a very large

245
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,264
number of potential futures which are 
basically laid out in front of you and 

246
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,950
actualizing one or the other as a matter
your choice,

247
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,970
and so I think the thing you're 
interacting with isn't matter.

248
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,953
It's the multiple potential states that 
matter could manifest itself yet and I 

249
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,634
think that's what we call potential and 
consciousness seems to collapse that 

250
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:08,540
into an act into into actuality.
So

251
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,690
all potential exists in this primordial 
energy or state.

252
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,340
Metaphorically.
It is a confused.

253
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:16,960
See the mask,
the abyss,

254
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:17,794
the deep and the surging bellowing of 
the waves toe who similarity is a 

255
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,334
chaotic condition.
So That's interesting because there's a 

256
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,154
psychological element there or a place 
without color or form or more 

257
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:37,480
specifically something that seems to for
a moment to have form,

258
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,100
but when looked at again loses that form
total.

259
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,973
Who is this subjective effect of chaos?
The forest that confounds people and 

260
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,590
that causes them to have misleading 
visions.

261
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,160
So it's very psychological in nature 
that that particular concept.

262
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,070
And then Vrbo,
who finally is related to Tau,

263
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,720
who I'm sure I'm pronouncing those 
wrong,

264
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,190
but means more specifically the 
indistinct entangled,

265
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,024
confused mass that all forms once were 
prior to their division into separate 

266
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:13,441
kinds of objects,
so

267
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,990
the heavens and the earth,
so those are the next elements out,

268
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,543
apart from the chaos comprise the vast 
and spiritually stunning places that 

269
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,234
rise above us as well as the material 
domain that makes up our physical being 

270
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,463
and the physical being of those things 
we experience this material domain is 

271
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:41,204
both a trap in which our consciousnesses
are caught and the a prior precondition 

272
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:48,890
for individual existence and it's 
destructive and vulnerable,

273
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:49,724
but potentially redemptive aspects.
The creation narrative in genesis has 

274
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,950
deeply embedded within it the idea that 
the materiality of the world clothes,

275
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,993
partial beings,
incomplete avatars of God whose purpose 

276
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,794
is the continuation and potential 
perfection of the incompletely manifest 

277
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,440
being characterizing the original 
creation.

278
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,320
This process.
So that's,

279
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,183
that's the process.
Now we've got the order and we've got 

280
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,850
the chaos,
and now we've got the process.

281
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,900
The process creation is characterized by
the second word in genesis,

282
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,853
which is Barbara.
According to the cabalist aiden Stein 

283
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:25,784
celts,
the creation represented by Barbra is 

284
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,880
not the coming into existence of 
something new,

285
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,553
but the transmutation of a divine and 
illimitable reality in some into 

286
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:42,830
something defined and delimited 
particularized and actualized.

287
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,060
This analysis of Barbara seems very 
illuminating first because it attributes

288
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:50,280
genuinely creative power to 
consciousness and cognition,

289
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,910
creative,
the limiting and second because it seems

290
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,730
so closely related to the Christian idea
of the logos,

291
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,690
logos,
one of the most remarkable of all,

292
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,524
the ancient philosophical or theological
conceptions is a word with an 

293
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:08,160
extraordinarily broad range of meaning.
It means our everything.

294
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,560
Our modern word consciousness means 
more.

295
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,830
It means mind and the creative actions 
of mind.

296
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,630
Exploration,
discovery,

297
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:16,464
reconceptualization reason and speech.
Logos is further something whose 

298
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:21,894
relationship to the mirror material is 
so fundamental that the material does 

299
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,460
not really exist at all in its absence.
Finally,

300
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,990
it is something whose workings are 
essentially redemptive,

301
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,810
continuing and perfecting the process of
creation.

302
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,453
It is generally transcribed in the 
Christian tradition as the word and is 

303
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:41,724
closely identified with the 
transcendental being of Christ as well 

304
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,740
as with the original creative force of 
God.

305
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,850
This is a very peculiar identification 
from the perspective of strip tap,

306
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,743
strict temporal logic because it is the 
word of God that creates order out of 

307
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:56,814
chaos and that word is a phenomenon that
predates the birth of Christ from the 

308
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:04,200
temporal perspective.
So that's all exceptionally.

309
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,210
It's very.
It's exceptionally incomprehensible,

310
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,610
I would say.
Fundamentally,

311
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,743
it's an unbelievable matrix of 
sophisticated ideas and one of the 

312
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:21,120
reasons I started to explore this was 
because you know I was very obsessed,

313
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:21,954
as you all know,
with the dynamic struggle between 

314
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,490
essentially between Soviet communism and
the western Worldview,

315
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,790
and if you're a rationalist and a 
relativist,

316
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,893
then basically what you have to proclaim
is that both societies predicated 

317
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,574
themselves on arbitrary axiom,
so arbitrary descriptions of right and 

318
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:43,104
wrong,
and that basically what was happening 

319
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,330
was that there was a war to see which of
those arbitrary systems would dominate.

320
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,220
But I thought,
well,

321
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,820
if it's just a matter of arbitrary ness,
then we're really in trouble.

322
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,740
Because the only way you could pause.
First of all,

323
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,580
neither of those systems are right or 
better in any real sense of the word.

324
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,623
And second,
the only way that could be possibly 

325
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,400
settled is by brute force.
So then I thought,

326
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,234
well,
what if I look into the origins of the 

327
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,870
ideas that are characteristic of the 
West?

328
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,990
We know where the bloody communist ideas
came from because they were written down

329
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,640
by marks.
That's pretty obvious,

330
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,420
but the ideas of things like natural 
rights in the West,

331
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,110
they're very peculiar ideas.
They're obviously metaphysical ideas and

332
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:23,610
then you might ask yourself,
well,

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,833
are those mirror arbitrary statements or
if there's something deeper underneath 

334
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,280
them.
And so that's partly what led me back to

335
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,440
the analysis of these texts,
for example,

336
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,630
because the idea has emerged out of the 
text.

337
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:40,380
It's not like somebody just sat around 
and thought the damn things up.

338
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,890
They're very,
very old ideas and it doesn't look to me

339
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:47,860
like the matrix that they emerged out.
It was actually a matrix ideas.

340
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:52,210
It was more like a matrix of behavior 
and it's over thousands and thousands of

341
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,044
years.
And so that's when I started to 

342
00:20:55,301 --> 00:21:00,301
understand that the conception of the 
individual in the West is something like

343
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,820
that which mediates between order and 
chaos.

344
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,680
And that,
that's not merely a,

345
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,650
that's an ontological statement rather 
than a theoretical statement.

346
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,630
It's a statement about the nature of 
reality,

347
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,390
not about models,
so to speak.

348
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,011
Um,
you know,

349
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:18,844
I would add to that the fact that we 
don't understand a damn thing about 

350
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:21,544
consciousness except that it clearly 
exists and that it also seems to me to 

351
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,440
be phenomenally logically accurate.
I mean,

352
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,473
when you guys are,
you're all in this situation right now 

353
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,400
and probably possessed by anxiety 
because of it,

354
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,773
as soon as you graduate,
what emerges in front of you is a huge 

355
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,610
field of an map potential.

356
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,340
And it seems to me that there's no other
way of saying that it's more accurate.

357
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,690
So we could just assume that that is 
what confronts you and what you're doing

358
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:50,524
as you navigate your way through it in 
one form or another is actualizing that 

359
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,324
potential into some,
into some reality that you inhabit that 

360
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,860
is hopefully operating in accordance 
with what you both need and want.

361
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,873
But you certainly view yourself as at 
least to some degree as a being that is 

362
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:09,970
capable of doing that.
It seems to me,

363
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,073
I mean,
you assume that you can choose what 

364
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,780
you're going to do after you go to 
university,

365
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:18,781
like you don't have infinite choice and 
it seems perfectly reasonable to presume

366
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,710
that that's anxiety provoking.
Why wouldn't it be?

367
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:22,544
We also know from the empirical research
that and unstructured future is hard on 

368
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:29,120
people.
They produce stress hormones like mad if

369
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,650
they don't know what they're doing or 
why,

370
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,040
if there's a lot of unexpected potential
lying around.

371
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,440
All right.

372
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,153
The fundamental story of the first part 
of Genesis is predicated on the 

373
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:46,800
assumption that chaos can be 
conceptualized as a matrix,

374
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,470
as something with a metaphorically 
female aspect.

375
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,543
A matrix by the way,
that's a matrix is something out of 

376
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:57,240
which matter arises.
It's the same word Matrix matter,

377
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,253
mother.
Those are all the same words and one of 

378
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:03,810
the things that's very interesting about
the word matter is that we use it in two

379
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:04,644
ways,
right?

380
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,730
And I think it's a reflection of the 
Tohu wa Bohu divide.

381
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,833
One thing is things are made out of 
matter and then the other thing is that 

382
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:17,841
things matter and part of the Old 
Testament conceptualization of matter is

383
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:19,284
that it's partly matter and partly what 
matters and part of the Old Testament 

384
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,033
conceptually conceptualization of matter
is that the world is made out of what 

385
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:32,054
matters.

386
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,443
So

387
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,050
and I again,
I don't think that's a metaphor.

388
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,153
I think your.
I think your nervous system is actually 

389
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:40,794
set up in that manner because the way 
your brain reacts to the world is if it 

390
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,724
matters and since your brain evolved and
since we don't know any other way of 

391
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,100
producing an entity that can adapt to 
reality without evolution,

392
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,503
then the fact that your brain evolved to
treat the world as if it matters would 

393
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:00,914
indicate that the reason for that is 
because it matters and I don't see any 

394
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,484
way out of that argument so that because
the normal argument is the physical 

395
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:14,030
substrate is primary and anything that 
matters is EPA phenomenal,

396
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:14,864
right?
That's part of the subjective or 

397
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,913
quality,
but I don't see any evidence whatsoever 

398
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,294
that that's how your brain is organized.
I think all the evidence suggests the 

399
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,444
opposite and that what you're first 
attracted to what matters and then you 

400
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:31,301
parse it out into the world so till good
you try on tangling that,

401
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,810
but I haven't been able to untangle it 
so.

402
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,503
Right,

403
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,300
right.
Well,

404
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,280
yeah,
but that is hard to Chris' point is that

405
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,373
that meaning manifests itself that 
that's why he's a phenomenologist 

406
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,830
because the root word of phenomenology 
is famous thought,

407
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:13,610
which means to shine forth and it's the 
eight priority state.

408
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,230
Right.
And you know,

409
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:20,231
I think that you can assimilate those 
theories to ideas like the root,

410
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,123
the ground of existence is something 
like information rather than something 

411
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:26,814
like matter.
It's actually not like matter because 

412
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,940
what's ever at the ground of the world,
we have no idea about.

413
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:33,750
It doesn't even act like matter.
It's very strange stuff,

414
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,270
but I think it acts at least as much 
information as it does matter,

415
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,320
extreme limitation,
the care that you care about,

416
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,900
the things that go on that rebate 
rebate.

417
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,573
You mentioned that the only reason tutor
and if your mind is that your mind is 

418
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,340
limited and so it has a certain number 
of calories and things like that,

419
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,950
and as a result things matter more than 
others and so it looks like so.

420
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,011
Right?
Right.

421
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:28,661
Well that,
that,

422
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,890
that yes,
that's a reflection of the idea.

423
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:34,010
That limited limitation has utility,
you know,

424
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,230
and so that or that even that limitation
is a precondition for meaning or,

425
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,730
or more.
I think limitation is a precondition for

426
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:41,564
being.
So one of the things that lead me to 

427
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:46,970
conclude is that there's a,
there's a,

428
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:47,804
there's a logic in that if there can't 
be being without limitation and 

429
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,254
limitation producers tragedy,
then how is it possible to have being 

430
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,550
that's acceptable?
And I think the answer to that is,

431
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,590
well that's what the redemptive question
is.

432
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,440
The,
the route of morality.

433
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,483
That the essence of morality is to 
determine how to live so that you can 

434
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,551
have being with,
with tragedy held in a band sufficiently

435
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,863
so that the being is worth having.
And it's a very tricky thing to do 

436
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,363
because of the tragedy is built into the
box and I think that what redemptive 

437
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,074
system's attempt to manifest portray 
there are a form of discovery is how 

438
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:38,694
that human being could what its 
structure is and part of it seems to 

439
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,520
have to do with truth.

440
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,923
You have to confront the thing that's 
tragic because otherwise you can't deal 

441
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,150
with it.
That's a big,

442
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,373
that's a huge part of it.
And then you have to communicate the 

443
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,540
consequences of that to others.
That's not all of it,

444
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,360
but that's a big part of it.
That's the logo part of it.

445
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,733
You know,
you have to embody the logos 

446
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,670
fundamentally.
So.

447
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,983
Okay.
So now I want to move from the initial 

448
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:14,030
part,
which is the,

449
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,310
the creation of something out of 
nothing.

450
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,160
The origins of,
of order itself.

451
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,160
I want to concentrate on the story of 
Adam and Eve.

452
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,353
And the reason I want to do that is 
because I think it's an unbelievably 

453
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:31,140
illuminating story in the same way that 
the Mesopotamian story is illuminating.

454
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,213
And I think it's staggering.
The degree to which the information in 

455
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,830
it has been compressed.
Now I think what happens,

456
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,210
it's something like this.

457
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,873
People are always telling stories about 
one thing or another and they tell 

458
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,594
stories down the generations and I think
what happens is that our stories are 

459
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:54,561
handed down across the generations.
All that remains of the stories is those

460
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,064
elements that cannot be forgotten.
And so what that means is that there's 

461
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:00,444
something centrally meaningful about 
those elements because that's what you 

462
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:04,770
remember.
You remember what's meaningful.

463
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:08,850
You get rid of what isn't right.
So if I tell you the story of what I did

464
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:11,910
today and you go off to someone else and
you retell the story,

465
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:12,744
you're going to compress it down to just
a few lines and those are the few lines 

466
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,870
that in some sense seemed to sum up the 
entire story.

467
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,410
And that's the part you didn't forget.
So then you might ask if,

468
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,920
if a thousand people tell a story for a 
thousand years,

469
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,233
what's left of the story and the 
straightforward answer to that seems to 

470
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:30,481
be,
well,

471
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,840
it's the part of the story that nobody 
can forget and that would be the part of

472
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,850
the story that's most richly meaningful.

473
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,500
Now,
why precisely?

474
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:38,334
It would be richly meaningful.
I think that's a whole different 

475
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:41,890
question and I don't really know how to 
answer that.

476
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,250
I think to some degree it echoes in 
people you know,

477
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,990
it's like we don't understand that 
exactly.

478
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:48,824
You know,
you go to a movie and the movie will 

479
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:50,884
reach a climax and all of a sudden 
little it'll produce an emotional 

480
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:54,370
release in you.
You know,

481
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,204
maybe you'll start to cry.
It doesn't mean you know exactly why 

482
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,490
it's something in you is responding to 
it.

483
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,061
So it's,
it's,

484
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:05,260
it's echoing in you in some sense.
So you might even say that the structure

485
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,580
of the story comes to match the 
structure of your caring.

486
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,553
It's something like that.
So it's a mirror of your psyche in some 

487
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,123
way.

488
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,743
The proverbial Chinese telephone game 
where you start with 10 people by the 

489
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,320
end,
it's unrecognizable.

490
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,390
I don't know that any meeting carry 
through though.

491
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,540
How do we know is is?
Well,

492
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,460
partly we,
we,

493
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,353
we.
There are actual ways we do know that 

494
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,120
because there are.
First of all,

495
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,240
what tends to happen in the historical 
story is that it isn't change.

496
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:50,030
That's the rule.
It's its permanence.

497
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,523
So for example,
grizzly bears now in grizzly bears 

498
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,310
150,000
years ago,

499
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,540
they are the same and roughly speaking,
the farther you go back in time,

500
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,630
the more people are the same from one 
generation to another.

501
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
They don't change at all.
So for example,

502
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:08,630
among the Australian aborigines before 
the Europeans came,

503
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,420
there's not a lot of evidence of 
cultural transformation over 25,000

504
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,293
year period.
And so I don't think we really 

505
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:19,070
understand the degree to which a static 
culture is actually static.

506
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:24,020
The same thing just happens over and 
over and the same stories are told and I

507
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,600
don't think they're told in exactly the 
same way as the,

508
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,110
as the story or the game that you're 
describing.

509
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,273
Because first of all,
the knowledge is distributed to some 

510
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:34,304
degree in everyone,
so even if you told a part of the story 

511
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:38,384
and you told it wrong,
then someone else is going to correct 

512
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:40,904
you.
So the story's actually distributed 

513
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,880
throughout the entire society,
so.

514
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,850
So I don't think it's nearly as fragile 
as people assume now,

515
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,703
I don't.
Obviously there are times in history 

516
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,730
where those things start to transform 
quite rapidly,

517
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
but I think that's what happens when the
population starts to grow and diverse,

518
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,233
separated community start to come back 
together and then the story starts to 

519
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,190
transform.
But other than that,

520
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:11,330
I think the.
The a prior condition is stability,

521
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,550
not transformation.
Now we do know,

522
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:16,790
for example,
there's a group of people on in northern

523
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:20,870
Japan called the Ainu and God only knows
where they came from.

524
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,750
There's all sorts of theories about 
that,

525
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,933
but one of the things that's interesting
about the a new is that they have a 

526
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,004
ceremony that involves the worship of 
bears that seems to have exactly the 

527
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:32,894
same structure as the structures of 
their worship that have been found in 

528
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,900
Neolithic caves in,
in western Europe.

529
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,483
So the way the bear skull is set up on 
the altar and so forth is the same as 

530
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:47,600
the caves that were discovered in 
western Europe even though there's a gap

531
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,420
of approximately 25,000
years.

532
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,943
So.
So I don't think that broken telephone 

533
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:58,811
analogy is quite right because that's 
the only sentence level first usually.

534
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,003
And the only person who knows the 
message to begin with is one person and 

535
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,654
there's no context for the message.
So it's an interesting analogy and I 

536
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,204
also think some of it's useful because I
do think stories transformed themselves 

537
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,194
across time to some degree,
even with the retelling because the 

538
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:20,210
language is going to shift and move and 
so forth.

539
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,920
But I don't think we should assume that 
the default position is noise.

540
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,990
I think we should assume that it's 
signal.

541
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,150
So.
Okay.

542
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,633
Adam and Eve,
the first thing that happens is that 

543
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,783
they were both naked,
the man and his wife and were not 

544
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:48,400
ashamed.
So the first thing you might ask is,

545
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,040
well,
what is meant by naked and what is meant

546
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:53,560
by a shaped.
And so then you think,

547
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,783
well,
there's a number of things about people 

548
00:33:57,131 --> 00:34:02,131
that are quite peculiar and one is that 
were clothed and although there are some

549
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:03,694
people who go about naked,
it's not the standard human position in 

550
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,320
the world.
In fact,

551
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,753
you can actually trace the the origin of
cloth using the evolutionary structure 

552
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:25,240
of lice because there are some who have 
evolved to hold on to cloth,

553
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,250
not hair,
and they've tracked the DNA development,

554
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:33,820
the genetic development of those lights 
back more than 25,000

555
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,510
years.
So people will use cloth and they use it

556
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,790
while they use it,
obviously for production,

557
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,310
but they also use it for all sorts of 
symbolic routines.

558
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,173
But the point is is that there it does 
seem to be a particular human 

559
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:46,924
relationship with the idea of nakedness.
Now you might ask yourself why and what 

560
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:54,904
does it mean that that the original 
people might have be naked and not 

561
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:58,804
ashamed?
And why would that be a surprise to the 

562
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:02,800
readers?
Because obviously one of the things that

563
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,634
sentence presumes is that the reader is 
going to assume that the fact that the 

564
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:08,284
men and women who were naked,
we're not ashamed is actually a 

565
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:15,280
deviation from the norm.
So here's what I have made of it,

566
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:20,281
and you can tell me what you think.
First of all,

567
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:22,180
they weren't self conscious.

568
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,830
Now you might ask,
well,

569
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,720
what would that have to do with 
nakedness?

570
00:35:27,721 --> 00:35:28,800
And I would say,
well,

571
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,843
a huge chunk of white people don't run 
around naked is because they're self 

572
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:35,730
conscious and there's a bunch of reasons
for that is that,

573
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,760
well,
human beings are standing up,

574
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,340
first of all,
like unlike other animals,

575
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,174
and so the most vulnerable parts of us 
are exposed not only to the world but 

576
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:45,774
directly to the view of other people.
And so most animals running around and 

577
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:49,724
all four,
and that means they basically have 

578
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,080
armored backs,
right?

579
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,093
They're most vulnerable.
Parts are not full center in front for 

580
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,870
for everyone to see.
So human beings also make face to face,

581
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:01,704
although they don't have to.
And that also heightened self 

582
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,140
consciousness and then in relationship 
to shame.

583
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,523
Shame is actually a emotion that seems 
to be manifested under conditions of 

584
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:20,170
judgment,
and so you might say,

585
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:21,004
well,
people are often afraid of public 

586
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:23,614
speaking.
Why you guys are afraid of public 

587
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,434
speaking.
How many of you are afraid of public 

588
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,040
speaking?
Okay,

589
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,710
how many of you are completely 
comfortable with public speaking?

590
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,881
Oh,
that's good.

591
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,290
That's quite,
that's quite amazing.

592
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,670
So,
okay,

593
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:41,190
so why might people be afraid of public 
speaking?

594
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,920
You Bet.
That's a lot of eyes looking at you.

595
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,413
Right?
And often people who are afraid of 

596
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:53,530
public speaking won't meet the eyes they
look down.

597
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,753
And what that basically means is they're
reacting to the crowd as if it's a 

598
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:57,604
predator.
The best way to overcome that is to 

599
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,484
start looking at people and you don't 
look at the crowd because there isn't a 

600
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:03,604
crowd.
You look at individuals within the crop 

601
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,450
and then that's no problem because you 
know how to do that.

602
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,200
So great way to decrease your fear of 
public speaking.

603
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,273
Okay.
So,

604
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,850
um,
how about speaking in front of a crowd?

605
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:18,790
Naked?
That's a common nightmare by the way.

606
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,520
So what do you think about that?
Sounds like fun.

607
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,350
No,
why?

608
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,320
Why more scrutiny,
right?

609
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,390
And so what's the problem with the 
scrutiny

610
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,583
it makes you so

611
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,453
why

612
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,050
secure?

613
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,883
Why

614
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,403
that's right.
You have a lot of flaws and you're 

615
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,530
bloody well aware of them,
you know,

616
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,260
and it's bad enough to have your 
intellectual flaw is revealed,

617
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,633
but to add to that your physical flaws,
you know when you can think about that 

618
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:50,530
as your deviation from an implicit 
ideal,

619
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:52,270
it's something like that,
right?

620
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,910
People don't like that.
That's why you never,

621
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,953
except for the naked news,
you never see that happening or you 

622
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:01,600
virtually never see that happening 
except under very specific conditions.

623
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,440
So part of the issue with being naked 
and ashamed is that the nakedness has to

624
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:10,870
do with flaws.
So you might say,

625
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,704
well,
what does it mean to see yourself as 

626
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:14,410
naked?
Well,

627
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:18,340
I think what it means is to see yourself
with all your vulnerabilities and that's

628
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:21,730
like your local vulnerabilities,
which just happens to be how hideous you

629
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,730
are as a physical entity,
but then there's even worse,

630
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:25,564
which is if you're really self conscious
and aware of what it means to be 

631
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:29,584
vulnerable because let's say that's 
what's at the core of nakedness is you 

632
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:37,291
also realize you're flawed mortal nature
across time,

633
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:38,914
so that's partly the burden of the fact 
that you're physically imperfect in 

634
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:42,904
degenerating all at the same time and 
that's something that human beings 

635
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,520
understanding that no other animal 
understands.

636
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,970
It's a big deal.
So I think partly the reason that we put

637
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,790
on clothes is so we don't freeze to 
death when it's cold,

638
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,120
but part of it also is this to separate 
ourselves from continual scrutiny.

639
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,130
A lot of that's going to be sexual 
scrutiny to and evaluation.

640
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,600
We shield ourselves from that so that we
can do some other things now and then.

641
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,690
So the original people didn't have that 
problem,

642
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,980
so I think they weren't self conscious.
That's the first thing to notice.

643
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,143
So okay.
The next thing that happens is that the 

644
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,360
outcome is complaining about the fact 
that he doesn't have any company,

645
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,880
right?
So God does this,

646
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:28,714
the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
upon Adam and he slept and he took one 

647
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,870
of his ribs and closed up the flesh 
instead thereof,

648
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,930
and the rib,
which the Lord God had taken from man,

649
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,150
made he a woman and brought her unto the
man,

650
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,283
and Adam said,
this is now bone of my bones and flesh 

651
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,020
of my flesh.

652
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,960
She shall be called woman because she 
was taken out of man.

653
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,273
So I want to read you something about 
this because one of the interpretations 

654
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,084
of that,
especially feminist interpretations of 

655
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,363
the story,
is that that makes women subordinate to 

656
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:57,814
men.
And it also inverts the natural order 

657
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:03,190
because obviously men come from women 
rather than women coming from men.

658
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,960
And so the idea there is that that's 
something like a patriarchal presumption

659
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,810
that overthrew the original matriarchal 
order,

660
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,120
which there was none of,
by the way,

661
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,060
that's a faulty.
You are anthropological theory.

662
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,820
There was never a pre patriarchal 
matriarchy.

663
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,560
It's a,
it's a,

664
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,394
uh,
it's a misplaced myth that says 

665
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,180
historicized because you know,
in the scheme that I showed you,

666
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,350
the feminine is underneath the 
masculine,

667
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:33,280
so to speak,
right?

668
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:36,430
So in some sense the feminine nature is 
out of that,

669
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,490
out of which culture springs,
but that's a psychological truth,

670
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,960
not an anthropological truth.

671
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,200
So the idea that backwards,
the idea of the world,

672
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,850
because if you're making one,

673
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,250
it is,
it is,

674
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,780
it is.
Yes,

675
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,180
and I'm going to read you why that is,
but yes,

676
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:00,014
it is exactly that,
but there's a reason for it and it has 

677
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,004
to do,
it has to do with the idea that the 

678
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:10,901
central element of human being is logos 
regardless of whether it's man or woman.

679
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,443
Now logo says are also symbolically 
masculine because it's associated with 

680
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:21,440
the heroic part of the individual.
So let me read this because again,

681
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:24,350
it's too complicated for me to conjure 
up on the fly.

682
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,640
So it is of course contrary to the 
entire scheme of nature,

683
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:29,474
that woman be derived for Matt and it's 
very tempting to read a simple 

684
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:33,254
patriarchal into that derivation.
I think it is more appropriate to give 

685
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:37,964
these ancient and incomprehensible 
stories the benefit of the doubt and to 

686
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:45,770
search for something more profound.
Logos is symbolically masculine and that

687
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,930
would be partly because of the idea of 
Martech against Matt,

688
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,813
for example.

689
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,403
There are diverse reasons for this that 
have little to do with simple 

690
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:56,480
ideological prejudice or with gender per
se.

691
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,790
The profound implicit idea put forth in 
this creation sequence woman for man,

692
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,103
is that the individual woman rather than
the mere female is a product of logos 

693
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,720
and not simply a daughter of matter,
matter,

694
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:12,554
mother or nature.
Thus the story does not denigrate the 

695
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:19,280
female as is now commonly postulated,
but elevates human being itself,

696
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:20,114
man and woman above it,
simply material and symbolically 

697
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:24,680
feminine substrate.
Now there's A.

698
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,720
There's a.
There was some.

699
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,763
There was a whole series of ancient 
writings that were uncovered in in the 

700
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:32,654
late 19 fifties that are now called the 
gnostic gospels and hypothetically 

701
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,790
they're new testament gospels have a 
whole variety of sorts that were,

702
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,620
that were defined as non-canonical by 
what became the Christian church,

703
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,200
and so they were.
They all emerged in the late 19 fifties.

704
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,800
It's a fascinating story because the 
people who discovered them,

705
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,950
if I remember correctly,
it's been a long time since I read this.

706
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,720
Their father had been killed by someone 
and so they went out to find the guy who

707
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,554
killed him and killed him,
and then they went to a cave to burry 

708
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,143
them and when they dug into cave,
they found all these amphora that had 

709
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:10,424
been buried for thousands of years and 
then they took them home and their 

710
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:15,104
mother used a bunch of the papers that 
were inside them to light fires with so 

711
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:22,070
the family could cook,
but an interior is dealer came along and

712
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,370
recognize them for what they were and 
squirreled them away.

713
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,290
Now,
weirdly enough,

714
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,360
and I don't remember how this happened 
either,

715
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,194
is that one of them,
one of these manuscripts called the 

716
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,184
gospel of Thomas made its way to Carl 
young and he was the only person in the 

717
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:39,314
entire world who had access to any of 
the gnostic gospels until probably 25 

718
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,040
years ago when they were finally more or
less released to scholars.

719
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,610
So that's also extremely bizarre.
So anyways,

720
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:51,200
there's a quote from the gauze.
Yeah,

721
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,340
it's very,
very bizarre.

722
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,800
It's a very amazing story.
So anyways,

723
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,634
there's all these gospels and now 
they've been translated in various ways 

724
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,510
and you can buy them as the gnostic 
gospels and the Gnostics were a group of

725
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:03,344
early Christians who believed that 
redemption could be attained through 

726
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,940
knowledge as much as redemption can be 
attained through faith.

727
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:14,810
And that was basically crushed by the 
developing Christian church.

728
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,733
So anyways,
young is often regarded as a kind of 

729
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:19,610
gnostic,
but it's still.

730
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:20,444
It's really quite remarkable.
And he ended up with the gospel of 

731
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,114
Thomas.
I think that's just like an 

732
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,950
incomprehensible fundamentally.
So a similar idea.

733
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:32,280
This individual woman rather than the 
mere female is a product of logos.

734
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:33,114
And so there's an idea and the gospel of
Thomas and similar ideas put forth in 

735
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,380
the gospel of Thomas in more thoroughly 
elaborated form.

736
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,610
Simon Peter said to them,
make Mary.

737
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,873
So he's talking about the disciples and 
Mary Magdalene is in amongst the 

738
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,153
disciples.
And so Simon Peter stands to all the 

739
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,140
disciples,
make Mary leave us for females,

740
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:59,940
do not deserve everlasting life.
Jesus said,

741
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:00,774
look,
I will guide her to make her mail so 

742
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,480
that she too may become a living spirit 
resembling you males,

743
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,380
for every female who makes herself male 
will enter the Kingdom of heaven.

744
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,200
So the question is,
what exactly does that mean?

745
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,880
Well,
I would say,

746
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,680
you know,
you can think about it.

747
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,850
What do you think's happened since women
discovered the birth control pill?

748
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,080
You know,
it seems to me fundamentally that what's

749
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:29,910
happened is that many women have taken 
on the attributes of masculinity.

750
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:30,744
That's what they want because that's 
associated with freedom and exploration 

751
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,590
and,
and,

752
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,920
and the kind of creativity that's 
associated with the mind rather than,

753
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,980
I'm not going to say mirror biological 
creativity because it's not mere,

754
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:46,110
it's important,
but it's not.

755
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,410
It's not of the essence of 
consciousness,

756
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:51,870
let's say,
or it's not of the essence of spirit.

757
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,153
And so I don't think that the birth 
control pill could have even come about 

758
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:57,954
as a possibility if there wasn't the 
lingering idea in western culture that 

759
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,600
attributing to women the same spiritual 
phenomenology.

760
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,960
That or abilities that characterize men 
wasn't the possibility.

761
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,513
Right?
Because you might say women were 

762
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:17,370
emancipated because of the pill,
but then you might say,

763
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,443
well,
what were the preconditions that would 

764
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:23,370
allow a society to do something as 
radical as to invent the pill?

765
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,073
Now,
obviously one of the preconditions was 

766
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:27,414
that there was enough of an agreement,
implicit agreement among the scientific 

767
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,314
community that the idea of allowing 
women voluntary control over their own 

768
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,270
reproductive status wasn't the kind of 
heresy that should have been punished by

769
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,343
like instant death.
And even even even though that idea was 

770
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:44,934
there,
there was still a huge battle and still 

771
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:47,214
is between Catholicism roughly speaking 
in the Western world and the idea of 

772
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,823
birth control because it's still part of
Catholic dogma that if you're a good 

773
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:56,640
Catholic,
you don't do that.

774
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,830
And I don't know if you know this or 
not,

775
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:03,831
but you know that I'm generally women.
Women have a menstrual period about once

776
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,450
every 28 days.
Well,

777
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,680
you know,
that's built in.

778
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,543
That was built into almost all 
formulations of the birth control pill 

779
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,750
even though it wasn't necessary.
So the guy who invented the pale decided

780
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:19,920
that it would be three weeks on,
one week off so that the menstrual cycle

781
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,754
would stay in tact so that it wouldn't 
look as much like a deviation from the 

782
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:27,240
natural order to all those people who 
are opposed to birth control.

783
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,403
When the simple matter is is you can 
take birth control all the time and 

784
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,340
never have a menstrual period and that 
isn't a problem or it's,

785
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,320
you know,
maybe it has to happen now and then,

786
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,213
but it certainly doesn't happen.
Have to happen on a weekly basis or a 

787
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:39,250
monthly basis.

788
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,533
So you believed in the 19 fifties he.
There's this phenomena that occurred in 

789
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,450
Catholicism,
again,

790
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:47,284
which I don't understand very well,
but part of the idea was that there was 

791
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,034
a shift in Catholic Dogma in the mid 
fifties and because there was a 

792
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:56,920
tremendous movement in the Catholic 
world to,

793
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,420
to,
to appreciate Mary as a Daddy,

794
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,780
roughly speaking along with Christ and 
God and the Holy Ghost.

795
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,400
So it was as if Mary was being added as 
the fourth part of the trinity.

796
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,773
And it wasn't a movement.
It wasn't an idea that the aristocracy 

797
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:18,870
of the church imposed on the masses.
It was exactly the other way around.

798
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,570
The idea that Mary was to be uplifted 
into heaven,

799
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:23,404
roughly speaking,
so she would be beside God and Christ 

800
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,434
was an idea that was really popular in 
the Mediterranean countries and also in 

801
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,750
central and South America where we're 
married.

802
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,593
Worship is a huge element of 
Christianity and what happened was 

803
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:36,724
because of that popular pressure,
the Catholic aristocracy announced 

804
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:42,094
berries,
and this is where I haven't got the 

805
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:43,954
terminology exactly right,
her ascension into heaven in the mid 19 

806
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:47,944
fifties and you believe that that idea 
was movement in the collective 

807
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:56,330
unconscious and the movement was that 
the.

808
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,353
The imagination of the western world had
progressed to the point where it was 

809
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,230
self evident that there was.
That their feminine element of being was

810
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:06,064
underrepresented in the idea of daddy 
and that it needed to be elaborated up 

811
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,100
with all of the other mostly masculine 
symbols.

812
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,233
And then he would have read that as a 
precursor to the possibility that the 

813
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:17,404
pill could have even become a.
An idea like the underlying imagination 

814
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:22,054
had to be arranged to allow that to be a
possibility before any of that research 

815
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:29,650
could have even been conducted much less
the product be sold,

816
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,090
you know,
because you have to,

817
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,083
you got to think how bloody much 
preparation does it take for a culture 

818
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,250
to allow a birth control device to be 
sold for general use.

819
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,620
It's not like that happens just because 
it's invented.

820
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,700
I mean,
forget that,

821
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,350
you know,
it's still.

822
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,200
People have by no means yet come to 
terms with that.

823
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,513
So

824
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,160
I'll,
I'll tell you the last,

825
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,400
the next part of this story and then 
we'll start until next week.

826
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,893
So,
and the Lord God took the man and put 

827
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:15,210
him into the garden of Eden to dress it 
and keep it.

828
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,223
Okay?
So that's an interesting idea I think 

829
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,660
because.
So what?

830
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:19,494
It's now.
Now what the story is proposing is that 

831
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:22,044
there's a universal habitation for 
mankind and the universal habitation is 

832
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:26,874
the idea of the garden.
Now Eden means well watered place and 

833
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:32,504
Paradise means it's from paradigm means 
a walled enclosure so that the original 

834
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,380
garden is a walled enclosure.
That's well watered.

835
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,730
Then you think,
well what exactly is a garden?

836
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,200
And it seems to me that a garden is a 
productive union of nature and culture,

837
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,350
so it's another order and chaos union,
right?

838
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:55,580
So a perfect garden is beautiful because
it's natural,

839
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:59,570
but it's also beautiful because it's 
attended to and paid attention to.

840
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,000
And a garden is also something that's 
productive,

841
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:04,310
right?
It's just chaotic wilderness.

842
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,060
It's a place where you can live.
So the idea is that human beings have to

843
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:13,061
live inside walled gardens and so 
there's a physical element to that which

844
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:14,264
is true,
and then there's a metaphysical element 

845
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,290
to it,
which is that the,

846
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,920
the environment of a human being is the 
proper ad mixture of chaos and order and

847
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:26,330
it has to be bounded.
So.

848
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:27,663
And then there's a,
there's a very interesting corollary to 

849
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:30,554
that,
which I think is tremendously 

850
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:32,414
interesting is that there's a snake in 
the garden and that's an interesting 

851
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,274
thing because part of that is the 
recognition that you can't have a place 

852
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:41,924
of bounded chaos and order that's 
productive without having something in 

853
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,910
it that's,
it's disruptive.

854
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,013
There's no way of getting the 
disruptiveness out and that's because 

855
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,720
imagine here's the problem,
and this has been discussed intensely in

856
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:57,643
Christian theology because there's a 
relationship between the snake and 

857
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:00,824
Satan,
which is something we'll talk about 

858
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:04,250
later,
but if you,

859
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:07,190
if you're surrounded by infinite 
potential in some sense,

860
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,920
and that's chaos and you try to wall off
part of it,

861
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,500
you can't keep the chaos out.

862
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,813
You can only keep it out partially in 
some sense because it's going to come 

863
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:17,654
sneaking back in because you can't erect
a wall that's going to keep out all the 

864
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:26,591
potential from a designated safe place.
And so if you have to live in a garden,

865
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:28,604
you're going to encounter snakes and 
there's a not even God himself can keep 

866
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:32,714
the damn snakes out of the garden 
because it's inevitable consequence of 

867
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:39,230
walling off a small section from the,
from the,

868
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,183
from the whole.
So let me see if I can give you an 

869
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:43,874
example.

870
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,590
Well,
I can think of a metaphysical example,

871
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:52,424
which is you know you're going to 
inhabit one of your conceptual 

872
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:57,980
structures and attempt to keep that 
matched with the world.

873
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,993
That's like a walled space.
You're saying these are the relevant 

874
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:04,070
things.
This is the place that I can inhabit,

875
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,143
but the fact of the matter is is that as
your walling off that little enclosure 

876
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:10,964
for you to inhabit,
there's dynamism all around you and the 

877
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,224
dynamism is going to affect the 
structure of this limited place that 

878
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:18,734
you're attempting to inhabit and at some
point it's going to poke his head 

879
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,214
through.
You just can't seal something off from 

880
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,490
everything.
The thing is going to come back.

881
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,241
Yet.
Now,

882
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:28,074
one of the things that happens in the 
genesis story is that the snake is 

883
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:36,360
actually something to which Adam and Eve
cannot not attend.

884
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,220
That's the other thing that's so 
interesting.

885
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,053
So the snake pops up in what's 
essentially paradise and human being's 

886
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:43,194
attention to z immediately drawn to it 
and I would also say that's what human 

887
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,180
beings are like.
You know,

888
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,073
if we've walled off something and 
attempted to make it perfect and secure 

889
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,580
and something pops up inside that's 
unexpected and predatory and attractive,

890
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,080
the first thing we're gonna do is be 
automatically drawn to it and then if we

891
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:03,690
interact with it,
what it's going to do is to increase our

892
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:04,524
consciousness and that is what happened.
As human beings evolved because one of 

893
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:11,100
the things we know is that we call 
evolve with snakes.

894
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:12,923
We call involved with predatory snakes 
and I'm lynn is bell has demonstrated 

895
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:22,491
that the acuity of primate vision among 
very large and diverse range of primates

896
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:23,544
is correlated quite highly with the 
prevalence of predatory snakes in the 

897
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:29,670
environment.
And so the,

898
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,440
the,
the,

899
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,020
the genesis story draws this 
tremendously complicated analogy.

900
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,960
And one analogy is snakes give people 
vision.

901
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,063
And the other analogy is the snake is 
actually representative of the chaos 

902
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:42,534
that surrounds every bounded order.
And so it tells the story of 

903
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,033
psychological abstraction.
So that would be consciousness versus 

904
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:54,390
the unknown.
And it overlays that on primate snake.

905
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,403
And it's because it's the same.
It's the same idea at two levels of 

906
00:54:58,861 --> 00:54:59,694
abstraction.
So you have the same reaction to 

907
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:02,604
unexpected things that occur in your 
pristine environment as you're distant 

908
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,344
ancestors would have had to the 
appearance of a snake and a place that 

909
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:12,660
they regard it as secure and use the 
same damn circuits.

910
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,823
It's the same thing and one of the major
claims in the story of genesis is no 

911
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:18,684
gardens without snakes and so you know,
the story is set up so that God tells 

912
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,873
men and women to ignore the damn snake 
and not to pay any attention with it 

913
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,350
north,
to interact with it,

914
00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:30,510
and also not to eat the fruit of the 
tree,

915
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,760
of the knowledge of good and evil,
which we'll talk about later.

916
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,250
But human beings don't do that.
They,

917
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,180
they interact with the snake and they 
become self conscious,

918
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,733
which is a catastrophe.
And that's how it shown in the in the 

919
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:43,854
story as well.
So as soon as human beings become self 

920
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:46,374
conscious,

921
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,460
they get thrown out of paradise.
So you can read it this way.

922
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,313
We got so smart by paying attention to 
the damn snakes that we figured out we 

923
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:56,854
were mortal.

924
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,493
They drove cortical evolution,
especially the evolution of the visual 

925
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:02,674
system.
Now I'm not trying to reduce it to a 

926
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:04,594
unit dimensional phenomena,
but the point is once you get cortical 

927
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:07,943
elaborated enough,
at some point you're going to discover 

928
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:14,920
time which we have discovered,
and once you discovered time,

929
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:18,010
you're going to discover one of your 
boundaries and what are your boundaries.

930
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:18,844
This is temporal boundary and that means
that you die and that sort of like the 

931
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,630
ultimate manifestation of self 
consciousness,

932
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,753
and then as soon as you know that you're
going to die while you're not in 

933
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:28,870
paradise anymore,
that's for sure,

934
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,033
and then you have to start taking.
You have to start preparing for the 

935
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:33,454
future in a self conscious manner,
and one of the things that happens to 

936
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:39,700
add them once God catches them,
after he's become self conscious,

937
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:42,340
as God says to straightforwardly,
well now you've done it.

938
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:43,943
You know you've become self conscious.
Now will all you're going to be able to 

939
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:50,680
do for the rest of history is work.
You're going to be condemned to work and

940
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:51,520
you might say,
well,

941
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,000
what's the definition of work?
That's easy.

942
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,583
It's the sacrifice of the present for 
the future and you won't do that unless 

943
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:00,814
you're self conscious because why the 
hell would you prepare for the future 

944
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,360
unless you knew that it might consist of
nothing but trouble and you know,

945
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,223
genesis portrays that discovery as 
something that's absolutely fundamental 

946
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:13,924
to the,
to the ground of human existence and 

947
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:16,883
it's only part of what it portrays.
And so we'll talk about some of the 

948
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:23,080
other details when we get together next 
week.

949
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,900
Now what I want to do is I want to tell 
you this story.

950
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,850
I want to show you how it relates to the
emergence of self consciousness,

951
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,863
and that's the collapse of paradox.
So it's the same idea as the descent 

952
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:36,364
into the underworld.
So the Bible in some senses a descent 

953
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:39,874
into the underworld and ascension story.
And it's precisely that because it's a 

954
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:43,654
redemptive story.
History starts when people descend into 

955
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,244
chaos and the entire historical element 
of the Bible is part of the attempt of 

956
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:54,304
human beings to lift themselves out of 
the painful selfconsciousness that 

957
00:57:57,701 --> 00:58:02,110
they've fallen into as a consequence of 
interacted with the snake and the fruit.

958
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,053
So.
