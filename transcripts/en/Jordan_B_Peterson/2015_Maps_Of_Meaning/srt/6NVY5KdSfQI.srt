1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,620
So the first thing,

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,023
first thing I'm going to do is to tell 
you what to do when you start speaking 

3
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,470
to an audience,
because some of you will do that in your

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,120
life.
So this is a hint,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,970
when you stand up in front of people,
do not talk to.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,610
They're all absolutely silent.
Wait,

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,520
because they'll quiet down.
Everybody will quite completely down.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,363
Then you want to wait until just before 
it becomes awkward and then you've got 

9
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,514
everyone's attention and if you speak 
before then you're giving permission to 

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:37,014
people to speak while you're speaking 
and you shouldn't give them that 

11
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,764
permission because the hypothesis is is 
that you have something reasonably 

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,790
important to say because otherwise the 
whole setup is ally,

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,920
right?
So just so you know,

14
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:52,260
it's a good thing to know.
And it also.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,483
I can tell you one more thing about 
speaking in front of people that's 

16
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,960
extremely useful too because it 
frightens people.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,793
Right?
To do that,

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,710
I never talked to the group,
you know,

19
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,431
because you might think,
well,

20
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm speaking in front of all these 
people.

21
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,290
You might think that when you're afraid,
that's not really true.

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,790
You're speaking to people in the group 
and you can move your attention from one

23
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,470
person to another.
If you speak to the group,

24
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,390
you're basically,
you're going to be terrified because the

25
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,224
group doesn't give you any feedback,
but if you look at individuals and talk 

26
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,994
to them,
then it's not that much different from 

27
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,604
having a conversation.
It is because you have to be prepared 

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,620
and so on,
but you can judge when you're looking at

29
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,454
someone,
you can tell whether they understand 

30
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,734
what's going on,
whether they're hooked in there or 

31
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,250
anything like that,
and as long as you're paying attention,

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
then you're going to utilize your 
natural skills as a communicator which 

33
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,970
you've been practicing since you were 
born.

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,463
So anyways,
that's two hints and they're useful 

35
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,924
hints.
So,

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,530
and I guess the other thing to remember 
is that B,

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,090
three hints is that it's really a 
dialogue,

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,493
right?
Even though I think I told you this 

39
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,824
before,
most of the response from the people in 

40
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,880
the audience is nonverbal.
That doesn't mean it's not a dialogue.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,893
So if you're paying attention to people,
you keep the dialogue going and 

42
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:06,180
generally that'll keep everybody's 
interest reasonably high.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,930
Um,
well anyways,

44
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,390
so I want to bring up some mysteries 
about words.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,433
Now

46
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,120
the first question might be,
well,

47
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:25,954
what exactly is a word?
Now I'm talking about words because I'm 

48
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:31,710
really interested in concepts,
but a word is like a unit of,

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,340
of,
of conception.

50
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,180
So I'll focus on words and will broaden 
out to concepts.

51
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,880
And the reason I want to talk to you 
about concepts is because I want to talk

52
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:40,714
to you about idiot logical and group 
identification and such identification 

53
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:50,350
is based in part on shared behavior but 
also in part on shared conceptions.

54
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,910
And the reason that I'm interested in 
group identity is because I'm interested

55
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:59,911
in what it is that motivates people to 
retain their group identity and also to,

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,200
to defend their group identity or 
expanded often at the cost of warfare.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,913
And then finally,
because I'm interested in why people 

58
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,674
will do horrific things to one another 
in order hypothetically to facilitate 

59
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,230
that process.

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,640
So that's the linkage.
So let's think about words for a minute.

61
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
10.
So the first question you might ask as 

62
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,610
well,
what is a word and St Augustine,

63
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,133
from what I understand,
formally posited that the word was a 

64
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,074
label for a thing and I would say that 
that's mostly what people think when 

65
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,860
they think about words,
which they don't do very often.

66
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,750
They use them,
but they don't think about them.

67
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,620
So a word to be a label for a thing.
All right.

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,450
Now that's a,
that's a funny concept because the thing

69
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,840
is often defined by words and so there's
a bit of circularity in there,

70
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:56,674
right?
Because for that argument to be exactly 

71
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,064
true,
the thing would have to be self evident 

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,943
sort of independent of any verbal 
formalization and then you could just 

73
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,944
slap a label on it and it's pretty clear
that our conceptual abilities also 

74
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,340
influenced the manner in which we 
perceive things.

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,560
So there's a reciprocal interplay.
So.

76
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,341
Okay.
So anyways,

77
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,980
that's one definition and you can see 
that it has some utility.

78
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,173
So here's another definition.
This is from VIP can Stein that can 

79
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,140
Stein said a word is like a player in a 
chess game.

80
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,093
One of the pieces.
And what he meant by that in part was 

81
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,184
that you're engaged in an activity when 
you're using language and the activity 

82
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:42,670
has a vaguely game like structure and 
the reason that you're using words is to

83
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,504
move ahead in the game.
You're a player in the game and so then 

84
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,590
you can think about,
well,

85
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:52,591
so that's another analogy that a word is
got a tool like structure and you use it

86
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,494
to,
to attain certain ends into operated in 

87
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,060
the world.
And so that's kind of an interesting way

88
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:58,894
of thinking about it.
And then I was thinking about this is a 

89
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,540
more visual analogy.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,573
So imagine that you have a,
a toy train and there's freight cars on 

91
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,360
it and you fill the freight cars with 
all sorts of different things.

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,313
Maybe one is full of screws and Legos 
and another one is full of erasers and 

93
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,843
coins and so on.
And there's a little tunnel so that the 

94
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,734
train track goes underneath it and then 
the train is continually running 

95
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,860
underneath it and that thing stays in 
the same place.

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,593
And that's like a word to now.
That's a trickier thing because a word 

97
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,970
in compass campuses,
things that are the same and things that

98
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,080
are different,
right?

99
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,973
It has to because everything that you 
try to categorize as an entity isn't 

100
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,520
homogenous.
It's not homogenous.

101
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,990
It's its internal structure varies.
So.

102
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,500
And that means that in so far as you're 
treating it as if it's only one entity,

103
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,690
it might do things that will surprise 
you.

104
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,143
You know,
so it's especially true with complex 

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,300
things.
So you might say,

106
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,640
well this is my wife.
Okay.

107
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,474
And that there's A.
There's a certain set of assumptions 

108
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:19,091
that go along with that label,
but and as long as those assumptions are

109
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,294
met,
which basically means that as long as 

110
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,784
the relationship you have with that 
person stays within that definitional 

111
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,804
box,
then you can use the term and you can 

112
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,460
get somewhere with it.
But because people are full of snakes,

113
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,520
you never know when they're going to 
jump out of the category that you've put

114
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,354
them in and manifest something that's 
completely unlike the word that you've 

115
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,334
been using to describe them.
And many things are full of snakes or 

116
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,264
you could say to some degree everything 
is full of snakes and that's why it's 

117
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,691
useful to think of a word as a place 
where multiple things move through.

118
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,063
So another example that you might think 
about is say a stock because the stock 

119
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:04,340
market's kind of a good model of the 
environment as such.

120
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,860
No,
a stark is like a thing.

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,220
So you can think of it like a thing and 
people do think of it like a thing.

122
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,383
But the problem is is that the stock 
itself is absolutely dynamic entity and 

123
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,173
what it contains at any given moment is 
far beyond your capacity to comprehend 

124
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,393
because the.
If you think about how a company is 

125
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,850
operating in the economic and then the 
biological environment,

126
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,150
I mean it's subject to any number of 
factors.

127
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:32,984
So for example,
you know maybe it's a coffee company 

128
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:35,984
stock and then there's some weird blight
in one of the coffee growing countries 

129
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,884
because I don't know,
maybe because people have been using 

130
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:42,674
water improperly and so then the coffee 
dies and their crops bad and then the 

131
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,650
price goes up.
It's like that,

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,623
that the stock as an entity in some 
sense contains the whole world and you 

133
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,360
can treat it like it's one thing for 
certain operations,

134
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,340
but most of the time that's really going
to trip you up.

135
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,710
It's going to trip you up in a serious 
way.

136
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,233
So.

137
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,180
Okay.

138
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,830
No,
I thought I had one more.

139
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,510
Well that'll do for now.
There's three different.

140
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,230
So I mentioned three different kinds of 
concepts and there is another one but I,

141
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,680
I can't bring it to mind at the moment.
So.

142
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,780
Okay.
So here's another way of looking at it.

143
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,353
The world is extraordinarily complex,
like it's insanely ridiculously complex 

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,620
and part of the complexity is the fact 
that,

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,773
and this is a hard thing to grasp,
although it sort of self evident once 

146
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:36,204
you think about it,
everything that you see exists at 

147
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,290
multiple levels of analysis 
simultaneously,

148
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,543
right?
And this is sort of like the train 

149
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:45,200
metaphor.
So you know,

150
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,120
for you to be you for a person to be a 
person,

151
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,350
there's an incredible number of micro 
structures that make up that person that

152
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:57,351
has to be functioning in no 
unpredictable manner whatsoever.

153
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,940
You know,
so it exists at a,

154
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,983
at a quantum level,
and we're not going to talk about that 

155
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,220
because there isn't anything to say 
about it.

156
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,090
That's intelligible.
You exist at an atomic level,

157
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:09,924
at the molecular level,
and then the molecules make organs and 

158
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:13,824
then the organs interact to make you and
then your nested in a family and then 

159
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,334
that family is nested in the city and 
the city's nested in estate and the 

160
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,424
state is nested in an economy and the 
economy is nested in a biosphere and 

161
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,400
every single one of those levels of 
analysis.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,750
It isn't that it's relevant to you.
It's actually that it is you.

163
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,603
Now.
You only figure that out when something 

164
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:36,510
goes wrong because as long as things 
aren't going wrong,

165
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,990
they're invisible and now that's an 
important thing to realize.

166
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:44,991
So one of the things that one of the 
determining factors with regards to your

167
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,240
capacity to regulate your own emotions,
including anger and fear,

168
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,113
disgust and a variety of other things 
we'll talk about is the fact that a 

169
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,584
million invisible things are doing 
exactly what they're supposed to be 

170
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,310
doing all the time.

171
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,983
Now,
the problem with that is that at any 

172
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,850
time any of those things can go wrong,
so and that's uh,

173
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,020
that's the problem of,
of finite mortality in a sense,

174
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,323
know that you're,
you're the sort of being that can be 

175
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:18,174
plagued by unexpected events at multiple
levels of analysis and it's by no means 

176
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,820
obvious which of those levels of 
analysis is most real.

177
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,773
I think they're all equally real.
It's also no small feat to pick the 

178
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,124
level of analysis at which you should be
approaching a given problem that people 

179
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,680
argue about that all the time.
You know,

180
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:38,514
when they might say something like,
what's the greatest problem facing 

181
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:41,994
humanity today?
It was like even conceptualizing where 

182
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:45,684
the problem is in that entire tree of 
being is something that you can argue 

183
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:52,290
about for forever and not get anywhere.
So,

184
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,843
so part of what I'm,
what I want to point out to you by all 

185
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,684
these examples is that a lot of what 
human beings are doing in their 

186
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,584
perceptual and cognitive operations is 
constraining the complexity of life to 

187
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,740
limits that enabled them to stay alive,
but also within limits that enabled them

188
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,060
to bear staying in lie alive.

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,253
Both of those at the same time because 
you want to keep existing obviously and 

190
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,113
hypothetically.
You want to propagate and but also 

191
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,324
hypothetically want to do both of those 
things while not suffering yourself 

192
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:31,761
absolutely to death and so that that's a
set of constraints and it's necessary to

193
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:34,494
know how much of the world his invisible
to you because unless you have some 

194
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,840
understanding of how much of the world 
his invisible,

195
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,290
you can't understand how many things 
might be going wrong when something goes

196
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,720
wrong.
And so here's,

197
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,610
here's a.
here's a a hint.

198
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,444
In some sense,
if something interferes with the 

199
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,234
integrity of your categories.
All the snakes that are inside those 

200
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,344
categories come out and then you have to
deal with all those snakes and that's a 

201
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,544
big problem.
And so you don't like having your 

202
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,950
categorical systems,
the adequacy of your categorical systems

203
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,470
challenged in any way and it's no 
wonder,

204
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,573
and it seems to me that this is 
particularly relevant with regards to 

205
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,384
social conflict between different ethnic
groups or between groups that have been 

206
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,164
historically isolated from one another 
to some degree because the groups come 

207
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,394
at the world with different conceptual 
structures and they're not necessarily 

208
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,400
isomorphic.

209
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,233
Some of the more fundamental assumptions
might not be the same from one place to 

210
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,474
another,
and that means the validity of the 

211
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,080
categories that both of those groups use
to organize their existence in the world

212
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,300
come under assault when they meet.

213
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,190
So it's a big problem.
And you know,

214
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,183
you might say,
well why do people engage in conflict 

215
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:47,674
all the time?
And part of the reason is is because 

216
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,594
there is conflict.
I give you believe one thing and I 

217
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,874
believe another and we happened to 
occupy the same territory and those 

218
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,670
beliefs have implications for how we're 
going to behave.

219
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,430
We're just going to be conflict.
There's going to be conflict.

220
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,264
And as far as I can tell,
there's a very limited number of ways 

221
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,360
that that conflict can be resolved.
One is I can become a tyrant or you can,

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,210
which one of us is a tyrant,
one of us is a slave,

223
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,343
and that you know,
the logical end point to that is one of 

224
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,554
us is alive and one of us is dead and 
the other possibility is that we can 

225
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,993
negotiate and see if we can figure out 
how to cohabitate in this territory 

226
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,970
behaviorally and conceptually 
simultaneously for a long time.

227
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,013
But that's extraordinarily difficult 
because it means you have to take your 

228
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:31,924
concepts apart where they conflict and 
then you have to figure out how to put 

229
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:38,260
them back together in a manner that 
actually works.

230
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,580
So when you might say,
well,

231
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,870
you should be tolerant.
It's like,

232
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,704
yeah,
you better be tolerant because you'll 

233
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,810
never get along with anybody if you're 
not.

234
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,033
But you should be tolerant is no answer 
to this question because the question 

235
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:49,841
is,
well,

236
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,910
how tolerant should you be an under what
conditions?

237
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,800
And believe me,
you can be too tolerant.

238
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,813
That's easy.

239
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,650
Sure.
I mean,

240
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,484
I gave you an example last week,
I think it's one that I really like 

241
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,140
because you're in a relationship with 
someone and they betray you.

242
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,120
Your category is not adequate.
Now which category?

243
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,351
Whoa,
wow.

244
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:17,790
There's a big problem.
You know?

245
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,510
The answer is you don't know which 
category,

246
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,733
right?
Because you don't know where the error 

247
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:24,634
is.
Now obviously there is an error of 

248
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,664
assumption,
but at what level and with what 

249
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,603
category?
So the problem is is that an anomaly of 

250
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,114
any seriousness calls the validity of 
the conceptual system as such into 

251
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:41,610
question at some unspecified double 
degree,

252
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,110
you actually don't know.
And that's a big problem because what it

253
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:46,944
means is that it's very difficult not to
react catastrophic Lee to anything 

254
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:53,984
that's unexpected because the unexpected
thing could have virtually instantly 

255
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,880
consequences.
Now usually it doesn't,

256
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,540
but what good is usually usually it's 
not that helpful.

257
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,090
So okay,
so fine.

258
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,313
So the world is very,
very complex place and it's doing 

259
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,104
unpredictable things and it's doing 
unpredictable things at multiple levels 

260
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,164
of analysis simultaneously.
And your problem is how do you act in 

261
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,304
that environment and how do you 
constrain it conceptually so that it 

262
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,184
doesn't kill you or overwhelm you,
it doesn't cost you a physiological or 

263
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:28,580
psychological damage.
So that's a big problem.

264
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,980
So,
and it's,

265
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,823
it's sort of a reflection of the idea 
that you don't have to learn to be 

266
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:33,824
afraid or on guard you start that way 
because the world is an incredibly 

267
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:40,070
complicated and unpredictable and 
dangerous place.

268
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,620
And then with a tremendous amount of 
effort,

269
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,753
both individually on socially,
you can construct up environments that 

270
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:51,410
are physical and conceptual within which
you can have some degree of safety,

271
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,790
security and the hope of some progress 
during your life.

272
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,510
So we're going to dispense completely 
with the idea that secure,

273
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,620
stable and promising is the normal 
condition of a human environment.

274
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,663
It's not.
And to keep an environment like that 

275
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,460
requires a tremendous amount of 
collective effort and individual effort.

276
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,220
So we're reversing the propositions to 
some degree.

277
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,293
Chaos is the underlying reality.
An order emerges from that with 

278
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,104
difficulty.
And then it's also maintained with 

279
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,700
difficulty.
You know,

280
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,790
I can give you one example.
I think if I remember correctly,

281
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,624
to keep a military helicopter in the air
so that it just doesn't plummet to the 

282
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,020
ground,
like the piece of metal,

283
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:33,854
it actually is,
requires something like 35 hours of 

284
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,454
maintenance for one hour of flight and 
the reason for that is that thing is 

285
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,264
barely a helicopter,
like it's just holding together by 

286
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:44,684
nothing and then you have to work like a
mad dog to stop that thing from falling 

287
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,830
prey to instantaneous entropy and just 
not functioning.

288
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,280
And a lot of our elements of 
civilization are like that,

289
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,740
you know,
they're in place so to speak,

290
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,900
but to keep them doing what they're 
doing,

291
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,734
which basically means to keep them 
inside the category that we placed them 

292
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,160
in.

293
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,993
It takes a,
it takes a tremendous amount and almost 

294
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,574
incalculable amount of continued input 
of energy and time and while it's 

295
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,550
counter in tropic,
be it right.

296
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,820
So.
And things have to be stable at multiple

297
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:17,654
levels of,
of differentiation for anything complex 

298
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:22,880
to maintain itself for any length of 
time.

299
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,390
So it's by no means entropies the 
standard,

300
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,490
the standard reality complex things 
decay towards their simpler forms.

301
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,383
That's the rule of existence and we're 
very complex forms and so we're 

302
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,763
chronically trying to stop entropy from 
tearing us into our constituent 

303
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,970
elements.
So okay,

304
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:47,840
now some of you have seen this before,
but I'm going to show it again.

305
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,950
Maybe you haven't seen precisely this 
version of it,

306
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:53,760
but this line of research wasn't piloted
by Dan Simon,

307
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,980
although he's done a tremendous amount 
to popularize it.

308
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,143
His demonstrations have become some of 
the most famous demonstrations that 

309
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:04,701
psychologists have ever put together and
this particular line of investigation,

310
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,933
although it might be old hat to you guys
perhaps was an absolute staggering 

311
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:15,651
shocked everyone when it was first 
revealed because the hypothesis was that

312
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,060
first of all that we see the world 
pretty well.

313
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,440
You know,
that we,

314
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,274
and when we look at the world,
we're seeing it in a relatively 

315
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,750
comprehensive manner and,
and that's wrong.

316
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,210
And then the second hypothesis,
which is,

317
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,213
which was a deeper hypothesis,
is that even if we don't see the world 

318
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:33,354
that well,
if something that's unexpected 

319
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,470
conceptually happens,
we will.

320
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,200
Our attention will be automatically 
drawn to it.

321
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,710
And that also turns out to be wrong.
So we're going to look at this video and

322
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,953
I'm

323
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,680
so the rule is here because he probably 
won't be to hear the sound,

324
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,713
you're going to see two teams,
one white and one black and the teams 

325
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,430
are going to move around.
They have a basketball,

326
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,560
each of them,
they're going to move around,

327
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:02,394
they gonna throw the basketball back and
forth to the other members of their 

328
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,874
team.
So the white dress people in the black 

329
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:08,754
dress people.
And your job is to count how many times 

330
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,790
the basket ball is thrown back and forth
successfully.

331
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,580
So you're going to be looking out the 
white dress,

332
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,310
the players dressed in white and you 
just count the basketballs.

333
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,690
And so if you've done this before,
well,

334
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,310
don't spoil it for those who haven't,
but you may not have seen this variation

335
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,670
in any case.
Okay?

336
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,364
So there's the grill of one person 
leaves and then the curtain changes 

337
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:47,284
color.

338
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,410
Right,
right,

339
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,730
right.
So it's brilliant,

340
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,110
it's brilliant.
It really is.

341
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,100
It's,
it's amazing.

342
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,630
In fact.
So.

343
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,183
Alright.
So you know,

344
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,740
when you look at that and you think,
what do you think?

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,833
If I'm concentrating on one thing,
there's a lot of other things I'm 

346
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:10,884
missing in.
Some of those might be unbelievably 

347
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,440
massive and then it's even worse as 
Simon just demonstrated,

348
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,274
which is if I'm concentrating on one 
thing and I'm paying attention for the 

349
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,190
possibility that something strange might
happen,

350
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,420
well I'm watching for the strange thing.
Other strange things that I don't expect

351
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,210
will happen and I won't see them.
All right,

352
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,044
so I like.
I liked that demonstration because it's 

353
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:35,764
such a concrete presentation of the fact
that we're dealing with something 

354
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:44,770
complex with relatively limited 
resources.

355
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:45,604
Now it's kind of obvious if you think 
about it because there's you and then 

356
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:49,594
there's the entire rest of reality,
including the reality that's within you 

357
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:54,180
that you don't understand,
but it's.

358
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,103
It's still something completely 
different to have that pushed in your 

359
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,960
face like that.
Now,

360
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,750
one of the,
as I mentioned before,

361
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,673
one of the propositions basically up 
until the time this line of research 

362
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:09,220
started,
was that you operate in the world with a

363
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:10,054
certain set of assumptions.
You see the world and you interact with 

364
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:12,934
it and the things that you're 
interacting and that you see are real 

365
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,470
and it's relatively straightforward 
matter to perceive them because they're,

366
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,313
they are like things and you can 
interact with them in a manner that 

367
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,680
produces a predictable outcome and if 
something radical happens,

368
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,514
you will automatically attend to it.
So that was the proposition of 

369
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:34,354
psychological theory,
psychophysiological theory for a very 

370
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,384
long period of time and it had a huge 
influence on fields like artificial 

371
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,104
intelligence before they discovered that
it was virtually impossible to perceive 

372
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,034
the world.
It's so complex that we can't really 

373
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:47,410
figure out how we do it.

374
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,430
Although,
you know,

375
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:49,264
in the last five years,
tremendous strides have been made in 

376
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,190
having machines that can actually 
operate in the real world,

377
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,070
which is something new and absolutely 
remarkable and amazing.

378
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,520
So,
but what,

379
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:02,260
what the bottom line for this turned out
to be that.

380
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,071
No,
no,

381
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,410
no,
you don't see the world.

382
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,430
You see a subset of the world and which 
subset you see depends on your intent.

383
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,511
Now,
of course,

384
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,980
that's obvious from this video,
right?

385
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:15,814
Because your intent when you're watching
the video is to count the number of 

386
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:18,874
balls that are being passed back and 
forth and that attend intent occurred 

387
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,953
merely because I asked you to do that.
And so one of the things that that 

388
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,770
indicates is how easy it is for you to 
shift what your goal is.

389
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,873
You know,
when human beings are unbelievably good 

390
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:34,840
at that.
Now for most animals,

391
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,733
goals are driven in some sense by the 
operation of underlying fundamental 

392
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:40,840
biological systems.

393
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,913
They're not just goals,
their whole schemes of perception and 

394
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:45,514
action.
They're like little subpersonalities I 

395
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:50,060
would say in that they're embodied,
perceptual,

396
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:55,061
cognitive and emotional solutions to 
classic biological problems.

397
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,683
So they're like.
It's like an animal's head is full of 

398
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:03,830
little robots and it's not like they're 
driven by a motivational system.

399
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,723
The motivational system is a sub element
of the animal that participates in the 

400
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:12,320
entire animal's being.
So if an animal is hungry,

401
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,333
then it sees the things that hungry 
animals sea and it responds emotionally 

402
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:20,600
to the cues that are associated with 
food or it's absence.

403
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,170
And it thinks in so far as an animal 
thinks and strategizes.

404
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,750
And some of them do,
like the hunters in particular,

405
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,673
the pack hunters,
then it strategizes from within that 

406
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:30,824
framework,
and so you can't think about it as a 

407
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:33,294
drive.
You have to think about it as an entire 

408
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:37,940
way of looking at the world and then you
kind of have to think of the animal as a

409
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:38,774
collection of different ways of looking 
at the world in accordance with the 

410
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:43,640
different problems that the animal has.

411
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,473
And then you're like that too.
Except as your cortex grew radically 

412
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,310
over the last several million years you 
underwent,

413
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,144
this seems weird transformation where 
you're timespan God extremely broad and 

414
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,064
your capacity for abstraction increased.
And one of the consequences of that was 

415
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,564
that you learned how to replace what you
might regard as purely biologically 

416
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,130
determined,
relatively immediate goals.

417
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,053
Although they're really personalities 
with unbelievably abstract goals that 

418
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,263
could be manifested in a social 
environment and that might work over 

419
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:23,240
very long periods of time.
And that's a whole different thing.

420
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,700
And so what?
What the upshot of that is,

421
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,534
is you can pretty.
You have a system that's that that 

422
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,313
allows you to formulate virtually any 
frame of reference imaginable and then 

423
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:35,984
to look through the world and act on the
world in accordance with that frame of 

424
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:42,470
reference so that I can just say to you 
your task now,

425
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,304
this is going to be something you value.
Your task is to turn yourself into a 

426
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:51,581
personality for whom counting the basket
ball throws for the next five minutes is

427
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:58,230
the PR is your primary aim in life,
and you do that.

428
00:25:58,231 --> 00:25:59,064
No problem.
You reconfigure your entire perceptual 

429
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:04,230
system so that you you feel inadequate 
to some degree.

430
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,050
If you can't perform the task,
you're motivated to do it.

431
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,600
You focus your perceptions.
You're pleased.

432
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,434
If you can track the balls,
you're pleased if you get the right 

433
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:16,680
answer and you do that at the drop of a 
hat.

434
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:17,514
So,
so that's one of the consequences of 

435
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:23,220
human cognitive transformation.
So now

436
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,820
what that also means is that from moment
to moment as a consequence of the varied

437
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,253
goals that you're pursuing,
you also make a determination of what 

438
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,640
you have to attend to and what you can 
ignore.

439
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,193
And the answer to the question,
what should you attend to and what can 

440
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:55,911
you ignore is you should attend to the 
minimal number of entities necessary for

441
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:02,640
you to produce the outcome that you 
desire.

442
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,553
Okay?
Now,

443
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,860
if you read classic cybernetic accounts 
of motivation,

444
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,803
the ones that are cognitive,
if you look at the behavioral theories 

445
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,400
of motivation,
they're mostly drive motivations.

446
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,560
So there's a deterministic element to 
them.

447
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,350
You're in a,
you're in a state of deprivation,

448
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,423
and as a consequence,
you're driven down a certain behavioral 

449
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,310
road.
Okay?

450
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,144
So that's the behavioral idea.
And there's some truth in that because 

451
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:31,461
some of your biological subsystems are 
fast and ancient enough,

452
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,850
so they do kind of operate as chained 
deterministic systems.

453
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,790
And in fact,
before you act in,

454
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,753
in any complex way,
you actually set up a system of chained 

455
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,620
deterministic events so that you can 
implement the action.

456
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,420
So I can show you an example of that.
So,

457
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,650
all right,
so what you're watching,

458
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,500
what my arm does.
Okay,

459
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:55,560
so you see that I accelerated it very 
rapidly.

460
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,140
And then just before he hit the surface,
I stopped it.

461
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,393
Now it turns out that I can move my hand
so fast that a new signal from my brain 

462
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,810
can't get to my hand during the time I'm
going like this,

463
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,153
and so what that means is that I have to
set that entire system of operations up 

464
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:17,061
as a ballistic movement and then release
it and you're doing that all the time.

465
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,200
When you're in,
when you're dealing with the world,

466
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,034
you have systems that are automated and 
that run into deterministic manner and 

467
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,194
what you're doing in part when you act 
on the world is you're disinhibiting 

468
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,340
them one after the other,
so you do that.

469
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,570
When you're driving,
for example,

470
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,673
where do you look when you're driving?
You don't look right in front of the 

471
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,220
car.
Why?

472
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,040
That's because you're going to run over 
what's there.

473
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,470
So what?
What good is looking there?

474
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,260
If it's something's there,
you're going to run over it.

475
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,094
There wasn't a thing you can do,
so what you do is you look far enough 

476
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:48,524
down the road so that you can sequence 
automated actions as a consequence of 

477
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,580
your perception and then they run in 
some sense,

478
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,820
they run ballistically.
You can't control them once they've,

479
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,370
once they've been implemented and you're
doing that all the time,

480
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:02,204
like you're wandering around on a 
platform of semi automated systems and 

481
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,853
your choice in some senses,
the choice of which of those semi 

482
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,290
automated systems you're going to 
implement at any given time.

483
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,640
Okay,
so you throw up a frame of reference.

484
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,140
We're going to talk more about them in a
minute.

485
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,760
He throw up a frame of reference and 
then you attend to anything that gets in

486
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,594
the way.

487
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,750
If it interferes with the desired 
outcome,

488
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,590
so that's not the same as merely 
responding to anything unexpected.

489
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:31,940
As you can see what the grill it.
Now,

490
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:36,380
if that gorilla would have jumped in 
front of one of the players in white and

491
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,214
grabbed the ball,
there's a high probability that you 

492
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:40,334
would have seen them,
especially if it would have onto it for 

493
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,544
some length of time because what 
happened there was that the anomalous 

494
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:46,594
event turned out to be a relevant factor
in your pursuit of the goal that you 

495
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:56,881
deemed appropriate.
So you could say that you respond

496
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,460
to the world as if it's a predictable 
place.

497
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,294
As long as it's doing what you want it 
to do and then you respond to the world 

498
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:10,421
as an unpredictable place when anything 
happens that stops you from reaching the

499
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:14,420
goal that you've determined to be 
relevant at this point in time.

500
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,583
And so those are,
in some sense you're two modes of 

501
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,564
operation.
Then you could also add that if you're 

502
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:22,820
pursuing a goal or embodying a little 
goal directed personality,

503
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,923
then things that facilitate movement 
towards that goal are going to be 

504
00:30:26,181 --> 00:30:27,014
positive and things that interfere with 
movement towards that goal are going to 

505
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,420
be negative.
And when you understand that,

506
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:35,420
then you've got some sense of how the 
fundamental emotional systems work.

507
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,490
So.
All right,

508
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:38,324
so

509
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,123
all right,
so this little diagram is designed to 

510
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,124
show you what the relationship between 
conception and and actuality might be 

511
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:02,230
and even what the relationship between 
conception and a word might be.

512
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:03,064
So the theory behind this little diagram
is that there's a set of phenomena in 

513
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:09,580
front of you that's too complex to deal 
with.

514
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,414
And so what you do is you generate a low
resolution representations of it and 

515
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:17,140
that low resolution representations is 
actually what you see.

516
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,380
It's not a concept or you could say it's
a percept,

517
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,480
it's what you see when you look at 
something.

518
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,853
So for example,
and then what you do with your words as 

519
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,930
you,
you labeled the percept of the thing.

520
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,883
And so it's like,
um,

521
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,150
it's like a double

522
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,490
compression.
That's in some sense what you're doing.

523
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,210
So you have a complex reality,
you perceive it in a,

524
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,970
in a,
in a low resolution form,

525
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,420
and then you labeled the perception and 
that gives you a word.

526
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:48,480
And so what you're doing basically is 
taking the world that you can understand

527
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,553
and you're make putting it in smaller 
and smaller and tighter boxes until you 

528
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:52,734
have a box that's small enough and tight
enough so that you can actually 

529
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,124
manipulate it.
And that's a fine plan except when it 

530
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,060
doesn't work.
And so then the question is,

531
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,440
well,
what do you do when it doesn't work?

532
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,700
And that is the question.
Okay?

533
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,310
So you could say,
if you look at the top left hand corner,

534
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,353
I call that the thing in itself,
which is a phrase from Sarah translated 

535
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:13,800
phrase from German philosophy in the old
idea was that well you never really have

536
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:14,634
contact with the thing in itself,
you because you're not capable of 

537
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,290
perceiving it or comprehending it.

538
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,840
So what you see are elements of it.
So we're going to say,

539
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:26,100
well that's the thing in itself,
it's a schematic representation of it.

540
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:29,430
It's quite complex.
And then hypothetically you can see that

541
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,640
thing in all the other ways that are 
illustrated in the diagram.

542
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,030
Right?
So if I asked you what that was,

543
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,013
you could say,
well it's a rectangle or you could say 

544
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,990
it's a with four rectangles as sub 
elements.

545
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,420
Or You could say that it's,
I think that's what,

546
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,060
24 rows,
which it also is.

547
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:47,894
Or You could say it's a bounded 
rectangle that's made out of two paths 

548
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,400
and for sub rectangles.
Or You could say that it's.

549
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,153
I don't remember how many are in there,
but you know that's the most 

550
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,450
differentiated representation.
Object Five.

551
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:03,261
And then you might say,
well,

552
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,160
which of those is the real object?
And the answer first would be,

553
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,053
well none of them are.
And then the second answer would be it 

554
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,000
depends on what you want to do with the 
representations and you actually,

555
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,230
it's not really obvious that you can 
make things more real than that.

556
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,483
It's like how real is what you're 
perceiving it's real enough for certain 

557
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,860
operations and not real enough for 
others.

558
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,653
And so

559
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,913
it's validity.
It's a pragmatic approach is it's a 

560
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,153
validity is determined by its 
applicability in the situation in which 

561
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,320
you want to apply it.
Okay.

562
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,813
And then at the bottom there are words 
and the words are basically labels for 

563
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:43,300
those percept.
So you know,

564
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,483
I'm the first one you could sum up as 
432 because I guess there's 432 little 

565
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:49,314
circles there.
And the second one you could on the 

566
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,064
bottom,
you could summarize as across or a 

567
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:54,684
rectangle and the one at the top you 
could summarize as a flag and you get 

568
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:00,114
the point.
So the word is representing a percept 

569
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:04,140
that's already simplified.
And that's representing something that's

570
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:06,510
more complex underneath it.
Okay,

571
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,660
so here's another way of looking at it.
So if you're looking at a computer,

572
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,300
your computer crashes,
we'll say,

573
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,270
so,

574
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,103
okay,

575
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,630
you're working on your computer and then
you might think,

576
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,700
well are you actually working on your 
computer?

577
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,780
And the question that they answer to 
that is,

578
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,663
it depends on exactly what you mean by 
computer and exactly what is this thing 

579
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:41,684
that's a computer.
So actually when you're working on a 

580
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,204
computer,
what you generally see is only the 

581
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,660
screen and you don't even see the 
screen.

582
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,733
You see that tiny sub element of the 
screen that contains those 

583
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,544
representational entities that are 
directly relevant to the area of the 

584
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:58,730
world that you're focusing on right now 
because you want something to happen.

585
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,043
Okay?
So really when you're interacting with 

586
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,004
the computer,
you're just interacting with this tiny 

587
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,664
little part of it.
And then the problem is in order for 

588
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:12,161
that tiny little part to maintain its 
validity as a representational entity,

589
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,200
all the things that you don't see about 
the computer,

590
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,060
half the work,
right?

591
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,900
And then you might think,
well,

592
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:18,734
what don't you see about the computer?
Well that's what this diagram is 

593
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,204
supposed to be showing.
So the first thing is you don't see the 

594
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:28,670
elemental properties of the computer and
that would be its existence at a quantum

595
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:29,504
level and that actually turns out to be 
increasingly irrelevant for computer 

596
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:33,614
designers because you know,
you cannot specify the location and the 

597
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,080
momentum of a particle at a quantum 
level with 100 percent accuracy.

598
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,640
And what that means is it actually has,
it actually has relevance.

599
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,803
The little wires in computer chips are 
getting so small now that there's some 

600
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,790
reasonable probability that an electron 
you think will be in the wire is outside

601
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,040
the wire.
And that means they'll short out.

602
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,990
So at some level of interaction,
the quantum properties actually matter.

603
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay?
So that's part of the computer you don't

604
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:06,180
see.

605
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,013
And then while the computer itself is 
made out of all these little parts that 

606
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:10,704
are as complex as little cities and it's
just packed with that and you what you 

607
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,394
don't know about that could fill hole 
volumes in any of those things can you 

608
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:19,170
know,
malfunctioned in any moment.

609
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,004
So that's a big problem.
And then those micro parts are arranged 

610
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,004
into subcomponents with a desktop.
Maybe you're a sound card is gone or 

611
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,580
your video card is gone or something 
that you could take out and replace.

612
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:33,620
If you could only specify the proper 
level of analysis or you know,

613
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,820
maybe you bought a lousy brand and 
that's the problem he bought.

614
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,510
Bought some cheap computer that's made 
in a digital factory.

615
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,910
And the probability that's going to be 
reliable as zero.

616
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:42,744
And then you might ask,
well why is it that that brand is not 

617
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,200
reliable?

618
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,250
And you might say,
well,

619
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,910
the economic system within which it was 
produced is corrupt.

620
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:53,700
And so as the political system.
And so as a consequence of that,

621
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,010
people can get away with shawty 
manufacturing.

622
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:00,420
And that manifests itself as the fact 
that your computer crashes in the middle

623
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,280
of an essay and then you might say,
well,

624
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,730
what's the right level of resolution to 
solve that problem?

625
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,580
And answer to that is,
that's not obvious.

626
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,743
It depends on what you mean by solvent.
Now usually what you mean is do the 

627
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:13,944
minimum necessary to get the system back
online so that you can return to your 

628
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,650
activities.
But it's by no means obvious that that's

629
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:23,484
always the right solution.
And sometimes it isn't because at some 

630
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,244
point you're going to say,
well I should just throw the computer 

631
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,300
away.
And you know,

632
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:31,134
if you own computers that when to throw 
them away is actually a complicated 

633
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,070
problem.

634
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,360
How many of you have like three or four 
old laptops lying around the house?

635
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,650
Right?
Right.

636
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,880
So like,
why?

637
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,010
Well,
they still work well do they really?

638
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,660
And then a deeper question is what makes
you think that they're still laptops?

639
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,913
And the answer to that is,
well they look like laptops and that's 

640
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:56,550
also wrong.
They look like laptops.

641
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:01,551
If you think that a box is a laptop and 
it's not and it with computers,

642
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:02,424
you can really see this way because you 
can have an entity that's fully 

643
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:06,690
functional,
a laptop,

644
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,823
and then if you just leave it on your 
desk and don't touch it for five years 

645
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,460
or let's say 10 years,
what is it then?

646
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,403
Well,
it's become so disconnected from the 

647
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:19,014
ecosystem that it's a part of that it 
might not be useful for anything 

648
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,244
anymore.
You might not even be able to get it to 

649
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,164
work and you know,
most things around us don't change that 

650
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,254
fast so we can.
We can perceive them in relatively 

651
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:32,274
simple forms and they don't transform so
quick that that shows us that our 

652
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:38,830
perception is going to stray,
but computers aren't like that.

653
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,993
They transformed so rapidly.
You probably spend one fifth of your 

654
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:47,560
time just trying to just trying to keep 
up with the transformations.

655
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,823
Do you think that is to be used,
the anticipation in a person that it 

656
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:57,160
could be used as a laptop if they wanted
to make it?

657
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,721
Sure.
Well,

658
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:02,920
it does to some degree.
The question is do you actually use it?

659
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,023
That's the first question,
so and that's actually the manner in 

660
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,164
which you test the validity of your 
perceptual theory because I would say 

661
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,810
that a laptop that you don't use is 
actually not a laptop.

662
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,170
It's just a hypothetical laptop now 
began to see.

663
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,320
I mean I'm being picky,
picky about these sorts of things,

664
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,154
but I'm doing that because we're trying 
to understand exactly how categories 

665
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:27,160
work and it is not obvious.
It's not obvious at all.

666
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,323
So the problem is is that the laptop 
actually transforms into a brick 

667
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,733
relatively slowly and deciding when it's
a laptop and went into brick is not 

668
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,340
obvious because it doesn't denounce 
that,

669
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,174
you know,
it just doesn't stop working all of a 

670
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,214
sudden.
It just works in a manner that's 

671
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:45,694
completely counterproductive.
And one of the things that's quite 

672
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,414
interesting is there's not a lot of 
evidence that the electronic revolution 

673
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:53,254
has increased productivity and I think 
the reason for that is how much time 

674
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,494
during the week do you suppose you spend
just keeping your computer updated and 

675
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,610
making sure that you understand how it 
works.

676
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,910
Like would that be 10 percent of the 
time that you used the computer?

677
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,070
Is that,
is that unreasonable estimate?

678
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:12,904
Like what do you think?
I mean I think for me it's like 20 

679
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,720
percent of my time it's horrifying 
because I have quite a few computers and

680
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,760
you know,
they're always doing weird things of one

681
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,594
form or another.
Even when I just leave the b they'll 

682
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,320
update and then they will work or you 
know,

683
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,363
I have a new computer and it's got such 
a high resolution screen that you can't 

684
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,490
use photoshop on it because he can't see
the menu items anymore.

685
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:35,770
And Adobe is known about that for a 
whole year.

686
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:36,604
It hasn't fixed it.
And so like there's all these weird 

687
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:39,154
little snakes popping up all over the 
place with something as complex as your 

688
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:42,514
computer and battling them off I think 
destroys all the potential productivity 

689
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,940
that the tool was actually designed to 
produce.

690
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,570
So I don't know if that's true or not,
but it certainly seems that way to me.

691
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,580
So.
Okay.

692
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:55,414
So the laptop,
it's a funny entity too because you can 

693
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:02,860
certainly see that it's connected 
directly to a very large network.

694
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,570
Right?
And that's the Internet clearly,

695
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,370
but partly that's an information portal,
but partly the,

696
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,860
the thing stays alive because of its 
connection to the Internet,

697
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,360
right?
It's continually updating,

698
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:14,194
it's continually being modified because 
it's plugged into something that's 

699
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:20,650
essentially a living system.
And when you think about it as a laptop,

700
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,633
you're just ignoring all of that and you
really can't because you can't ignore 

701
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:28,090
all that because it's there.
It's even more real than I kind of think

702
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:30,840
of these things like leaves on a tree,
the trees,

703
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,600
the real thing.
These are just leaves and you know,

704
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,310
they fall off and then you have to then 
and then they're dead.

705
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,080
So that's a good indication of the way 
that our perceptions deceive us.

706
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,914
And you know,
one of the things you might notice is 

707
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,033
what kind of emotional reaction do you 
have when your computer ceases to be a 

708
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:54,170
laptop while you're working on something
important?

709
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,430
What's your response?
Frustration and anger mostly.

710
00:41:58,431 --> 00:41:59,264
Yeah.
And there'll be some anxiety in that 

711
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:02,120
too.
And probably some contempt,

712
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,350
you know,
because you might say,

713
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:04,820
well,
this stupid bloody thing,

714
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:07,340
or something like that,
which is an expression of contempt,

715
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,240
which is associated with disgust and 
then there's the anxiety which is,

716
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,310
oh my God,
what am I gonna do with this now?

717
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,323
And then there's the anger and that as a
consequence of something interfering 

718
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:17,924
with your goal,
directed with your goal directed 

719
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,234
pursuit.
And so one of the things that's really 

720
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:25,670
worthwhile to note is to note that 
panoply of emotions.

721
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,300
Now there might also be a little excited
possibly because you could say,

722
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,223
oh,
well I wanted to get rid of this piece 

723
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:34,010
of junk anyways and get a new computer.
Right?

724
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:37,370
Because so when it collapses into its 
sub elements,

725
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,533
this mess of sub elements,
there's all sorts of possibilities that 

726
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:42,164
immediately arise that your nervous 
system is attuned to and the way your 

727
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,840
nervous system responds to that is it 
gets frustrated,

728
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,670
angry.
It gets afraid,

729
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,540
it gets disgusted and it gets curious 
about what's going to happen next.

730
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,670
And all of that happens at the same 
time.

731
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,923
And I would say that that response,
which is an embodied response and an 

732
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:00,764
instinctive response,
although there's cognitive elaborations 

733
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:03,344
on it,
that's the response you have when you 

734
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:06,254
actually see the actual world or as 
close as you're going to get to it 

735
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:10,064
because I don't think that you see the 
world at all until the things you're 

736
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:16,160
doing don't work,
and as soon as they don't work,

737
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:21,161
Bang you see the world now see is a 
weird way to think about that.

738
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,390
But then we could say,
well,

739
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:27,860
that's the closest you ever get to 
having contact with the thing in itself.

740
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,083
And it's very,
very stressful to have contact with the 

741
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,890
thing in itself because God only knows 
what it's going to do.

742
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,563
So your conceptual systems protect you 
from contact with reality in the same 

743
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,800
manner.
One of the things young said,

744
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,800
which I think is extraordinarily funny,
he said,

745
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:46,634
the purpose of religious systems is to 
stop people from having religious 

746
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:49,724
experiences.
It's an extraordinarily remarkable and 

747
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,624
intelligent claim because you know,
do you really want to have a religious 

748
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:58,010
experience that'll carry you into bits?
Yup.

749
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,930
Interesting encounter with things that 
are not the real world when it stops.

750
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,920
Now let's take a lot of effort.

751
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,750
Well,
think about how we do it.

752
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,180
You know,
like say say something collapses on you,

753
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:18,870
like your car breaks down.
I mean,

754
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,570
do you actually solve that problem?
Well,

755
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:25,020
generally you don't write.
What you do is you parse off the problem

756
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,150
to someone else whose knowledge about 
the multilevel reality of the automobile

757
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:32,730
is much more and differentiated than 
yours.

758
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,893
And so partly the way we deal with the 
complexity of the world is that we set 

759
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:39,570
ourselves up as a distributed 
supercomputer and we can,

760
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,120
we can call on elements of that 
supercomputing process.

761
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,510
It says at any given time to increase 
our level of resolution of the world and

762
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,353
to solve the problem,
and so partly we solve it as 

763
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:50,844
individuals,
but a huge chunk of it is that we solve 

764
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:55,090
it as a consequence of continual 
communication.

765
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:55,924
And that's also becoming increasingly 
obvious since the rise of the Internet 

766
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:01,470
because now I don't care what problem 
you have.

767
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,450
There's a high probability that someone 
somewhere merely as a consequence of the

768
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:07,284
innate altruism of human beings has put 
together an extraordinarily detailed 

769
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:11,184
video on exactly how to solve this 
little micro problem that's be said to 

770
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:15,464
you,
which is really a fascinating and an 

771
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,210
unexamined phenomenon because I'm sure 
you guys are all familiar with that.

772
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:24,360
I,
I wanted to change the stereo.

773
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,660
I have an old card.
I want to change the stereo.

774
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:31,661
So the search was how to replace a 
stereo in a 2005 Huyandai's Sonata,

775
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,773
you know,
in some guy down in the US for some 

776
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:37,590
reason,
videotaped themselves doing it.

777
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:41,910
And there it was and it's really quite 
cool that that happens because you know,

778
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:42,863
psychologists,
Sydney evolutionary psychologists and 

779
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:48,390
biologists always argue about whether 
there is such a thing as actual altruism

780
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:49,224
and you know,
it's hard not to see someone taking the 

781
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:52,644
time to post to post an observation of 
them undertaking a complex task for no 

782
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:02,160
financial reward whatsoever.
It's hard not to see that as a form of,

783
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,610
you know,
spontaneous,

784
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:04,890
old truism.
It's very,

785
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:05,980
very cool.
Yeah.

786
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,693
Happens with people that are really 
anxious or something like little things 

787
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,570
abstract and it seems like the whole 
world.

788
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah.
Well we'll get.

789
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,713
We'll get to the relationship between 
your conceptual systems and how things 

790
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,980
fall apart here right away.
So.

791
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:25,923
All right,
so I've run you through a couple of 

792
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:30,320
examples of the complexity that you're 
faced with that's invisible.

793
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:34,640
That's the thing that's really most 
worth considering is that your stability

794
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:37,880
is dependent on the maintenance of a 
million conditions.

795
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,483
The maintenance of a million conditions 
that could go wrong at any particular 

796
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,260
time,
but generally don't,

797
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,640
at least not in a functioning society.
All right,

798
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,743
so

799
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,623
I will look at this.
So I mentioned frames of reference and 

800
00:46:57,011 --> 00:46:57,844
so you cannot look at the world without 
a frame of reference and the reason you 

801
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:04,480
can't do that is because it's too 
complex to see.

802
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,730
So that means that a frame of reference 
is actually a pro,

803
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,350
a necessity for perception itself,
which is quite interesting.

804
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:15,430
So you cannot perceive it all unless you
perceive locally and pragmatically.

805
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,950
That's what it looks like.
And then you might ask yourself,

806
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,960
well what are these frames of reference?
Look like,

807
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:20,943
and this is where I think neuro 
psychology and cognitive science meets 

808
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:25,774
narrative psychology and psychoanalysis 
because I think this just as the 

809
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,790
smallest units of your semi robotic 
subsystems,

810
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,500
the ones you share with animals,
our personality,

811
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:39,334
like when they manifest themselves,
so the concepts that you use to build 

812
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:48,960
the frame of reference that you orient 
yourself with our narrative like because

813
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:49,803
you can say,
well,

814
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,740
what's a narrative?

815
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,910
And the answer to that is it's a 
description of a personality inaction.

816
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,983
That's what a narrative is.
And so if the actual problem solving 

817
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:06,601
subcomponents of your psyche are 
subpersonalities,

818
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:11,761
then the description of those is going 
to be basic narratives.

819
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,083
And so the hypothesis here is that 
because we're tremendously imitative 

820
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:18,610
creatures,
first of all,

821
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,444
I can poll your personality out of you 
at any given time by just watching what 

822
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:25,900
you do and matching it with my body and 
we're doing that all the time.

823
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:30,901
If you're a reasonably social person and
you're talking to someone one on one,

824
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,390
you're going to match your behavior to 
theirs and all sorts of ways.

825
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,253
I mean,
one of the experiments we did once was 

826
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:39,610
we brought undergraduates into the lab 
and we just put like a,

827
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,043
you know,
a bowl of chips between them and 

828
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,450
basically what we found is that each of 
the undergraduates,

829
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:49,330
eight exactly the same amount of chips 
as the other.

830
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,403
So sometimes a dyad would settle into no
chips and so neither of them would eat 

831
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:54,454
anything.
And then another dyad would settle 

832
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:58,360
somehow into,
well we'll eat all the chips and so then

833
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:01,510
each of them would eat half and the 
correlation was like point nine.

834
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,030
It was unbelievable and these were 
strangers you know.

835
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:07,660
And so you're mirroring the other 
person's embodiment,

836
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:08,883
like a mad dog all the time and it's a 
great thing to be able to do because it 

837
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,084
means that you can,
you can unite your being within the 

838
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,970
same,
within the same locale.

839
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,750
And that means you don't have to have 
conflict.

840
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,793
Plus it also means that you can learn 
very rapidly from someone else just by 

841
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,730
doing what they're doing.
I don't know if you guys have seen this,

842
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,060
but there's computers now that,
that take advantage of this idea.

843
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:33,400
And so what happens is like,
let's say you have a computer,

844
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:36,610
that it's a robot and you want it to do 
this task.

845
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,980
So pick something up here,
move it up here,

846
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,903
pull it over here and put it down.
All you do is you take the robot's arm 

847
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,520
and you put it down and you close it and
then you lift it up and you move it over

848
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:49,354
and down.
And then the robot would do it by 

849
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,220
itself.
And so that's,

850
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,103
you know,
that's the beginnings of robotic 

851
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:56,200
imitation.
And that's actually real.

852
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,380
Imitation is mind boggling because once 
it kicks in,

853
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:00,843
as soon as one thing learned something,
then all the other things that are 

854
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:03,754
exactly like it can learn something.
And so what I think will happen in the 

855
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,294
next five years is we'll finally get 
robots that are fairly autonomous and 

856
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:11,320
they're really,
man,

857
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:14,770
they're really on their way.
And then we'll get ones that are good at

858
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:17,050
imitating each other and then the thing 
will just explode.

859
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:17,883
Because if there's a.
say there's say there's 10 million of 

860
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,960
those robots that are reasonably 
complex.

861
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,330
Then as soon as one of them learns 
anything,

862
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:29,990
all the other ones will immediately know
it and while that's not,

863
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,113
that's.
That's exponential growth on a scale 

864
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:35,300
that we can't even imagine and that's 
coming very,

865
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:36,500
very rapidly.
But anyways,

866
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,440
you already do that and that's part of 
the reason people are so damn smart.

867
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,783
But then you're also capable of a 
different kind of invitation and that 

868
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:43,844
invitation is when I watched myself do 
something and then I formulated into a 

869
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:53,090
concept and then I tell you the concept 
and you decompose it so that you can use

870
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,924
it in your own body.
And that's basically what we're doing 

871
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:56,084
when we're telling stories.
So now it's kind of low resolution 

872
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,950
communication,
but it doesn't matter.

873
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,670
It's unbelievably powerful communication
and as far as I can tell,

874
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:07,640
the basic unit of that narrative or that
frame of reference,

875
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:08,474
is this your somewhere because you are 
localized in time and space and that 

876
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:14,570
isn't as good as it could be for one 
reason or another.

877
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,403
So you're trying to improve it and then 
you have some notions about what you 

878
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:23,570
have to do in order to improve it.
And you act them out,

879
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,583
you implement them and I think you're 
doing that all the time and I can't see 

880
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,084
how you can not do it because you have 
to have a technique for simplifying the 

881
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,610
world.
And so as far as I can tell,

882
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:35,444
this is the technique and so a basic 
story was while I was here and then I 

883
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,090
went there and that was better and 
here's how I did it.

884
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,610
And so that's a pretty good story.
It's not great,

885
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,444
but it's good enough.
You might listen to that or you might 

886
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,370
watch it as a on a video like I did when
I was trying to figure out how to fix my

887
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:50,810
car stereo.
Right?

888
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,510
So it's a story about how to fix a car 
stereo.

889
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,370
And you might say,
well that's not a very good story.

890
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,860
It's like I didn't say it was a very 
good story.

891
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,143
I said it was the basic element of 
perception and also of narrative 

892
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,360
communication.
And,

893
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:07,490
and to make that,
those two things,

894
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,324
united is a tremendously exciting 
possibility because one of the things 

895
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:12,920
that you may have noted about 
psychology,

896
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,530
this is something we talked a lot about 
in my personality class,

897
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:19,820
is that there's a real disjunction 
between narrative psychology,

898
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,960
which generally tends to be by 
psychoanalytic and,

899
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,070
and neuroscience,
for example,

900
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,410
and psychometrics,
which tend to be,

901
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,890
while they're not narrative anyways,
you know,

902
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:30,724
they,
that we haven't been able to bridge the 

903
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:32,804
gap.
And so part of the reason I'm telling 

904
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:35,534
you,
the things I'm telling you right now is 

905
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:41,290
so that you can bridge the gap.
So an so an opt out of this.

906
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:46,421
And that's when we go to this next,
this next diagram here.

907
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,760
Sorry,
I have so many diagrams.

908
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:06,761
It's hard to keep track of the monsters.
Yeah,

909
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,063
this one.

910
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,620
Okay,
now you've seen this before,

911
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:19,500
but I want to walk through it again 
because it's important and it's,

912
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:20,560
it,
it,

913
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,393
it allows you to do a 
reconceptualization that unites things 

914
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:27,660
that can't otherwise be united.
So the one of the issues might be,

915
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,620
well,
what is an abstraction composed of?

916
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,790
And I would say,
well,

917
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:36,780
it depends on the domain in which the 
abstraction is being implemented.

918
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,614
So an abstraction about the world is 
slightly different than an abstraction 

919
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,740
about you.
I think what they have in common is that

920
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:46,230
when you make abstract representations 
of the world,

921
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:51,060
you're making abstract representations 
of the world as a place to act.

922
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,763
And that's a critically important thing 
to understand because we're scientific 

923
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,680
in our explicit cognitive 
presuppositions.

924
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,753
We think that world models our world,
our models of the world as a place of 

925
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,283
things.
So we're kind of taking a page from St 

926
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:06,720
Augustine.

927
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,553
In some sense the world is made out of 
objectively existing independent 

928
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:15,420
material entities.
And when you develop understanding about

929
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:16,254
the world,
what you're doing is producing a map of 

930
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,900
those entities.
And the thing is that's true in a narrow

931
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:24,690
sense in that that is what you're doing 
when you're doing science,

932
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,703
but science itself is nested inside of 
narrative structure as we talked about 

933
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,304
before.
So then the question is what's the 

934
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,930
nature of the more comprehensive 
narrative structure?

935
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,450
And I don't think that you can 
understand,

936
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,550
you cannot understand profound 
narratives unless you understand this,

937
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:42,661
this,
this,

938
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:43,920
underlying,
these,

939
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:49,090
this underlying set of assumptions.
You're not naturally predisposed to view

940
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,664
the world in objective terms.
Now we talked about that from a 

941
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:55,350
Darwinian,
the Newtonian point of view last time.

942
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,270
So when I told you what I thought about 
that,

943
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:58,830
but here's,
here's the idea,

944
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,560
you know,
so let's say we'll talk about the domain

945
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:02,310
of morality.

946
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,143
And the reason that I put this under the
debate of morality is because it has to 

947
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,540
do with how you do act and how you 
should act.

948
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,673
So that's a moral domain.
And then I would say most of the time 

949
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:18,090
when we're communicating information 
that we find relevant to one another,

950
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:18,924
what we're communicating is moral 
inflammation and the moral information 

951
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:25,530
is how to perceive and act in the world 
such that things work.

952
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,380
Now obviously you can have a debate 
about what those things are,

953
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:30,150
but that's still what we're trying to 
do.

954
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,270
And you can debate about what work means
and so on and so forth.

955
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:35,220
And we're doing that all the time 
because it's complex.

956
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,960
So if I say,
well,

957
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,030
you're a good person,
then we could unpack that.

958
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:42,571
I could say,
okay,

959
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:44,970
well what are the snakes inside being a 
good person?

960
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,290
And we can say,
well that's a higher.

961
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,123
It's actually good person is a 
representation of a complex hierarchy 

962
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,830
and so I've outlined some of the 
hierarchy here.

963
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,980
If you're a good person,
one element of being a good person,

964
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,933
although maybe not a necessary element,
but one element is that you're a good 

965
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:00,924
parent and then a sub element of that is
that you can take care of your family 

966
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,540
and Isabell.
An element of that might be that you can

967
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:09,240
play with the baby or that you could 
cook a meal.

968
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,460
Now you don't have to hit a home run on 
every single one of the constituents,

969
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:17,790
sub elements of the entire category in 
order to qualify as a good person,

970
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,970
but you can see that there's a shared 
structure.

971
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,833
You know that people recognize that's 
characteristic of a good person that's 

972
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:26,614
actually composed of action patterns and
perceptions has nothing to do in some 

973
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:31,480
sense with the objective world.

974
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,250
It's a completely different way of 
looking at it.

975
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:36,400
So if you're going to play with the baby
while then you think,

976
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:37,234
well,
what do you have to do to play with the 

977
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,700
baby?
And so you know,

978
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:40,534
we might make a goofy face out the baby 
because babies respond to that sort of 

979
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,040
thing.
Sometimes by crying,

980
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,560
but often by smiling you can tickle 
their feet.

981
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:50,050
You can kind of poke them,
you can play with their arms,

982
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:51,790
you know,
you can rock them back and forth.

983
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:55,360
There's and you watch the baby.
So you find out if it's having fun too.

984
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:56,194
And now the thing that's interesting 
about actually playing with the baby is 

985
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,780
that the,
the,

986
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,390
the phenomena that you're manifesting is
no longer abstract and conceptual.

987
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,883
It's embodied play,
decomposes into movement patterns of 

988
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:13,960
movements like a dance.
In fact,

989
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:14,794
if you take a mother and she's getting 
along with her baby and you videotape 

990
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,490
them interacting,
what you see is that the mothers who get

991
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:22,324
along with their baby are doing a dance 
with them and the baby is harmonized 

992
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:26,030
with the mother.

993
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,390
So there's this sort of melodic and 
fluid dance.

994
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:31,360
Whereas the baby that's not getting 
along with its mother,

995
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:32,194
it's more like having a conversation 
with someone who disagrees with 

996
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:37,330
absolutely everything that you say in 
random ways.

997
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,523
No.
So you start off an invitation to the 

998
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:42,760
conversation and they nail you with a 
non sequitur,

999
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,653
so that's a nonstarter and then you try 
it again and they nail you with 

1000
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:46,834
something else that seems completely 
irrelevant and and so it's Jerky and 

1001
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,670
discontinuous and you see that with 
people interacting with children all the

1002
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:55,504
time.
I think that's part of the reason why 

1003
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:00,370
people use dance as a mating strategy.
It's like,

1004
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,650
you know,
is this person capable of mutual,

1005
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:08,830
harmonious imitation?
Now it's not a perfect test,

1006
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:09,664
but

1007
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:12,940
it's not too bad.
It's got.

1008
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:16,450
It's got some utility and it's so the 
abstraction,

1009
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,110
the abstract narrative representation.
You're a good person.

1010
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,660
That is not an objective category.
The,

1011
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,450
the abstract representation.
You're a good person,

1012
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,510
decomposes at the highest level of 
resolution into a sequence of actions,

1013
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,200
and piaget,
for example,

1014
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,034
would say that while you learn those 
basic actions as you're putting your 

1015
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:38,950
nervous system together from,
from birth until now,

1016
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,070
so you're building yourself up at the 
bottom because so when you dance,

1017
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,023
you know there's certain movements you 
have to make and those are movements 

1018
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:47,980
that you could make in other 
circumstances that would also be useful.

1019
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,590
And so you're for,
for piaget,

1020
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:53,740
you build yourself from the bottom of 
this hierarchy towards the top.

1021
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,023
Okay?
So then,

1022
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,060
you know,
one of the things that you might note is

1023
00:58:58,061 --> 00:58:58,894
that as you go up the chain of 
abstraction arguments about what those 

1024
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:04,330
categories contained become more and 
more likely,

1025
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,730
you know,
and so you might say for example,

1026
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,650
to your,
to your,

1027
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:14,010
to your mate,
that being able to

1028
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:17,643
prepare a decent meal is such an 
important sub element of being a good 

1029
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:23,270
person.
That if you fail to do it or can't,

1030
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:24,104
that actually means you're a bad person 
and you can see right away why that 

1031
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,034
would provoke all sorts of arguments.
And so part of the reason that I'm 

1032
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,680
bringing this up is because we're 
always,

1033
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,533
we're engaged in a constant process of 
mutual exploration to determine how 

1034
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:45,131
these hierarchies are properly arranged 
and what are necessary sub categories of

1035
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,154
them and how those subcategories shoe 
should be hierarchically instantiated 

1036
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:50,354
with regards to one another and we have 
to have some agreement about that or we 

1037
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:55,450
actually can't communicate.
So like if,

1038
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,260
if my stance is you burn the vegetables,
you're a bad person and your stances,

1039
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:02,900
I burned the vegetables and who the hell
cares about that?

1040
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,973
Then the fact that our hierarchies of 
values are structured completely 

1041
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:07,724
differently means we're gonna have a 
very difficult time communicating and 

1042
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:10,724
there's going to be a lot of conflict 
about how that conceptual structure 

1043
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:14,810
should be reorganized.

1044
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:15,943
And that's actually what you're doing 
when you're arguing with someone about 

1045
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,300
something important.
It's like you're trying to say,

1046
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,134
okay,
we need to get our hierarchies are 

1047
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:27,620
narrative,
hierarchy succinct so that what you want

1048
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:29,690
and what I want can happen at the same 
time.

1049
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,250
And so that we understand each other.
And we can partly do that by talking.

1050
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,633
Um,
we can also do it by suppressing the 

1051
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:38,624
other person,
which we tend to do an awful lot or 

1052
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:43,580
suppressing ourselves in favor of the 
other person and so forth and so on.

1053
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:45,410
But the thing is there's that,
that,

1054
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,120
those,
those places have known agreement are,

1055
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,410
are like,
they're like tunnels into a,

1056
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,840
the complex underlying reality that we 
have to deal with and places where the,

1057
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,580
the nature of that,

1058
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,090
the nature of the complexity of dealing 
with that become apparent.

1059
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,060
And part of what happens as a 
consequence of that is people just don't

1060
01:01:09,061 --> 01:01:11,490
have those discussions.
They don't know how to do it.

1061
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:14,080
They can't decompose the situation.
You know,

1062
01:01:14,081 --> 01:01:16,590
and I can give you an example of that 
which you're going to face.

1063
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,113
Let's say you're in a family,
you're married to someone or whatever 

1064
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:21,564
the equivalent happens to be.
You both have a career whose career is 

1065
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:26,580
more important,
you think,

1066
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:27,301
well,
it doesn't matter.

1067
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:28,134
It's like it matters because there will 
be times when you have to make a choice 

1068
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,650
between the two career paths.
It's like,

1069
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:35,790
okay,
well how do you do that?

1070
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:39,270
And the answer to that is you don't know
and neither does anyone else,

1071
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:40,223
and worse,
there are no rules for having a 

1072
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:42,654
discussion.
You have to come up with all the rules 

1073
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:44,964
and everything about the discussion 
because you can't even tell when you're 

1074
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:48,070
being reasonable,
you know,

1075
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,170
because you might say,
well,

1076
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,490
the person who makes the most money,
their careers,

1077
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,343
the most important,

1078
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,443
it's like

1079
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,540
you are you going to accept that?
What do you think that's valid?

1080
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:58,980
And if you don't,
okay,

1081
01:01:58,981 --> 01:01:59,814
fine,
what are you going to use it as an 

1082
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,620
alternative criteria?

1083
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,490
It's very,
very difficult.

1084
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,990
It's very,
very difficult.

1085
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,410
You know when most of the way we solve 
this as collectives,

1086
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:14,411
as we have standard hierarchies of 
narratives that we just all adopt.

1087
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,420
That's the our,
our identity with our history.

1088
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:18,254
That's a role.
If you adopt your role in mine and my 

1089
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:22,284
hierarchy is structured to take your 
role into account and the reverse is 

1090
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:27,000
also true.
We don't have to have a conflict.

1091
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,170
Now you might have a conflict as an 
individual with your role.

1092
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,500
That's a whole different story.
But if you pop out of your role,

1093
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,334
and I pop out of mine,
were in no man's land and in no man's 

1094
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,200
land,
three things happen.

1095
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,200
Tyranny,
slavery,

1096
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,680
or negotiation.
And most people can't negotiate.

1097
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,230
And the reason for that is it's too damn
complicated.

1098
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,843
What time is it?

1099
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,793
10 after two?

1100
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,420
Yes.
Let's take a break.

1101
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,200
Okay.
For,

1102
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,820
for,
for 15 minutes.
