1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,750
Okay.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,160
Okay.
So I'm going to show you guys,

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:05,994
yeah,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,800
totally relevant.
Everyone here.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,380
Um,
for future offering,

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,680
can we still send it to Christine 
because she's not here?

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,740
I can't ask her that.
Assuming the best.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,280
Okay.
Okay.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,540
No,
if we should send it,

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,113
I will as soon as I find out,
but I suspect that things will go on as 

11
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:35,530
normal.
So just do what we've been doing.

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,690
That's the theory

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
factors yesterday,
I think.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,040
Yeah.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,980
Yeah.
I don't think she is.

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,003
Yeah.
Yeah.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,433
Can you be on strike you like shame on 
you for being straight cause you're not 

18
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:02,320
here.
I just feel like,

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,290
yeah.
I'm just wondering,

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,540
could you be on strike if you're pointed
to another?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,320
Well they're near on a virtual strike.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,060
What's that?
What's that office.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,310
Okay,
well I'll,

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,633
should we sign all the stupid things.
I can't send her the damn essays and 

25
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,940
we'll see what happens or in the future 
or three stuff.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
Eventually they're going to get graded.
If they don't,

27
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,730
I will figure out what to do about it.
You're not going to be left hanging with

28
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,110
this course.
Okay,

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,480
so just do the word,
do the work.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,690
We'll figure out how you get your damn 
credit.

31
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,524
I'm going to do everything I can so that
you're not left hanging because I don't 

32
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,380
think that's reasonable.
You know,

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,090
did the beef isn't with you guys.
So,

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,490
um,
so don't worry about it for now.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,580
Just proceed as if everything will be 
worked out.

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,710
Okay.
Okay.

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,693
Okay.
So I want to show you some images and 

38
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,450
these are great farther images 
fundamentally.

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,313
And I want you to take a look at them 
because they're powerful propaganda 

40
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,150
images and we want to see what they 
represent.

41
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,450
So on the right,
you see Hitler there?

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,610
Who's taking over from,

43
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,650
yeah,

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,870
Hindenburg I believe that's right.

45
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,403
Okay.

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,080
I can't remember.
He was the president before Hitler came,

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,920
came aboard.
And so you see that there's the transfer

48
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,700
of power from the wise old man to the,
to the emergent hero.

49
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,250
That's the image on the left.
Right?

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,580
And so then on the right,
well,

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,100
so what do you think about that picture?
What does it represent?

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,370
What's going on there?
What's that?

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah,
we'll just look at,

54
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,500
just look at the image.

55
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,570
I think it's the balance of representing
the big order,

56
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:02,380
the balance between tyranny.
MMM

57
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,120
turney and security,
security.

58
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,660
It's the balance be doing all the Cyrus 
and horace,

59
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,880
right?
It's different than that.

60
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,560
That's close.
But you know,

61
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,561
it's a call to heroism from the youth 
with the father who's far seeing and you

62
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,024
know,
composed serving as the protector and 

63
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,564
the model.

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,173
So.
Yup.

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,950
No,
that's your sort of ideal area in youth.

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
Yeah,
and it's an interesting picture,

67
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,414
a because it's,
it's actually a picture that represents 

68
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:43,230
a child in a way that you very seldom 
see children represented.

69
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,623
You know,
because the child is very serious and 

70
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,524
determined and you know,
that's not an acceptable image of a 

71
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:50,274
child.
Generally speaking in a culture that's 

72
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,173
optimistic and naive because the kids 
are always like their little innocent 

73
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,470
things that have no power.
It's like that's wrong.

74
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,520
Yes,
definitely.

75
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,301
Oh,
definitely.

76
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:06,720
He's a great father.
He's the all seeing great farther in the

77
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:07,554
background.
He's like the wizard of Oz 

78
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,480
fundamentally.
You know?

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,070
So,
yeah.

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,620
Yeah.
So these partly order,

81
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,830
and that was a huge part of Hitler,
and that's partly was attractive because

82
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:17,664
Germany was absolutely in chaos.
So that made order more and more 

83
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,470
attractive.
Right?

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,750
So when Hitler was a very orderly 
person,

85
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,303
so

86
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,790
and so what does that mean?
Why would that be the case?

87
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,090
That's right.
Right.

88
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,490
So,
so that means they're above you.

89
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,980
You're looking up at an ideal.
Right.

90
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,440
And that's because they're in the 
dominance hierarchy.

91
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,840
You're kneeling,
that's another way of thinking about it.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Yes.
There are also lift from above.

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,193
Yes.
And it's far seeing right there looking 

94
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,490
far ahead into the future.
That's right.

95
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,740
That's good.
All right.

96
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:05,160
So then there's the picture on the left.
So what do you think about that?

97
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,070
Yeah.

98
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,880
Oh,
well,

99
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,713
maybe I can make it a little bit bigger.
What you have is Hitler on the right of 

100
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:15,980
the picture in the left,
and then a huge number of people crowded

101
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:19,760
around him and they're all smiling and,
and joyful.

102
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,190
And so that's a representation of Hitler
as the jovial farther of the race.

103
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,840
Right?
And you'll see it set at a,

104
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,660
at a table.
And what do people do at a table?

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah,

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,580
that's right.
And they share it.

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,010
Right.
And so that's a very familial,

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,670
um,
that's a very familial enterprise.

109
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,270
And to share food with someone is to 
bring them into your house.

110
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,104
Right.
And to be the distributor of food is to 

111
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,370
be the benevolent father.
And then on the right,

112
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,710
you see Hitler addressing,
um,

113
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,920
I large political crowd.
You know,

114
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:55,740
he's up on a high platform with his men 
behind him,

115
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:56,574
and then these,
these eagles carrying the swastika sort 

116
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,340
of arrayed behind him.
So he's up again.

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,773
So very good at theatrically.
The Nazis were very good at using 

118
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
theatrical.
Yeah.

119
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,450
So then you see him on the left there.
What do you think about that picture?

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,960
Yeah,
it's Stoic and resolute,

121
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,830
right?
Yeah,

122
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,060
exactly.
Okay.

123
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,680
And then you have the middle picture 
where the Germans are basically marching

124
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,890
with what are really remade Roman 
banners,

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,440
you know?
And so what do you,

126
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,690
what do you,
what does that image show

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,793
very?

128
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,650
Yes,
that's exactly right.

129
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,484
It shows uniformity and solidarity and 
the uniformity comes out because 

130
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,550
everyone's the same.
Right?

131
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,370
And that makes them a powerful united 
force.

132
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,070
Now you might ask yourself,
well,

133
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,760
why would people want that?
And so what's the answer to that

134
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,830
and power,
I mean,

135
00:06:58,831 --> 00:06:59,664
you want to be part of a,
like a powerful united force or do you 

136
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,010
want to be like the weak member of an if
completely fragmented society,

137
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
you know,
so now you might say,

138
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:15,000
well I don't want to be too integrated,
but you know,

139
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,834
one thing I would say is don't 
overestimate the degree to which you 

140
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,610
don't want to be too integrated.
Cause you know,

141
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,650
modern people,
especially in the west,

142
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,720
they like to think of themselves as 
individuals.

143
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,450
It's like I have a hypothesis about 
that.

144
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,120
I think people in the West are actually 
the most conforming people in the entire

145
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:33,954
world.

146
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,900
Okay.

147
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,733
And that's why they can sort of dance 
around on top of that pr like they're 

148
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,484
free.
And the reason is everyone stops at the 

149
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:44,410
red lights,
you know,

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,393
everyone obeys everything virtually.
And so you can dress weirdly and maybe 

151
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:50,764
you can have a bizarre opinion and you 
can go off and do something that's a 

152
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,360
little out of the ordinary in some 
corner,

153
00:07:55,361 --> 00:08:00,361
but 99% of the time you're a conformist 
right to the damn bone.

154
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,700
And that's a good thing because if you 
weren't,

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,790
the society wouldn't be so stable and so
predictable across,

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,190
you know,
reasonable spans of time.

157
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,903
So,
but the idea that the west is 

158
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:12,754
individualistic,
it's like we might represent 

159
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:15,004
individualism as a form of daddy and 
aspire to it and we might even worship 

160
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:21,880
it when it occurs because we do with 
celebrities and so forth.

161
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,043
But that's by boat.
By no means reasonable to assume that 

162
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,880
the west is primarily individualistic.

163
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,470
You know,
I mean,

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,420
I grew up in western Canada and in 
Edmonton,

165
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:35,254
if there's a light that's red,
like if you know you're supposed to not 

166
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:38,794
walk,
people will stand there on the street 

167
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:45,310
when it's 40 below and wait until the 
light changes.

168
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,400
Even if they can't see your car anywhere
near in any direction.

169
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,980
Like it was quite shocking to me when I 
first moved to Montreal.

170
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,780
And people were Jay walking,
you know,

171
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:56,190
I thought God himself was going to 
strike me down with if I did it.

172
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,253
You know,
now that the roads are narrow and so 

173
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,300
that's part of it.
But,

174
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,163
but montrealers there's definitely a lot
pushier as pedestrians than people in 

175
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,514
the west.
And the other thing that's quite 

176
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:07,494
interesting about the west traffic 
patterns is that if you're standing on 

177
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,260
the road looking like you might want to 
cross,

178
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,290
even if it's Jay walk and get a little 
stop and let you cross,

179
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,270
it's quite annoying because you just 
standing there and it's like,

180
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,523
you know,
five people stop and then you have to 

181
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,670
walk across the street just not to 
disappoint them.

182
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,660
So you know,
the thing about conformity is it is it,

183
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,750
it makes for a tremendous amount of 
stability.

184
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,913
And believe me,
we wouldn't be promoting nonconformity 

185
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,040
if everyone was nonconforming.
We'd be thinking,

186
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,874
Hey,
it's time to get this whole thing 

187
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:41,430
conforming quite,
quite tightly.

188
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,790
One of the things I'd been thinking 
about Islam lately is that,

189
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,190
you know,
when,

190
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,380
when you,
when you wanted to find a religion,

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,220
we determine is a religion religion of 
peace or of,

192
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,660
of war.
And you think,

193
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,360
well it might depend on the level of 
analysis.

194
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,194
You know,
one of the things that Islam did was 

195
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,714
take a society that was very tribal and 
fractious and united across a large 

196
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
portion of territory.
So you know what,

197
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:10,914
it did that by expanding its domains and
incorporating other people and also 

198
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:14,994
going to war.
So on the fringes of the Islamic 

199
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,114
expansion,
there was all sorts of bloodshed and 

200
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,724
misery.

201
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,120
But then inside it,
there was this hierarchical organization

202
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:24,954
of people that were basically only 
organized into little bitty tribal 

203
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,180
groups before that.
So you might say,

204
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,014
well,
that within the expanding bubble of 

205
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,950
influence,
it was peaceful.

206
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:38,340
And then on the fringes it was violent.
And then you might say,

207
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,050
well,
what does that mean over the long run?

208
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,884
Is that warlike or peaceful?
And I don't really know how to answer 

209
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,240
that question,
you know,

210
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,760
because it depends on which angle you're
looking at it from.

211
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,313
You know,
we certainly know that as humanity 

212
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,020
aggregated itself into a larger and 
larger collectives,

213
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,370
there was a lot of conflict that had to 
be had in order for that to occur.

214
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,950
But the consequence,
like you think about our,

215
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,370
our lives at the moment,
the probability that one of you will get

216
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,080
killed by a homicide is,
you know,

217
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,430
it's vanishingly low.
And then you might ask yourself,

218
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,560
well,
how much bloodshed and conflict did that

219
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:16,140
take in?
Oh,

220
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:20,070
before everyone was hammered together so
damn tightly that well,

221
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,233
here's another way of looking at it.
Why is it possible for women to have 

222
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,670
rights in the West?

223
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,120
Yeah,

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,710
I think the answer to that is because 
they can go outside without being raped.

225
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,663
So you know,
the whole culture is so damn peaceful 

226
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:41,071
now that it's a woman can present 
herself alone,

227
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,390
two strange men and not die as a 
consequence of it.

228
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,591
It's like,
okay,

229
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,570
well then you can start talking about 
rights.

230
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,770
It's before that.
It's

231
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,250
whatever

232
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,080
you're talking about.
It's not right.

233
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,630
Mostly what it is is protection.
You know,

234
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,464
you have to be protected.
And there's lots of places in the world 

235
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,970
where that's still exactly the way it 
is.

236
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,373
You know?
I know that even when I was traveling 

237
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,910
through Europe years ago,
when the eighties you know,

238
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,810
I traveled with a friend of mine,
a woman and her boyfriend,

239
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,960
and when we went through Italy for 
example,

240
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,063
she was blonde.
She was just harassed to death by the 

241
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,370
Italian men.
I mean,

242
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,810
not in any,
not in any way.

243
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,170
That was brutal.
I'm sure it does.

244
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm sure it does.
So we took her over to Greece as well,

245
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,173
and we went to this place called Patras 
and patches had this absolutely weird 

246
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,980
celebration that was like the fourth 
biggest celebration in the world.

247
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:39,814
I'd never even heard of it.
And one of the things they do there is 

248
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,330
everybody goes on the street with these 
plastic bats,

249
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,860
you know,
they're really light plastic.

250
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,350
Pat's the kinds kid would use.
And they were like this big round.

251
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:53,080
They're plastic was firm enough so that 
it was a bat,

252
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:53,914
but soft enough.
So if you go whack with it in a semi 

253
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:58,300
playful way,
it wasn't going to hurt.

254
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,360
And then everybody also spraying each 
other with silly string,

255
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,610
which I thought was an extremely 
bizarre,

256
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,683
I mean that stuff was not old.
So like there's a million people out in 

257
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,474
the street and everybody's hitting each 
other with bats and spraying each other 

258
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,700
with silly string.
And this poor girl,

259
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,160
she must be hit like 10,000
times,

260
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,510
you know,
so,

261
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,050
and it wasn't malevolent.
It was playful,

262
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,891
you know,
it had to be,

263
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,170
because when everyone's hitting 
everybody else with bats,

264
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,300
it bloody well better state playful,
right?

265
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,163
But the pro,
the thing is is that she couldn't move 

266
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,350
with anywhere near the same freedom that
I could move.

267
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,753
And that's only a tiny,
tiny echo of what it would have been 

268
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:42,610
like in many places 500 years ago or a 
thousand years ago.

269
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,200
So again,
you know,

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,393
there's this basis of absolute 
conformity that's a prerequisite to as 

271
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,474
freedom,
especially freedom for people who are 

272
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,323
vulnerable in many ways.
So that's part of what's being 

273
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,730
celebrated in that image.
And you know,

274
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,564
if people are in the state of chaos,
that's one thing that really attracts 

275
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,220
them.
They're attracted by order.

276
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,870
And so,
you know,

277
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,000
you always have to give the devil his 
due.

278
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:10,020
If you're trying to understand something
like not see as it,

279
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,770
you have to understand why it might be 
attractive to someone like you.

280
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Now the question is in part,
why did it go so pathologically wrong?

281
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,980
Well that's part of what we're going to 
untangle,

282
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,120
you know,
because you might say,

283
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,720
well you might have benevolent motives 
in establishing order,

284
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,590
but order shades into tyranny and then 
your,

285
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,483
your,
your motivations for establishing 

286
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:39,490
tyranny might be completely self serving
and cruel.

287
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,623
You know,
there may be a process that gets you to 

288
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,370
self serving and cruel certainly is what
happened with the Nazis.

289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,890
And the question is,
was that they're all along.

290
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:50,890
Was it something that emerged?
Was it like the snake in the garden that

291
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,630
was going to present itself?
Well,

292
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,210
and you have Hitler on,
on the right there.

293
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:00,080
And that's a Nazi art statue behind it.
And you know,

294
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,900
it's kind of got this quasi Greek 
element,

295
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,913
although,
and the Hitler was an admirer of 

296
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,004
classical statuary,
but then everything's exaggerated about 

297
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,920
it.
There's this sort of hyper masculine,

298
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,953
well it's like hyper masculinize Greek 
sculpture that was the part of the Nazi 

299
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,794
aesthetic.

300
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,580
So that one on the left says one folk,
one country,

301
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,590
one leader.
That's what fear means,

302
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:32,424
you know?
And so there you see that Hitler's head 

303
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,380
is assimilated to the idea of a country,
right?

304
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:38,214
So it says this is,
there's something about this country 

305
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:44,610
that's Hitler's hand.
So like you might think,

306
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,180
do you ever use symbols like that?
And the answer is,

307
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,014
well,
it's sure every time you give someone a 

308
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:51,660
coin,
right?

309
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,810
So Hitler's head is like the head of the
realm.

310
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,680
And so what does that mean in,
in some sense it means that the realm is

311
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:02,520
an embodiment of Hitler or it's an 
embodiment of the leader.

312
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,473
And actually around me is the embodiment
of the leader because it's a body of 

313
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:07,134
laws.
And so what it represents is a mode of 

314
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,980
being.
And so that's what that expresses.

315
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,220
And then you have him on the left there 
and you know,

316
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,233
you can kind of see what sort of 
emotions he thought were morally 

317
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,480
appropriate.
And so it's almost a career teacher,

318
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,314
except there's about,
there's an element of seriousness about 

319
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,780
it that's that that stops it from being 
a caricatured.

320
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,020
And so what do you have to say about 
that picture on the right?

321
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,070
What does that say to you?

322
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Yeah,
yeah.

323
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,060
So those are all positive things so far 
aren't they?

324
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:47,894
Could be argued to be that.
You see anything that isn't like that 

325
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,210
there's some disdain.
Yeah,

326
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,410
that's right.
Who said that?

327
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,300
Yeah.
It seems,

328
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,830
I agree.
There's some disdain.

329
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:01,100
It's partly the narrowed eyebrows.
It's partly the fact that his face is up

330
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:05,060
a little bit and disdain is associated 
with contempt and disgust.

331
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,163
Yeah.
And so I would also say there was some 

332
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:10,550
arrogance in that.
Partly it's the sideways pose,

333
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,070
you know,
cause it's a real pose.

334
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,423
And so

335
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,410
I'd almost say I looked at it and I 
think you almost answered that.

336
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,050
Normally he kind of touches ugly,
scary.

337
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,560
But this one's almost like timid little 
boy.

338
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,413
I grew up,

339
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,380
well I think one of the things that I 
think you can see in the picture is over

340
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,400
compensation.
You know,

341
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:44,401
because you shouldn't be any more 
dominant that is necessary,

342
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,413
but you really have to be well put 
together not to be more dominant is 

343
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,124
necessary.
And I think the dominance is a 

344
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:56,841
compensation at least in part for 
childhood inadequacy and weakness.

345
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,090
That was actually one of the central 
axioms of Adler Adlerian theory.

346
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,503
You know,
that what people were doing as they 

347
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,214
progressed towards adulthood was 
compensating for the inferiority of 

348
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,020
their childhood.
You know,

349
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,080
and he said they'd often overcompensate 
and you know,

350
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,943
if you watch your own behavior you will,
you could see that happening all the 

351
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,540
time.
Happens all the time.

352
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,940
It's extraordinarily difficult not to 
push any harder than you have to win.

353
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,803
Sometimes it's because you're trying to 
look better than you are tougher than 

354
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,210
you are.

355
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,043
And I think there is an element that you
can see in that cause it's like it's a 

356
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,880
bit too much,
you know?

357
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:33,714
And I would also say,
one of the things I've noticed about 

358
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:36,684
people who have really mastered 
something is that they can do it with a 

359
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:42,330
touch of humor,
even if it's really serious.

360
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,673
You know,
and I had this thought when I was 

361
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,250
teaching this material probably 15 years
ago,

362
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,130
I thought there was a little voice in my
head that said,

363
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:50,581
well,
you know,

364
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,080
you should lighten up a bit.
And I thought,

365
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,460
what do you mean?
I'm talking about genocides,

366
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,900
like,
yeah,

367
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,733
I'm going to lighten up.
And then I thought if I was thinking 

368
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
about young's notion of the,
of the gesture and the joker as a 

369
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:06,370
precursor to the savior there,
there's this element of,

370
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,483
of subversion and humor that goes along 
with attempting to crack a difficult 

371
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,980
problem.
And I,

372
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,600
I thought about that for about five 
years and I thought,

373
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,291
no,
it's right.

374
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,190
If you,
if,

375
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,323
if there isn't

376
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,620
okay,

377
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,453
if there isn't something that's akin to 
the sort of thing that a comedian does 

378
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,740
when you're talking about something,
then you're doing it too seriously.

379
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,890
It means you haven't mastered it.
You can't do it with a light touch.

380
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,650
So,
and I think you can see that in him.

381
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,243
Well there's,
there's one on the left there that's 

382
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:43,900
Hitler for president.
So what do you,

383
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,100
what do you see in that

384
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,030
clear direction?

385
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,730
Yeah.
What else?

386
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,680
How would,
how,

387
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,680
how is there an indication of clear 
direction is sort of posture.

388
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,593
Okay.

389
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,490
Yeah,
yeah,

390
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,440
absolutely.
It's,

391
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,350
it's,
well,

392
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:08,831
it's,
it's,

393
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,160
it's very intense,
um,

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,033
perspective.
So there's a force moving upward and 

395
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,140
he's at the top of the forest of the 
lines go weirdly,

396
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:17,974
they go to the left,
which is quite interesting because 

397
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:20,194
generally the way you would read a 
poster like that is that harsh movement 

398
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:25,390
to the left is regressive,
right?

399
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,130
It's backwards.
But you know,

400
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,343
you can understand why that might be.
And he's clearly the thing that sits on 

401
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,200
top of the pillars.
Remember I showed you a picture of,

402
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:35,831
oh,
Cyrus,

403
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,800
you may not remember this.
That was all cyrus's hand on a pillar.

404
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,833
It's the same idea.
You know that his body is the body of 

405
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,560
the state and the state has this 
powerful movement forward.

406
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,603
Then there's,
this is an infamous picture this in the 

407
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,980
middle.
So what do you think about that?

408
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,250
Oh yeah,
he's a knight.

409
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,110
He's a white knight,
in fact.

410
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,513
Yeah.
So he's assimilated to the idea of 

411
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,270
medieval nobility,
you know,

412
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:05,300
and in its purest form,
he's a knight of the people,

413
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,950
you know?
And so,

414
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,210
okay,

415
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,043
there's a Wagnerian element to that.
And he was a great admirer of Wagner 

416
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,253
Wagnerian music right away.
And Hitler wanted to put music halls in 

417
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,390
every classical music halls in every 
city in Europe.

418
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,130
It was starting to obsession of his,
he was obsessed with Wagnerian opera.

419
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:26,840
And he claimed that he had quasi 
religious experiences listening to it,

420
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,320
you know?
So He's a very strange character because

421
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,813
Hitler was extremely,
appears to have been extremely high and 

422
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:35,914
openness,
which is not something you would expect 

423
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:39,580
for someone who was a tyrant,
you know,

424
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,423
because conservative people are 
basically very low in openness and very 

425
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:44,774
high in orderliness.
But he appeared to be someone who is 

426
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:49,370
very high in orderliness and very high 
in openness.

427
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,770
And I think that's one of the things 
that made him charismatic,

428
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,260
you know?
So there's a deeply conservative element

429
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,640
and an element that was obsessed with 
will and antithetical to chaos.

430
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:03,310
But he was able to bring this tremendous
artistic force into his pope,

431
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,140
politicking and it,
it was captivating to people,

432
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,453
hmm.

433
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,370
To what was conference Satori.
Yeah.

434
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:18,890
Well I think that's a perfectly 
reasonable way of thinking about it.

435
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,710
But I also think he was open by 
temperament.

436
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,903
And so one of the things that happens to
open people is that if they listened to 

437
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,940
music that really captures them,
you know,

438
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,860
the hair stands up on the back of their 
neck.

439
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,310
There they are experienced experiences 
sort of ad hand,

440
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,013
you know?
And I also think it's very easy for 

441
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:39,620
people to assume that if they're having 
that experience,

442
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:42,770
that they're being inhabited by 
something that's akin to divinity.

443
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,720
You know,
and you know,

444
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,963
you don't,
you don't want to make light of that 

445
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,850
kind of experience because music is 
incredibly gripping.

446
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,310
Almost everyone likes music.
You know,

447
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,830
some people like conventional music,
so you know,

448
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,610
they can tolerate a little bit of 
exposure to the divine force of music.

449
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,653
Not much.
That's usually conservatives because 

450
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,430
they listened to very conventional pop 
music.

451
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,930
And then there's this wide variation,
but almost across almost all people,

452
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:13,700
music produces this influx of,
of Dionysian force,

453
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,220
you know,
really hyper conservative.

454
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,820
So band music and dancing,
right.

455
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,130
So because it's subversive.
So,

456
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,560
and then you have the one on the,
on the right.

457
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,270
So tell me about that one.

458
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,640
Especially the middle one that this 
barely when facing the Friday.

459
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,780
So you can imagine you staring at the of
it and the next one is like light behind

460
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:50,190
him acting out like this.
You're going to save everything.

461
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,500
Yeah,
absolutely.

462
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:54,600
He's at the forefront of the heroic.
Um,

463
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,770
what would you call that?
It's enrollment formation.

464
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,360
Yes,
exactly.

465
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,380
He's at the very forefront of that,
you know?

466
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,990
And so yes.

467
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,163
Oh,
did say

468
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,861
no,
go ahead.

469
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:06,694
Go ahead.

470
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,080
Oh my

471
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,330
absolutely.
You know,

472
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:12,470
so,
but what's happening,

473
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,304
if you look at that image,
it's like that's Christ with the Holy 

474
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,173
Ghost.
The Holy Ghost is represented by a dog 

475
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,963
and that's often associated and 
Christian symbolism with the Messenger 

476
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:26,870
of God manifesting itself.
In some sense.

477
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,890
One of the deeper,
deepest Christian ideas is the idea that

478
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:35,891
when Christ died and left,
there was something left behind that was

479
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:36,764
still divine,
that could communicate with human 

480
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,044
beings.
And that was partly outside at partly 

481
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:41,594
inside.
Now the thing about Hitler is that it's 

482
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,450
not a dove that's an eagle.
An Eagle is a carrion eater,

483
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,950
right?
It's a bird of prey.

484
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,413
And so,
and it's very interesting image because 

485
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,323
you know,
you have to come to terms with the fact 

486
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:59,930
that Hitler was a master of speech and 
that made him a master of logos,

487
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,270
right?
Because that speech and communication,

488
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,730
but the question is,
you know,

489
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,720
that that seemed to be,
I think it's difficult to deny that that

490
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,510
was perverted in the favor of something 
else.

491
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,583
And so the spirit that is coming out of 
the sun and flying b behind Hitler is a 

492
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:20,890
devouring carry on eating bird of prey.
No.

493
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,591
And that's,
and,

494
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,940
and you know,
people think eagles,

495
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,110
they're powerful.
It is the,

496
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,150
you know,
the national bird of the United States,

497
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,133
Benjamin Franklin recommended that it 
would be the Turkey and everyone laughs 

498
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,950
about that.
But you know,

499
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,230
it's worth thinking about.

500
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,570
Can't you also kind of say the Burger 
right?

501
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,443
Would be like a felt in the chorus in a 
way that he has this great vision and 

502
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:42,110
sight?

503
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,620
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

504
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,010
I mean

505
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,720
there's,
there's no shortage of it.

506
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:50,040
I've things about eagles that inspire 
admiration in people,

507
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,200
but it's not a dove.
Yeah.

508
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,990
So the message and it's black,
not white,

509
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,700
you know,
so the message is quite,

510
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,170
you know,
when the flag itself,

511
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,004
those are the three primary colors.
Like if you look around cultures 

512
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:06,250
worldwide and you look at names for 
colors,

513
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,670
every culture has a name for black,
white and red.

514
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,743
And then after that the color is 
fragments so that some are more 

515
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:15,700
frequently named than others.
You know,

516
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,160
because you can start well yeah,
like his orange rand.

517
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,600
Well,
you know,

518
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,260
yes and no.
It depends on how differentiated your,

519
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,880
your,
your languages.

520
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:26,470
But black,
white and red,

521
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,920
you know,
that's fruit day and night.

522
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:32,470
That's one way of looking at her.
It's blood day and night.

523
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,843
So,
or it's rage day and night or war day 

524
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:38,290
and night.
And so it's a powerful symbol.

525
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,230
It's also a sun symbol.
It's a sanskrit symbol,

526
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,840
but it's rotating backwards instead of 
forwards.

527
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,213
So,

528
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,870
okay.

529
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,703
You know,
when the Nazis were very aware in many 

530
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,450
ways of the meanings of the images that 
they were using.

531
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,823
But I'm showing you this because I want 
to show you how the archetypes were 

532
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,551
captured by the propagandist 
propagandists or hold the archetypes are

533
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:04,444
actually manifesting themselves in some 
sense to produce the kind of powerful 

534
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,004
grip that Hitler had over his audience.
And it was certainly the archetypes of 

535
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,690
order,
the archetypes of heroism.

536
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,160
All of those are being put at the 
service of a political ideology.

537
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,520
Riley's father images or individual 
images.

538
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,890
Well,
they're both,

539
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,740
it depends on the image,
you know.

540
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:31,741
So in some images he's more like the 
father of the people and other images.

541
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:35,110
He's more like the heroic Mara Duck at 
the,

542
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,840
at the forefront of the march into 
battle with,

543
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,860
with the illuminated God's behind them.
So,

544
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,490
and there's no reason for him not to 
take on both symbolic aspects.

545
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,620
Like we know for example,
that as far as the,

546
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,083
as the Egyptians were concerned,
the ideal pharaoh was Hafele Cyrus and 

547
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:53,800
half horace.
Right?

548
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,813
So embodied stability and also the 
vision and the capacity to update that 

549
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:01,030
stability.
So,

550
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,100
so this is actually counter propaganda 
or maybe it's not,

551
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:06,934
maybe it's an attempt to represent the 
part of Hitler that isn't being 

552
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:14,011
represented by the German propaganda.
So on the left you have,

553
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,300
well those are Nazi snakes.
They've got swastikas all over them.

554
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,700
And so that's an interesting image as 
far as I'm concerned because you see how

555
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:28,960
logical it is to use the image of the 
knotted up snakes.

556
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,790
And there's a frog in there too,
by the way.

557
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,650
Snakes and frogs all nodded together,
makes a,

558
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,670
a representation of the enemy,
the evil enemy.

559
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,550
Like you get that at a glance,
right?

560
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,570
You don't need that bloody thing.

561
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,430
Interpreted.
Makes perfect sense.

562
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,100
You know when you see the same things 
interesting.

563
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:45,934
And Leonardo,
I think I showed you some of the in 

564
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:52,270
representations of Mary when she's 
holding the infant out of the way of the

565
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,400
snake or the lizard that she's stepping 
on.

566
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,940
It's a very similar idea.
And then you have Hitler's head there as

567
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,010
a spreading hydra.
You know,

568
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:01,480
he's sort of like a finger of death.
He's,

569
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,890
he's sort of like Ursula in the Little 
Mermaid,

570
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,510
you know?
Except he's,

571
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
he's,
well,

572
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,023
it's not only a masculine image that 
because the spreading tentacles that 

573
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:13,924
snake like again,
and so there's an element of the Medusa 

574
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,790
there that's a very archaic symbol,
you know?

575
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,940
And then you have another image on the 
right there,

576
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:22,774
which is,
you know,

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,040
a graphical representation of Hitler and
his head is tangled up with the snake.

578
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,053
So

579
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,810
yeah,

580
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,830
you can see,

581
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,410
okay,

582
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,400
the reason those images have power is 
because there

583
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,980
they're taking the power that's implicit
in the archetype and harnessing it for a

584
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:49,560
message that's been sent in a sense 
actually what propaganda is like,

585
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,394
if you know the nature of the message 
that you're using the archetype to 

586
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,790
promote,
then it's propaganda.

587
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,953
If you're trying to figure something 
else out and the symbolic 

588
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,960
representations come to mind as part of 
the creative process,

589
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,003
then that's not propaganda.
But then it also usually means that you 

590
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:10,280
end up producing a piece of art that you
actually don't understand.

591
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,713
You know,
and there's still lots of renaissance 

592
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:13,544
artists like that you like,
it contains information that we haven't 

593
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,170
even come close to processing yet.
You know,

594
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,250
and I think most artistic 
representations or you know,

595
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,390
partly propaganda and properly our pro,
partly art,

596
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,950
it depends on the representation.

597
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,670
So then on the left you have,
again that's,

598
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,563
that's anti Nazi,
that's an anti Nazi poster and you have 

599
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:38,524
the idea of the dark figure lurking in 
the background who sort of everywhere 

600
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,673
gazing at you.
So that's like George Orwell's big 

601
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:47,351
brother,
right?

602
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:48,184
So that's definitely harnessing the idea
of the terrible aspect of the great 

603
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,260
father.
And I really liked this one on the,

604
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,220
on the right because that's basically,
well that's the virgin and child,

605
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:57,940
you know,
it's not a,

606
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,773
it's not precisely a Christian image.
It doesn't matter because that's not 

607
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:01,804
precisely a Christian representation,
but she's beautiful and young and she's 

608
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:07,390
holding something that's very vulnerable
in her arms.

609
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,100
And then you see these hands at the top 
there,

610
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,710
um,
Nazi.

611
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,500
And at the bottom there,
Japanese,

612
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,483
because the symbols are on them.
And so one's coming from one end and 

613
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:20,380
one's coming from the other.
And so what are the hands look like?

614
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,393
Hmm.

615
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,051
Well,
yeah,

616
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:24,980
but why,
why,

617
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,440
what,
how,

618
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,960
what makes them evil?

619
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,043
Shadows.

620
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,520
Yeah.
They have claws.

621
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,050
So they're predatory,
right?

622
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,273
And their wisdom.
And so they're sort of like death and 

623
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,000
they're black.
You know,

624
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:38,410
the thing is,
it's so obvious,

625
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:39,020
right?
You know,

626
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,850
those are evil hands.
The question is,

627
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,580
why do you know that they're evil hands?
You know,

628
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:47,270
what is it about the image that 
announces itself in that way?

629
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,040
It's also partly because of their 
juxtaposition with the image of purity.

630
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:52,874
So that's really the absolute corrupt,
great farther reaching out for the 

631
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:02,621
absolute perfect feminine and hero,
the baby hero and threatening that.

632
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,080
So there's some anti Jewish propaganda 
on the right there.

633
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:18,590
So first of all,
the Jewish guy is represented as a money

634
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,910
changer and he's associated with the,
the Soviet Union because they,

635
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,843
they,
the onsies drew a tight relationship 

636
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:25,904
between Jews and communism.
And so that was amalgamated into the 

637
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,380
same kind of threat.
And then,

638
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,150
and certainly the case that Germany was 
threatened by communism.

639
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:36,920
I mean there's absolutely no doubt about
that,

640
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,250
but say sort of lump their enemies into 
one category.

641
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,090
And so what do you think about the 
representation on the right?

642
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,120
What does it say?
I don't believe so.

643
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,020
A whole,
did you say?

644
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,600
Yeah.
No I don't.

645
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,260
I don't think so.
So his eyes are closed.

646
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,570
That's kind of interesting.
Um,

647
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,810
his hands,
his outstretched with money and he seems

648
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:09,644
to be,
I would say is hand head is oriented 

649
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,280
towards the money.
Yes.

650
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,510
Is that,
is that right?

651
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,590
So I don't know what he's leaning on 
exactly.

652
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:19,730
I don't know what that is,

653
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,010
but it's obviously not a flattery 
representation.

654
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:28,040
And then you have the middle 
representation.

655
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,874
Yes.

656
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,473
Right.

657
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,190
Yeah.
That's a good one.

658
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,641
Yeah.
Yeah.

659
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:46,890
There is a goal,
an element to that.

660
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,540
Do you want to explain what that means?

661
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,830
Um,

662
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,800
yeah.
It's like a Zombie.

663
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,763
Yes.
Carry out the will of the last 

664
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,763
murderous.

665
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,180
Right.
So,

666
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,013
yeah.
So,

667
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,883
so there's that,
there's a sort of undead element to the 

668
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,230
representation.
Blind focused only on money.

669
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,290
Um,
you know,

670
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,140
and then also aligned with this terrible
destructive force of communism.

671
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,190
So another comment.
Yes.

672
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,561
Right,
right.

673
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:52,490
Yeah.
Good point.

674
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,630
Good point.
Yes.

675
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,643
So then there's the middle one,
then you see the juxtaposition of the 

676
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:02,290
Jewish Star of David with the communist 
hammer and sickle,

677
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,790
and you see the whole world on fire and 
death emerging from that.

678
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,020
Right?
So there's a,

679
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,530
there's an idea of the ultimate call 
apocalypse behind that.

680
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:12,364
There's an idea of hell behind that.
There's an idea of like the living dead 

681
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,740
and,
and then,

682
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,843
you know,
and this is something that's sitting on 

683
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:22,840
top of the world.
It's very say titanic image,

684
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,150
I think it says,

685
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,820
okay,

686
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,380
I don't know.
It's Bolshevik.

687
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,570
Part of that is,
and I don't know if there's an amalgam,

688
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,404
there is,
if is miss is a reference to Jewishness 

689
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:40,560
or not.
I think it says Bolshevism unmasked.

690
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:41,610
It's something like that.

691
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,743
So,

692
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,960
you know,
and the idea that,

693
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,530
that the Nazis were anticommunist was 
very powerful idea for people.

694
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:54,310
It made the morality of the situation 
very murky in many ways.

695
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,144
Because for example,
when the Nazis went into Russia through 

696
00:36:57,821 --> 00:36:58,654
the Ukraine,
the Ukrainian started to fight with the 

697
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:02,980
Nazis,
like alongside of them to get rid of the

698
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:05,290
communists because as far as they were 
concerned,

699
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,260
the communists were worse than the 
Nazis.

700
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,860
So you know,
it was a race to the bottom,

701
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,890
that's for sure.
And then it's so interesting because you

702
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:15,724
see the fire,
the destructive fire in the middle and 

703
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:19,810
then on the left,
well those are crematoriums,

704
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:20,644
I believe they're from Auschwitz and 
that those are the remnants of the 

705
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,370
destroyed bodies in the ovens.
So you know,

706
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:30,280
all of that death and destruction was 
being projected.

707
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,114
In some sense,
all the evil was being projected on to 

708
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,940
the communists and the Jews.
And you know,

709
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,793
that allowed the exactly the same thing 
to manifest itself in actuality in 

710
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:47,881
Germany.
Well that's the laying out of the body.

711
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:55,060
So on the left and then that's Hitler 
closer to the end of the war.

712
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:58,330
And you know,
he's looking pretty haggard and

713
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,430
his mouth is down and his countenance 
has fallen,

714
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:06,640
which is a phrase that we'll encounter 
next week.

715
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,093
Okay?

716
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,090
So you know,
you see this image of Hitler on the left

717
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:14,924
and he sort of friend to children with 
the mother looking on happily in the 

718
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:18,884
back and everybody's smiling and happy.
And then in the middle you see someone 

719
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,620
who's been burned.
One of the things that happened when the

720
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:28,400
Nazis marched the Jews out of the camps 
when the allies were coming is now,

721
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:31,310
and then they'd put a bunch of people in
the barn and light it on fire.

722
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,740
And I believe that that's an image from 
that.

723
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,090
And then that's prisoner at the bottom 
from one of the,

724
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,360
who didn't die from one of the Holocaust
counts.

725
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,170
So I would say,
you know,

726
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:46,180
the problem with the image on the last

727
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,480
okay

728
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,450
is that it doesn't factor in the image 
in the middle.

729
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,730
And that's the thing about propaganda,
you know,

730
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,380
it's like,
it's all good.

731
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:56,214
It's like,
yeah,

732
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,053
no.
And if it's presenting itself as all 

733
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,080
good,
then you got to ask yourself,

734
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,610
well,
where's the snake?

735
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,133
Cause there's always a snake.
And I would say the more [inaudible] 

736
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,530
represents itself as pure good,
the bigger the snake.

737
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,963
So you know,
Dostoyevsky knew that when he started 

738
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,940
writing anti utopian anti Utopian ideas,
especially in notes from underground,

739
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:21,150
he'd already figured out that if someone
was promising you haven't,

740
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:25,080
that the probability that there was a 
hell lurking in there somewhere was,

741
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,273
well it was 100% so,
and part of the reason that I've been 

742
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:33,130
working on the ideas in this book and 
presenting them to people for so long is

743
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:33,964
I'm trying to inoculate people against 
the temptations of Utopian thinking and 

744
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:38,424
propaganda.
Because you should always be asking 

745
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:42,270
yourself,
where's the other half?

746
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,310
If nature is all beautiful.
Well,

747
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:46,410
what about the destructive part?
You don't want,

748
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:48,720
if you're offering a utopia,
well,

749
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,613
aren't you also a devil in a tyrant?
Like what are you going to do with that 

750
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:53,604
part?
You have what what you're gonna do is 

751
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:55,321
you're going to say,
well,

752
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:58,590
I'm not the devil on the tire.
And it's those people over there.

753
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,663
It's like,
which only proves that you are in fact 

754
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:01,644
both the devil and the tyrant,
but it's much easier for people to put 

755
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:06,600
that out somewhere else,
you know,

756
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,070
because do you really want to deal with 
it?

757
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:08,904
You know,
you said at the beginning of the class 

758
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:10,704
you wrote out what horrible things might
happen to you if you didn't behave 

759
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:13,944
properly.
And that's unsettling because you have 

760
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:20,010
to recognize in yourself the capacity to
bring something like that about.

761
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,963
It's even worse than that because people
can bring that sort of thing about and 

762
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,590
really enjoy it while it's happening.
You know,

763
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:29,130
in a really corrupt and destructive way.
It's a revenge.

764
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,580
They're looking for revenge and if they 
have to take it on themselves,

765
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,130
that's no problem.
It just makes the revenge even sweeter.

766
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,673
Okay.

767
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,670
So there's juxtapositions again,
you know,

768
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,504
so I've got the crowd that surrounding 
Hitler all happy at the dinner table 

769
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:47,104
there on the left and then you know,
that's cartloads of bodies that were 

770
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,660
taken away from the concentration 
council and the allies came in.

771
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,750
So there's the tyrannical father and 
the,

772
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,690
and the positive for other,
you know,

773
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,993
not I believe is from Nuremberg,
although I'm not absolutely certain 

774
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:14,294
about.
So Nuremberg was the place where the 

775
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:17,600
massive Nazi spectacles were held.
You know,

776
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,630
when you can see the Greek and Roman 
symbolism there,

777
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,743
like the classical,
the idea that it was a reestablishment 

778
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:28,931
of our enlightened classical society,
brilliant use of light against dark,

779
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,013
which something was something that the 
Nazi as the beats were good at the use 

780
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:38,010
of fire and light and black,
white and red contrast.

781
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:39,720
Very,
very powerful imagery.

782
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,083
I would say literature does great.
Literature does because it presents 

783
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:21,880
people as the battleground between chaos
and order in good and evil,

784
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,860
every person.
So,

785
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:26,470
you know,
someone might be tilted towards the good

786
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,880
and in a great piece of literature,
but they're not,

787
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,330
they're not comic book Superhero,
you know,

788
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,493
and I mean,
even the comic books when they were DC 

789
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:39,610
comic books,
that was pretty damn clear.

790
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,440
Superman,
he was all good.

791
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,333
The evils evil villains,
they were all villainous when the 

792
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:47,090
marvel,
um,

793
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,460
what would you call mythologist sort of 
emerged in the 1960s.

794
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:54,460
All the characters became more nuanced 
and you know,

795
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:58,060
they're more palatable to I would say a 
a martyred mind.

796
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:01,060
But also of course,
older people are paying attention to the

797
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:01,894
comic book characters now.
They're not for before they were for 

798
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,560
like 10 year olds,
you know,

799
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:06,394
so they like,
they couldn't handle the complexity of 

800
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:10,630
something that was more than one thing 
at the same time.

801
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,963
But,
but like if you look at great 

802
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,824
literature,
the heroes are often 51% good and 49% 

803
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,940
evil,
you know,

804
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:26,770
and there's a tremendous battle going on
inside them and outside of them.

805
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,460
And so that makes it a lot more nuanced 
and complex,

806
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:33,580
but it's also in some ways much more 
frustrating to read.

807
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,223
So yeah,
so I would say the greater the 

808
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:38,344
literature and the more it approximates 
aren't the more balanced the portrayal 

809
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:45,850
of the entire scenario.
So you have the chaos in the background,

810
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,810
you have the positive and negative 
feminine and various manners.

811
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:52,240
You have the tyrant.
And the secure father,

812
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:56,230
you have the adversary and the hero.
They had the whole picture is painted.

813
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,080
You see the same thing,
I think in any great art.

814
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,690
So that's what makes it great.

815
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,290
Yes,
exactly it,

816
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,124
it did.
It tilts into either oversimplification 

817
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:13,730
or propaganda.
So,

818
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,500
and it's dangerous,
especially,

819
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,650
especially when it harnesses the 
archetypal forces.

820
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:19,484
So one of the things that's happened 
since Nietzsche announced the death of 

821
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:27,341
God is that political entities have 
appropriated the archetypes.

822
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,671
We think,
well,

823
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,790
the gods are still in those archetypes.
There's no getting rid of them.

824
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,760
So the question is,
who's going to be using them?

825
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,650
And for what?
You know,

826
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:38,431
cause we think,
well,

827
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:40,080
we've transcended all that.
It's like,

828
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:40,914
yeah,
right.

829
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,080
You know,
you go see the avengers,

830
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,290
you know,
so you haven't transcended at all.

831
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,213
In fact,
you're more bone headed about it then 

832
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:49,134
people were 200 years ago because now 
it's comic book superheroes instead of 

833
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,600
transcendent daddies.
I don't,

834
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:57,930
I don't see that as a consumption,
a conceptual improvement.

835
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,870
I see it as a regression.
So,

836
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,020
and that's a general who shot himself to
death.

837
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,550
A Nazi general,
you know,

838
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:10,551
win the victory of the allies was 
certain and Hitler by that time.

839
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,020
Okay.

840
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,020
Basically the way Hitler rationalized 
his defeat was the Germans let me down,

841
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,410
Berlin should burn.
And if the Russians come in and rape and

842
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:25,440
pillage the people who had happens to 
deserve it.

843
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,220
So that was his final judgment on the 
German people.

844
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:31,140
It wasn't that there was something wrong
with him,

845
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,450
is that it was that they just failed 
him.

846
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,300
And so they weren't up to the glorious 
task that he had set them.

847
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,510
And so they deserved all the rack and 
ruin that was being visited on them.

848
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,193
So,
and when I look at that and I see what 

849
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:43,494
happened,
Hitler shot himself in a bunker far 

850
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:47,510
below ba Berlin when Europe was on fire.
Right.

851
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,500
Thing.
What makes you think that wasn't what he

852
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:53,900
was after from the beginning?
No one thinks that they think of,

853
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:55,990
well he know he wanted to build an 
empire,

854
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:58,270
dominate the world and all those things.
It's like,

855
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,890
why would you think that?

856
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,800
Yeah,

857
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,240
there's an old psychoanalytic idea.
If you don't understand the motivation,

858
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,290
look at the consequences.
And in further motivation,

859
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,773
it's extraordinarily intelligent idea.
So you can't figure out what someone's 

860
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,270
up to.
Okay.

861
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,570
What happens when they do whatever 
they're doing?

862
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,383
Well,
if it's utter catastrophe and pain and 

863
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:22,920
ruined,
you might think,

864
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:23,754
oh,
well there was some part of them that 

865
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,130
was aiming at that.
Now,

866
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,063
you know,
you have to factor out the effects of 

867
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:28,674
random chance,
but there was nothing random about what 

868
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:34,140
Hitler did to Europe.
Quite the contrary.

869
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,970
You know,
when you might ask yourself,

870
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:39,480
why did he open up a two front war,
you know,

871
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,493
he wasn't historically ignorant.
You kind of knew by that point that 

872
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,500
attacking Russia was probably not the 
best thing to do if you actually want it

873
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:47,400
to win the war.
Now,

874
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:48,234
you know,
you could say that he was arrogant and 

875
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,210
overvalued the,
the power of the,

876
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,103
of the Nazi war machine,
and it was two contemptuous of the 

877
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:59,700
Russians and part of them,
no doubt.

878
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,350
Yeah.

879
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,050
Tell it that way.
But by the same token,

880
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:04,884
you can't suppress the suspicion that 
the darkest parts of him thought that's 

881
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:13,680
the fastest way to rack and ruin the,
certainly produced it.

882
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,163
Sure.

883
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,900
Yeah.

884
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,900
Why assume that the person is aiming for
what they say they're aiming for,

885
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:23,344
especially if they use means that are as
undeniably evil is anything you could 

886
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:32,821
possibly come across top left.
That's Stellan.

887
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:34,194
And so there is an old guy kissing a 
statue of Stella and a gold statue of 

888
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:38,970
Stella,
and that's after the wall fell.

889
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,490
You know,
installing was an otter monster,

890
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,500
you know,
he made Hitler into,

891
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,490
he made Hitler

892
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,380
in many ways,
Hitler was a piker compared to style it.

893
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,483
And one of the very final things about 
Hitler that's extraordinarily funny in 

894
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:57,360
the worst possible manner is that one of
the only people he ever trusted,

895
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,283
sorry Stellan one of the people,
only people that still in ever trusted 

896
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:03,990
was Hitler.
So we prepared,

897
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,020
he failed to prepare the Russian army,
the Soviet army for a potential invasion

898
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,820
by the Germans because Hitler said he 
wouldn't invade.

899
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,130
And so when the Germans finally showed 
up,

900
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:17,640
they just blew the Russians back.
They were completely unprepared,

901
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,863
you know?
And if the Russians couldn't have had 

902
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:21,750
the Germans freeze to death because of 
the winter,

903
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,160
there's little doubt that the Germans 
would have overrun the Soviet Union.

904
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,770
I mean the Russians were tough and they 
fought like mad,

905
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,070
but they were completely and utterly 
unprepared.

906
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:38,170
So,
okay.

907
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,970
Okay.
So what we've been doing now,

908
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,010
like we're,
I want,

909
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,853
I'm kind of working towards the idea,
we're moving up the food chain in some 

910
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:48,904
sense.
So we talked about chaos and we talked 

911
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:51,034
about the great mother and now we've 
talked about the great father and we're 

912
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:56,380
sort of tilting up towards the final 
level of analysis,

913
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,243
which is the relationship between the 
individual and the adversary and then 

914
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:04,030
the relationship between both of those 
and the other levels.

915
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:04,971
You know,
and we,

916
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:05,804
we touched on that a little bit today 
because we could see how Hitler was 

917
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,590
presented both as great father but also 
as you know,

918
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,483
heroic leader into the future.
You see the same thing with style in 

919
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,200
there where he's shown us,
you know,

920
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,530
leader of the ship of state and he's far
as I'm concerned.

921
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:22,840
He's nothing different than captain hook
who's a tyrant.

922
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:25,930
Because he's afraid that he's afraid of 
his own mortality.

923
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:26,903
He is afraid of the fact that the 
crocodiles already got a piece of him 

924
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,230
and turns them into a tire and he's 
terrified of chaos.

925
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,020
Terrified of the positive feminine for 
that matter.

926
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,190
And there,
you know,

927
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,250
you see,
well there's stolen,

928
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,323
you know,
the,

929
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:45,070
the farther of all Soviet people,
loving music,

930
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,190
friend to women and children,
you know,

931
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,024
and there's a statue of style and that 
was toppled after the Berlin wall fell 

932
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:52,564
and it's covered with red paint.
While you can imagine what that 

933
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,054
indicates,

934
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,020
I really liked the one on the left,
that style.

935
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,933
I mean,
I look at that and I think you could 

936
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:04,464
hardly,
if you were attempting to build a 

937
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:10,620
representation of the devil himself in 
developed in flames,

938
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,930
you could hardly do a better job than 
that picture.

939
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,333
You know,
it's,

940
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,223
it's,

941
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,183
yeah.

942
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,750
And then on the,
on the left,

943
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,584
on the right there you have lennon in 
the background and styling in the 

944
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:24,950
foreground on the flag,
you know,

945
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:25,784
so those are the,
the two day at ease of the Russian 

946
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:32,120
state.
There are what replaced God once,

947
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,983
you know,
once Nietzsche and announce God was 

948
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:34,851
dead.
It was like,

949
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:35,684
okay,
well what's going to come up and fill 

950
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:37,340
that void?
It's like,

951
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,383
Oh,
good.

952
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,870
It's Hitler and Lenin and Stalin.
That's a real improvement.

953
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,173
Okay.

954
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,450
That smile on the left there and you 
know,

955
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,293
the estimates are that he was involved 
in the death of about a hundred million 

956
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:54,910
people,
so which you never hear anything about.

957
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:59,911
He was also a hero of the radical left 
in the 1960s anyways,

958
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,160
we'll stop for now.
