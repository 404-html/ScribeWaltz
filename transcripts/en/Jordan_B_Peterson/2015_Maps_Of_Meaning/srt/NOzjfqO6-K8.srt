1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,003
I become aware of over the last five 
years or so that there's a significant 

2
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:14,980
overlap between the concepts that I'm 
telling you about and Heidi groups work.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,830
I didn't know that,
you know,

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,880
ideas come from lots of different 
places.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,233
It's hard to track them down,
but when heidegger was trying to what 

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,703
what heidegger's philosophical program 
essentially consisted of was the 

7
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,224
rediscovery of being now he believed 
that prior to the ancient Greeks for 

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
quite rational and modern in their 
approach to the world that people lived 

9
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,864
in a relationship with being that was 
much less mediated by interpretive 

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,874
structures I suppose is one way of 
thinking about it and he thought of 

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,600
being as something that was in framed 
and the framing,

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,853
which is also a term that I use.
The framing restricts the manner in 

13
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,514
which being is able to manifest itself.
So it's like a reduction of being 

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,440
something specific.

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,010
Now it's pretty obvious and Heidi girl 
obviously knew this,

16
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,844
that in order to interact with something
you have to simultaneously not interact 

17
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,284
with everything.
So you have to reduce the phenomenon to 

18
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,010
pinpoint before you can.
You can actually interact with it in any

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,783
immediately useful manner,
but when I'm hiding her points was that 

20
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,704
that also restricts our ability to be in
direct contact with speeding and he 

21
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,980
thought of that as like the ground of 
meaning.

22
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,270
Now I think there's different sorts of 
meeting and perhaps if you're getting to

23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,570
is the meaning of the thing that reveals
itself to you.

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,530
And so that would be the meaning of an 
anomaly in some sense.

25
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,610
And then there's the meaning of the 
framework that you used to interpret the

26
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,444
situation.
And then there's the meaning that you 

27
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,994
experienced when you transform the 
framework that you use to look at 

28
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,330
things.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,910
So those are all forms of meeting and 
they're all interrelated.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,793
But,
um,

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,840
it has striking to me,
Heidi,

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,753
that Heidegger,
heidegger hiding Heideggerian approach 

33
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,540
to this because in some sense he was 
also reacted to niches,

34
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,374
ideas about the debt gone.
So it was an attempt to help people 

35
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,134
reorient themselves in the world in,
in the novel historical situation where 

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,593
we had to become.
You cashed in some ways from our 

37
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,084
traditional religious beliefs,
which were in some sense a form of 

38
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,980
framing.
You know,

39
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,090
one of the things young said about 
religions,

40
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,943
he said the purpose of her religion was 
to stop you from having religious 

41
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,084
experiences.
It's quite an interesting way of 

42
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,634
thinking about it because what was 
claiming was that the purpose of a 

43
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:04,674
religious system wants to filter the 
overwhelming power of being down to a 

44
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,280
point where you could tolerate 
conceptualizing it,

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,203
but you know the price you paid for.
That was a certain kind of arbitrary 

46
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,704
limitation clause.
You're always paying the price for 

47
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,764
arbitrators invitation,
but it would be nice if you could also 

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,693
transcended that from time to time and 
realize that there's meaning outside of 

49
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,150
the frameworks that you

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,140
generally in habit and that you can 
narrow those frameworks so much that you

51
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,810
don't get any of the vivifying form of 
meaning.

52
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,483
Yeah.

53
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,820
You would think of that when he was 
thinking about it symbolically.

54
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:48,600
You would think about that as the 
absence of the water of life sounds,

55
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,483
which is a very.
It's a very calm with multisig 

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,553
fairytales.
You know the king is old and desperate 

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,290
guy and the only thing that'll save the 
water of life is great.

58
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,173
Him,
his brother fairy tale just call the 

59
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:00,834
water of life.
It has exactly the perfect ms dot 

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,993
structure.
Now I think I showed you guys this last 

61
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,580
time.
Is that correct?

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,710
Is the director,
is that okay?

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,690
So that kind of summed up our discussion
about the dragon of chaos.

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,420
What I was trying to trying to 
communicate,

65
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,254
which I think is a very,
very difficult thing is that there are 

66
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:23,424
many different ways of conceptualizing 
the ground of being and you can do it 

67
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:30,000
from an objective perspective but.
And that's a very useful tool,

68
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,220
but I think that is a form of framing.

69
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,413
It's not so much a description of the 
nature of being per se and the being 

70
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:38,934
that we were speaking of.
I think his property conceptualized at 

71
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,720
least at least for some purposes in 
relationship to this diagram which says,

72
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,554
well,
being as a field of information from 

73
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:57,771
which you derive the common objects and 
entities that you interact with,

74
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,510
but also from which you derive your own 
structure,

75
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,673
your own experience and your own 
mechanisms of framing and so you can 

76
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,054
think of reality as that which allows 
for the derivation of those two things 

77
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,124
and I also made the case to you that I 
think you could make a strong case that 

78
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:18,504
that's actually how your brain works.
Your brain acts like that's the way the 

79
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:27,081
world is,
and then a secondary case that if that's

80
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:31,000
how your brain acts and your regard 
waiting,

81
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,240
then you're faced with a problem.

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,240
If you are attempting to make the claim 
that the objective world is the ultimate

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,170
reality because that isn't how your 
brain is set up.

84
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,763
At least in principle,
it evolved so that you wouldn't die 

85
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:49,490
because of your foolish ideas,
embodied or otherwise.

86
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,883
Anyways,
you can wrestle through that and your 

87
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,214
own lines.
It's very difficult thing to 

88
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,620
conceptualize.
Now,

89
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,890
one of the things that's characteristic 
of this particular diaper,

90
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,050
I missed that.
You've seen this in the book.

91
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:03,884
This is a bit of an elaboration of the 
idea of what happens to you when you 

92
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,373
encounter a.
normally what happens is fundamentally 

93
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:14,330
that your body prepares to do all 
manners of things.

94
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,370
Some of those are negative,
right?

95
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,204
Their experience as negative emotion is 
they're fundamentally intensive 

96
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,210
protection and protect them so they can 
evolve.

97
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,543
They can involve pain and frustration 
and disappointment and shame and guilt 

98
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,230
and all of those sorts of things as well
as fear.

99
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
But then the other side of that as well,
you know there's there's riches to be 

100
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,694
had when you encounter something novel 
and so the parts of your mind that are 

101
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,564
associated with creative exploration and
the reconfiguring of ideas should also 

102
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,750
be put on alert and that is what seems 
to happen.

103
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,613
So basically your response to a novel,
these to compare to do everything and 

104
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,460
that's.
That can be very exciting.

105
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,294
It can be extremely compelling.
So one of the things that I think is 

106
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,913
really worth thinking about,
and this is something we'll cover a lot 

107
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,030
of the class comes to a halt because 
this is one of the only optimistic ideas

108
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,113
I've never been able to derive from 
psychology that I actually think might 

109
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,580
be true.
And it's a really optimistic idea.

110
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,773
Like if you accept the idea that it's 
reasonable to construe the ground of 

111
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,770
reality in this manner.

112
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,760
And then you take seriously the two 
things,

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,623
the fact of your motivational.
You're embodied motivational and 

114
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,044
emotional response as one thing and then
the fact of the hierarchy of the 

115
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,950
normally so that some things are 
anomalous,

116
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,860
you know,
and it kind of trivial manner.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,490
And then some things are a novelist and 
an absolutely terrifying manner.

118
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,810
But so if you accept that you can draw 
further inference,

119
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:49,811
which is the well maybe sometimes things
are anomalous in an optimal manner now.

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,180
And then I would say,
well,

121
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,103
what we're defined that optimality.
Well let's assume that there is a 

122
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,194
meaningful ground of reality.
And then let's assume that there's a 

123
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:05,300
framing system that you have to use to 
deal with that.

124
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,134
And that's partly biological,
but it's also partly a consequence of 

125
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,083
inculturation,
and then let's assume that that framing 

126
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,904
system can get outdated,
so that's all associated with the 

127
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,430
stories that we've been talking about so
far.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,893
So then let's assume that the fact that 
it can be outdated is also an exit 

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,713
existential problems,
so it's a constant problem so that not 

130
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,320
only do you need to have a framing 
system,

131
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,154
but you need to have a mechanism that 
you could engage in to update the 

132
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:43,031
framing system optimally and then we can
take that one step further and say,

133
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,480
that's built right into you.
It's part of your nature is part of your

134
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,314
biology,
is part of the structure of your 

135
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:50,870
consciousness.
And then we could say,

136
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,280
well,
here's the hypothesis.

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,520
What if that's what's happening?
When you get engaged with something,

138
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,570
so imagine what your brain is trying to 
do.

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,433
Roughly speaking,
is to situate you in relationship to 

140
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,980
being so that you can both tolerate it.
For you can.

141
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,840
You can tolerate it,
appreciate it,

142
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,763
frame it and stay on profit and that 
your mind has to be able to signal to 

143
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,854
you when you're doing that,
and I think that's what happens when 

144
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,280
you're captured by something and you get
engagement.

145
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,160
It is what's happening is your mind is 
telling you,

146
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,140
your experiences telling you you're 
exactly situated in the right place.

147
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,650
You're stable enough so you're not going
to fall apart,

148
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,323
but you're fluid enough so that you're 
not going to fall prey to excess 

149
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,434
stability and then the experience of 
that as a spirit and experience of 

150
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:47,694
engaged meaning,
but there are phenomena that are 

151
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,860
associated with that too.
Like it's easy to pay attention.

152
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,323
It's just straightforward.
It's easy to pay attention to things 

153
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:56,994
that you're engaged by and I think that 
that's because your your mind roughly 

154
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,470
speaking,
your brain knows that,

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,333
that that information flow is maximized 
there so you're not going to be 

156
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,510
terrified and you're not going to be 
bored.

157
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,573
You're gonna be engaged.
You don't fall apart and you stay 

158
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,404
updated,
and so the way you experienced that is 

159
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,350
that the meeting is optimized under 
those conditions.

160
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,590
You're,
you're,

161
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,410
you're,
you're deep into the material,

162
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,510
so to speak,
and it's meaningful.

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
It's directly meaningful.
Yes.

164
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,463
So will this be a framework to explain 
why say novel music or stories or like 

165
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,270
an grossing video game even would induce
that?

166
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,610
Sure.
No one's another world,

167
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,444
so you're safe,
but also it's like an unfolding 

168
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,050
experience with both of those at the 
same time because it's,

169
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,103
you don't want to play a video game 
where there are no rules and you don't 

170
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,344
want to play a video game where the 
rules transformed so rapidly and 

171
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,343
radically that there's no can model.
You want to play a video game where you 

172
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,800
can suspend disbelief.
You know,

173
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,634
there's some play with the axiom,
so maybe there's some things about the 

174
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,860
model of reality that aren't exactly 
like real reality,

175
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,323
but once that framework is established,
once the rule governed framework is 

176
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,540
established,
there's play inside of it.

177
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,373
And that's very embarrassing.
And I think part of the reason it's 

178
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,774
engrossing is one,
you actually learn things from playing 

179
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,840
games because in some sense you're 
always playing a game,

180
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,183
right?
Because you're always inside a reality 

181
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,154
that's bounded by a certain set of 
assumptions and it's not the total 

182
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:29,724
reality.
It's like a game like representation of 

183
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,360
the total reality and you know,
hopefully it's a good enough gain.

184
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,200
Light Representation.
You know,

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,230
one of the things I was thinking about 
in relationship to video games was no,

186
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,613
I've read critiques of Video Games where
people complain about young people 

187
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:53,030
generally being engaged in video games 
to the expense,

188
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,410
having a real life.
And then I was making,

189
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,700
I don't know if you know about Edward,
I think his name is Ed Edward Castronova

190
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,620
now he's an economist who studied video 
games and he did this quite awhile ago.

191
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,510
I think it's gotta be more than 10 years
ago now,

192
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,344
but he made the claim at that point that
one of the big massive online player 

193
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:16,240
games,
I think it was world of warcraft,

194
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,470
but that might be wrong,
was like the 20th largest economy in the

195
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,304
world.

196
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,670
Really.
Not In any fate way,

197
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,700
partly because you could sell artifacts 
that you were producing on Ebay,

198
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:30,814
for example,
but also partly because people traded 

199
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,334
within it and like there was no reason 
to assume that the additional level of 

200
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,354
abstraction that that video game 
represented was necessarily any more 

201
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,840
abstract than what we were already doing
and economies.

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,210
So then you could ask yourself,
for example,

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,433
think about this.
Is it more real to lead a band of 

204
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,204
adventurers through a complex 
mythological reality in an online game 

205
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,740
or to work at Mcdonald's?
Now you'd say,

206
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,110
well,
what board Mcdonald's?

207
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,280
Because that's real,
but let's,

208
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,180
let's think about that for a minute.
So exactly why is it real mean,

209
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,014
first of all,
but is good and exist unless it was 

210
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,160
nested in a whole bunch of other things.
Right?

211
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,263
So it has to be nested in a functional 
capitalist economy and that has to be 

212
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,190
nested inside a functional political 
system.

213
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,024
And then there's all sorts of other 
preconditions in terms of material 

214
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,660
supply and so forth that have to be in 
place before you,

215
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,050
before you're able to work there and 
receive tokens for your labor.

216
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,600
Okay,
so

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,230
the same thing applies to the video 
games and you might say,

218
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:50,700
well how do you determine which of those
is real?

219
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:51,534
And I would say,
well maybe one of the ways of 

220
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:57,621
determining whether a game is real is to
what degree do you practice a wide range

221
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,603
of the sub sets of skills that would be 
transferable to other beings while 

222
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,584
you're playing that game.
And I think you could make a case that 

223
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,124
if you're playing a very complex video 
game that the activities that you're 

224
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,624
engaging in which involve leadership and
cooperation and communication and 

225
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:16,884
problem solving are actually a more 
comprehensive subset of the skills that 

226
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:25,590
you would have to develop to work in the
world as a complex place.

227
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,840
Then what you would pick up at 
Mcdonald's.

228
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,450
Now you know,
obviously you can argue that,

229
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:31,590
but it's not self evident.

230
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,293
So,

231
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,180
so back to framing.
Well you know,

232
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,500
one of the things,
the video game,

233
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,290
one of the,
one of the types of meeting,

234
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,520
one of the things that the video game 
designers really trying to do is put you

235
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,354
in the zone of proximal.
Now that's a term from the Godspeed who 

236
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:55,964
was a Russian development psychologist 
who was probably the most influential 

237
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,510
developmental psychologist apart from 
Psj.

238
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,860
Now what the Gonski noticed was that 
when parents talk to their children,

239
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,043
they talk to them constantly at a level 
that slightly exceeded what brand and 

240
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,923
you think that's so cool because on one 
hand they're communicating with their 

241
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,910
children because the children can 
understand what they're saying,

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,910
but on the other hand there are teaching
them to communicate,

243
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
to understand more things at the same 
time.

244
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,760
They're doing that in exactly the same 
time and he thought about is the zone of

245
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,594
proximal development because it was sort
of dragging the kids pass their current 

246
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,364
state of of comprehension and 
understanding it and framing into the 

247
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,290
next set.

248
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,123
And it's sort of analogous to the 
principle that I mentioned to you 

249
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,274
earlier about playing a game in a manner
that not only helps you win that game 

250
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,134
but helps you when all the other games 
that you're going to play after you 

251
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,414
played that game.
And that's playing the game at the zone 

252
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,320
of proximal development.
Because it involves generalization and I

253
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,970
would say that,
you know,

254
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,043
one of the real debates in psychology,
and it's an appalling debate as far as 

255
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm concerned,
is what's,

256
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,430
what is it that you can buck used to 
buttress yourself against the undeniable

257
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,530
catastrophes of existence,
you know,

258
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,940
because it's obvious to everyone that 
existence is tragic and it's fundamental

259
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:20,601
essence,
right?

260
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:25,100
Because people are limited and fraud and
mortal.

261
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,960
It's like that's a big problem.
Now,

262
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:27,794
hypothetically,
that was addressed quite well by 

263
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
traditional religious structures,
but then our ability to assume that they

264
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,424
were reasonable ways of framing 
existence has been badly damaged or 

265
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,484
called into question by the rise of 
scientific and materialistic and object 

266
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,524
to thinking.

267
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,410
So the psychological,
like the,

268
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,303
the,
the academic psychological response to 

269
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,690
that has been in many ways that,
well,

270
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:01,691
you're in framing only shields yourself 
shields you from the tragedy of being.

271
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,343
And that's what it is.
It's a defense mechanism and that's the 

272
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,250
terror management guys.
It's right.

273
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,084
Fundamentally,
your basic problem is that you're 

274
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:10,694
terrified of dying.
There's no other bloody thing that can 

275
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,030
be done about that.
So you have to,

276
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,033
you know,
put up shields of various sorts so that 

277
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:20,660
you're not constantly assaulted by that 
problem as you go through your life.

278
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,200
And it's a variant of Freudian theory.
So that's one theory.

279
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,140
And then there's a very,
a theory which is positive illusions,

280
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:27,974
you know,
which is the idea that it's closely 

281
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,634
related is that you can just delude 
yourself in an optimal way above the 

282
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,494
structure of being so that you can 
pretend that things are going to work 

283
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:41,570
out better for you than they probably 
are.

284
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,643
And then you don't have to be worried 
about the fact that it's tragic because 

285
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,320
you just concentrate on your 
simplistical optimistic,

286
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,750
you know,
illusions.

287
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,033
It's like no dozer am guessable theories
because they basically say that if you 

288
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,910
wait,
woke up and opened your eyes,

289
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,490
what you see would be so terrible that 
you would die,

290
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,560
you know,
or that you would want to die,

291
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,020
that it would drive you to suicide.
You know,

292
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:04,854
that's a,
you gotta be careful before you tell 

293
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:07,704
people that that sort of thing is true 
because you're undermining their 

294
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:14,190
capacity to live a genuine existence.
And you're also saying,

295
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,560
well,
you can't live a genuine existed because

296
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,960
the weight of it would be so heavy that 
it would.

297
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,203
It would destroy you,
or it will drive you into a position 

298
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:24,260
where you want it to be destroyed.
It's like,

299
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,313
well,
before we get so damn pessimistic about 

300
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,744
it,
we might start thinking about whether 

301
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,234
there are other phenomena that aren't 
illusory or delusional or defense 

302
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:36,900
mechanisms that actually are 
characterized by meaning.

303
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,800
And so one of the things I suggested to 
you at the beginning of class this class

304
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:49,170
was that you watched what you said to 
find out if what you said was making you

305
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,810
stronger or weaker and that you can 
actually feel that.

306
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,673
That's kind of a Rogerian idea because 
rogers would say that if what you're 

307
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:56,724
saying wasn't insane with your body 
being roughly speaking is Rogers was 

308
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:02,994
really gonna body theorists.
That you would feel that as a kind of 

309
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,570
discordance and then that weaken you.
And so it's a much.

310
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,730
It's a much older and deeper idea than 
that,

311
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,180
but Roger's articulated very well.
Well,

312
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,014
there's another.
There's another experiment that you can 

313
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:23,110
run that's also very much worth 
attending do,

314
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,340
which is watch and see what's 
meaningful.

315
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,650
Don't think about it.
Just notice,

316
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,543
notice when you're engaged in something 
enough so that the fact of you doing it 

317
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:38,940
is sufficient for the tax,
you know,

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,730
because you could say so thankful they 
come club this way.

319
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,563
Okay,
well you're a bounded creature and so 

320
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,470
you're.
You're beset on all sides by tragedy and

321
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,304
limitation.
You know now that might be necessary 

322
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,013
there.
There may be a reason why that's the 

323
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:53,934
case,
but we won't bother with that at the 

324
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,370
moment.
We'll talk about that later.

325
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,493
The question then is,
are there conditions under which you 

326
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:05,451
would regard that as acceptable and 
answer isn't what people think about.

327
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
That's the wrong answer.
The right answer is all.

328
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,080
Pay attention and notice if there are 
times like that,

329
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,420
and I think that's the.
That's horace,

330
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,490
that noticing,
that's the eye.

331
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,450
It's not thinking because it's not the 
framing process.

332
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,643
It's something outside of that.
It's something that's watching and I 

333
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:28,140
think if you notice,
you'll see if you go through your week,

334
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:31,290
you'll notice if you have to sort of 
stand outside yourself and think,

335
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,500
ha,
I was really into that.

336
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,540
I was pulled right inside it and then 
you see phenomenon that occur along with

337
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,530
that which chip and the hiatus detailed 
reasonably in his,

338
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,070
in his work on flow.
You don't notice the passing of.

339
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,820
You're not self conscious and the 
activity is sustaining.

340
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,790
You experienced it as sustain even 
though it might be difficult,

341
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,493
you know,
so it's not a matter of just take easy 

342
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,160
way out doing something fun.
It's not that at all.

343
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,023
It can be that it's often you feel that 
way when you're doing something that's 

344
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,074
exceptionally challenging and difficult 
and usually I think it's those things 

345
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:15,790
that are they're real in relationship to
your goal hierarchy,

346
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,803
you know,
so they're,

347
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,703
they're moving you forward in the way 
that you've determined that moving 

348
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,930
forward is appropriate in so far as 
you've sorted that out.

349
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,750
So you know a implies B and B in place.

350
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,583
See it,
see implies d and so forth and you've 

351
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,180
sorted that all out,
you know,

352
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,023
so maybe you're working on an essay in 
the class that you find meaningful 

353
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,804
because you want to derive something 
useful from your education so that 

354
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,520
you're a good citizen so that you can 
live a proper life,

355
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,383
you know,
and so the chaining of all those things 

356
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,293
makes the local activity quite richly 
meaningful because it's properly 

357
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,060
contextualized.
But then there's the other element which

358
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,210
is when you're pushing yourself beyond 
that,

359
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,313
not only do you experience the meaning 
of what you're doing in relationship to 

360
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,430
your goal hierarchy,
you also transcend the goal hierarchy at

361
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:05,140
the same time so that while you're 
working towards realizing it,

362
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,033
you're also working towards transforming
it and improving it all at the same 

363
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,374
time.
And I think that you're set up to 

364
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:17,050
experience that as as the highest form 
of being.

365
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,333
And then there's a corollary to that,
which is maybe if you spent the bulk of 

366
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:24,630
your time doing that,
you know,

367
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,220
so you've got practice data to you were 
doing it.

368
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,720
Maybe you're doing,
I don't know,

369
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,643
you could figure it out for yourself,
but my suspicions are that for many of 

370
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:33,364
you,
that's probably five percent of your 

371
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,254
weekly life.
Maybe I'm wrong about that because it's 

372
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,534
been a long time since I was your age.
I can't remember what it was like 

373
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,654
reading,
you know,

374
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,230
but I do know when I survey 
undergraduates and I asked them how much

375
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,030
time they waste,
you know,

376
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:49,864
they're telling me generally speaking,
it's four to six hours a day and I 

377
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,460
actually think it's probably more than 
that.

378
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,760
And so that's time not spent in this 
particular state of mind and it's wasted

379
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,564
time while you even recognize it as 
wasted time because when someone asks 

380
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,240
you if it's wasted time,
you say yes and it's like,

381
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,320
well wasted.

382
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,553
It's wasted and you know it.
You're obviously comparing that to some 

383
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,740
other sort of time that isn't wasted.
Right?

384
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,574
That you regard as valuable and 
meaningful and worth engaging and even 

385
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:19,744
though it might be difficult and require
discipline and all those sorts of 

386
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:24,100
things.
So you might ask yourself,

387
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:24,934
you know,
if you have times during the week where 

388
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:27,994
you were engaged in often what you're 
doing so that you find that 

389
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:33,730
intrinsically meaningful and it removes 
the burden of tragedy,

390
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,830
and I don't mean because you're 
preoccupied,

391
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,263
I mean because you're experiencing what 
you're doing as intrinsically worth the 

392
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,490
price.
That's a different thing.

393
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,841
You might think,
okay,

394
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,240
well what if you were in that of mind 80
percent,

395
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,680
85 percent of the time or 90 percent of 
the time,

396
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,080
you know,
and that requires a tremendous amount of

397
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:54,914
discipline and organization and clarity 
of purpose and it also requires a 

398
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:03,341
tremendous amount with the truth because
the enemy of setting yourself up so that

399
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,144
you can do that is untruth.
Because what happens is to the degree 

400
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,970
that you engage in on the truth,
you,

401
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,103
you contaminate your frames 
fundamentally and then you're in real 

402
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,204
trouble because you won't be oriented 
properly if you're afraid to 

403
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,073
contaminated.
They're contaminated to the degree that 

404
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,290
you build them out of nonsense in and 
delusion.

405
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
So yes,

406
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,080
absolutely agree with that.
And probably a natural state,

407
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,240
natural approaches.
The reciprocal.

408
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,403
No,
I think it's natural to be a chimpanzee 

409
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:51,774
is sitting in the jungle spending eight 
hours a day eating leaves because you 

410
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,990
know,
you're not smart enough to do any better

411
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:57,900
than that,
you know,

412
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,330
you know what I mean?
So,

413
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,880
so naturals.
The tough,

414
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,150
a tough conception.

415
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,810
Like I said,
I like restaurant.

416
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,180
I mean you could argue that,

417
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,880
oh absolutely.
You know,

418
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,733
sometimes you have fall asleep and 
sometimes the right thing to do is to 

419
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:15,270
have leisure time.
But I can tell you,

420
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,163
you know,
I know this from my own experience that 

421
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,990
an hour of actual leisure time beats a 
month of undeserved holiday.

422
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,000
And so I would say,
well,

423
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,250
what constitutes,
you know,

424
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,113
actual leisure time.
It's like you don't have anything that 

425
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,104
you shouldn't be doing at that moment.
That's more important than having a 

426
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,420
break.
And if there's nothing about that,

427
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,770
that self deceptive,
you know,

428
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,604
like you're on trying to escape from 
your responsibilities by watching a 

429
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:48,980
youtube video about joggers falling on 
the ice or something like that,

430
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,320
which apparently is quite a popular one 
at the moment.

431
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,400
So you know when you know perfectly well
that when you spend time like that,

432
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,234
especially if you're avoiding doing 
something that you've known that you 

433
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,920
should be doing using your own standards
of judgment,

434
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,350
that all it does is make you sick.

435
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,821
You know,
like there's a,

436
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,730
there's a physical revulsion that goes 
along with that.

437
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:09,470
And I think what,
what that is,

438
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:10,304
is your body telling you that you're 
contaminating your being by engaging in 

439
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:16,724
such low quality activity,
especially when there's something else 

440
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:23,510
that you know you should be doing.
And that's not restful.

441
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,613
I think that's extremely stressful 
because what happens is you basically 

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,280
tear yourself in to and why does it 
tyrant say you're useless?

443
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,240
And the other is like a critical notes 
off.

444
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,600
Say I can't help it,
you know,

445
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:39,530
when it's a terrible state of being to 
be in because you're a slave at the same

446
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,900
time and it's very,
very stressful.

447
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,960
It's not restful.
So you're talking to you.

448
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,803
It's like you're describing students how
to take a break and watch the show for 

449
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:54,790
the whole time.
Like going,

450
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,990
Gosh,
as you're constantly like,

451
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,443
you know,
and I think it takes real practice over 

452
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,010
years,
you know,

453
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:10,011
in part of what you'll be reading about 
in the book is the necessity of adopting

454
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:11,700
an apprenticeship,
you know,

455
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,534
because you have to focus yourself in on
something and really you have to focus 

456
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,274
in heart and you have to do it for quite
a long time before you have or yourself 

457
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,044
into a good enough shape so that you can
even start telling the difference 

458
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:29,841
between reasonable use of leisure time 
and pathological time wasting,

459
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,370
which are by no means the same thing.

460
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,190
And it's hard to get it right.
It's very hard to get it right.

461
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,670
I think you have to attend a lot 
internal cubes,

462
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,063
you know,
so if you're sitting in front of the 

463
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,680
screen and you're feeling somewhat 
uneasy,

464
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,260
if disgusted by yourself,
then you have to think,

465
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:49,740
okay,
just exactly what's going on here.

466
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,753
Am I being too hard on myself?
I actually need a break and I won't 

467
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,714
allow that because I'm a tyrant and so 
I'm sneaking one even though I'm tired 

468
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,364
and should ever break.
That's hard to get because then that 

469
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,670
would be an attitude issue,
right?

470
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,073
Are you have you conceptualize the 
necessity for leisure property and then 

471
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:13,470
the other possibility is while you're 
just being useless and you know it,

472
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,481
you know,
and,

473
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:16,740
and,
and then that shouldn't be happening.

474
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,574
Something else should be happy,
but it's by no means a straight forward 

475
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,180
thing to get those things right.

476
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,170
It's hard.
Now I have a hint about that,

477
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,613
you know,
because I've worked with lots of people 

478
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:28,734
who they're not wasting time,
like they're not wasting five minutes 

479
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,923
and sometimes because of the demand,
like usually because the demands on 

480
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:37,734
them,
they put themselves in a position where 

481
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:44,031
the demands on them are so high that if 
they waste anytime they will fail.

482
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,043
And so a typical person like that,
a lot of you are going to end up in 

483
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,660
those situations if you're lucky.
You know?

484
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,960
So a technical person like that as a 
challenging job.

485
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,213
So it's a complex job.
They have to manipulate a lot of 

486
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,000
variables constantly.
They have to be attentive and alert,

487
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,133
focused and conscientious.
And they have to do that for long 

488
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:08,490
periods of time,
like well up,

489
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,470
depends on the level of attainment 
you're after,

490
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:15,000
but if you want to attain at the peak of
your chosen discipline,

491
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,340
it's 60 to 80 hours a week and it's,
those are concentrated,

492
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,630
useful hours.

493
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,300
Now some are more useful than others 
because you're going to get tired,

494
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,780
but that's what you're aiming at.
And then you know,

495
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,510
well,
do you want to have kids?

496
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,630
That's a big issue too.
And if you want to do both of those,

497
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,230
it's like you don't get,
you don't have kind of wakes,

498
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,510
you don't have any time to waste,
you know?

499
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,344
And so then you have to get hyper 
efficient and then you have to ask 

500
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,710
yourself,
yeah,

501
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:49,480
but how much work should I do know 
what's the limit should like,

502
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,910
you know,
where is the right limit?

503
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,910
Well the answer to that is quite 
straightforward.

504
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,690
You can't work any harder than you can 
sustain across weeks,

505
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,490
months and years.
You know.

506
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,600
So some of the people that I've 
counseled who are hyper efficient,

507
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,290
one of the holes like fall into is they 
worked so hard.

508
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,603
They start getting inefficient and part 
of that is they're not paying attention 

509
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,510
to their family to guilty about their 
children.

510
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,033
Maybe their relationship is becoming 
unstable and that's going to cost them 

511
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,960
time.
Then like once you're married,

512
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:26,794
if you let that go and you get into a 
divorce battle and it's a custody 

513
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,650
battle,
you are screwed.

514
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,173
So like you have to really watch that 
and make sure it doesn't happen because 

515
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,550
it's like a major illness to have that 
happen.

516
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:40,384
It's not good and you know,
you never really recovered from it in 

517
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,280
some sense because you end up with a 
fractured,

518
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,170
you know,
you're close,

519
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:51,250
intimate relationships are fractured and
very difficult thing to do.

520
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,083
So up you're much more likely to get 
divorced in your second marriage than 

521
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,060
you were in your first.
So it would be like you could hop out of

522
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,190
one into a solution,
you know,

523
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,680
and then also people tired themselves 
out,

524
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,223
you know,
so often with the more hyper efficient 

525
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:06,814
people and often a lot of these people 
were women and I think the reason for 

526
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,710
that is,
you know,

527
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,723
once they have kids in particular,
they're really torn between two sets of 

528
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:16,744
fundamental obligations,
especially for the first three years of 

529
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,350
the kid's life,
you know.

530
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,184
And so it's really hard for them to get 
the balance rate at to figure out what 

531
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,233
that balance is.
But one rule is you got to treat 

532
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:32,200
yourself well enough so you can iterate 
your activities.

533
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,313
If you can be playing a degenerating 
game and it's a variant of the pig and 

534
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:40,090
the idea of the calibrating state,
right?

535
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,043
And it could have a great state will 
maintain itself and that can be within 

536
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:44,674
you or can be within a group of people 
or it can be either in you or within a 

537
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,750
group of people across a long span of 
time.

538
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,190
And that's really well equilibrate.
So a lot of the people that I dealt with

539
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,053
who were working themselves too hard,
we figured out ways they can take 

540
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,163
vacations.
They couldn't usually decreased the 

541
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,060
number of hours per week or per week 
wasn't possible.

542
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,343
Just the demands of the job,
like in the law firm or something like 

543
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:10,721
that.
You know,

544
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,700
you might think what Cathy,
just lighten up.

545
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:17,560
The answer to that is you don't get paid
$750 an hour for lightening up.

546
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,903
It's like you're on call right now 
whenever your client wants you and the 

547
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:23,760
answer isn't,
well,

548
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,000
you know,
I need to take a break.

549
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,963
Like then.
Then you don't get the pay because 

550
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:29,344
that's what they're paying is for.
But one of the things I noticed quite 

551
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,460
quickly was the people scheduled their 
time so they took more vacations.

552
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,190
The number of hours they can work 
productively actually went up,

553
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,130
not down.
So you can get the balance right,

554
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,140
but it's not.
It's not a simple thing to do,

555
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,633
but so isn't that.
You're only going to find engagement in 

556
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,274
sheer physical productive activity.
There's lots of places where you can be 

557
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,120
engaged,
you can be engaged in art,

558
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,340
you can be engaged in literature,
you've been engaged in relationships.

559
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,413
You can be engaged in your children like
there's no shortage of places of 

560
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:06,824
meaning,
but you have to interact with those 

561
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,054
places of meeting property and you have 
to organize the multiple places where 

562
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:16,874
you derive meaning in a manner that's 
sustaining to all of them and that's 

563
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:24,620
what you've got your grain right,
but getting your frame rate isn't enough

564
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,283
because you have to get your frame right
in a way that allows you to update your 

565
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,740
frame as you continue moving forward 
with it.

566
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,843
And I do believe because I do believe 
that the world that were adapted to as 

567
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:39,761
biological organisms is the world where 
reality is information.

568
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,280
I believe that when when your nervous 
system signals to you that all is well,

569
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,670
all is well.
It's true.

570
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,920
You're in the right place at the right 
time.

571
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,873
You're bearing exactly the right amount 
of load and the right amount of load is 

572
00:33:55,701 --> 00:34:00,701
enough to keep you talked and ready and 
improve,

573
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,743
and when you slip into that slot,
I think all of the existential problems 

574
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:08,760
that that,
that,

575
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,013
that arise to push people towards 
nihilism and hopelessness or or 

576
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:17,370
sometimes towards totalitarianism,
totalitarianism,

577
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,204
that rigidity,
that problem just goes away and it's 

578
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,890
because you solve it.
It's not because it's not a problem,

579
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,560
it's a bloody problem,
but that doesn't mean that you know,

580
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,503
because one of the things that monitor 
people do is they conceptualize 

581
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:33,974
themselves as the defeated aim priority.
You know that the fact that life is 

582
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:41,210
tragic and that you're not all you could
be in,

583
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:43,820
that everything will come to an end 
means that you're not.

584
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,370
By definition,
you're not up to the task.

585
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,190
It's like that's by no means obvious 
man.

586
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,370
People are tough,
like they're so tough.

587
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:53,204
It's unbelievable.
Why don't you know you see that on 

588
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:55,274
Youtube with you?
Because I don't want to look at Youtube 

589
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,110
now.
Now you can feel terrible above it.

590
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,483
One of the things I do like looking at 
it or the extreme sports that people 

591
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,630
engage in,
you know,

592
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,210
and I mean people can do unbelievable 
things.

593
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:10,850
They're completely,
they're completely off their rocker,

594
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,783
know they can do things with their 
bodies that you just can't possibly 

595
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,850
imagine.
I was looking for example at there was a

596
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:17,684
video that went around the wild ago 
about it was a video tape of the woman 

597
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:21,854
who won the 1956 I'm hurdling know we 
bounce off of one of those horses for 

598
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:29,684
gymnastics and so she did.
Her routine was videotaped and then the 

599
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,144
next video tape was over.
The person who won the gold in the 

600
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,184
Olympics at the last Olympics and it was
like the first woman did this really 

601
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,460
cool role,
often fall off the horse.

602
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,294
It was quite spectacular.
It's like the second one was like 20 

603
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,640
feet in the air with for flipped end 
over end,

604
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,100
you know,
vertically.

605
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,620
If they wasn't my favorite night and 
they weren't even the same creatures,

606
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,454
why don't look like some kind of kind of
like android kangaroo and the other 

607
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:01,560
book,
like a pretty competent gym teacher.

608
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,260
So you know,
I mean God only knows what the limits of

609
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:10,040
human ability are,
but we certainly haven't touched them.

610
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:10,874
And you guys,
most of you have no idea what you're 

611
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,643
capable of if you like,
if you really got your acts together 

612
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,553
when you were a force,
because another thing you might think 

613
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:20,874
about is maybe the existential misery 
that you experienced in your life is 

614
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,180
directly proportional to the amount of 
time you waste.

615
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,570
Because if,
if the dragon gardens a treasure,

616
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,660
you know,
and your job is to get the damn treasure

617
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,730
and you need it,
you need it.

618
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,360
It's not,
it's not optional without the treasury.

619
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,270
You don't have the riches necessary to 
live all the time.

620
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,104
You're wasting his time that you're not 
spent in the treasure room 

621
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,070
fundamentally.
And so,

622
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,163
you know,
if you're not spending all your time in 

623
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,050
the treasurer room,
you can't complain about being poor.

624
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,350
So it's a good thing to think about,
you know,

625
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,840
because it's,
and this is what makes it optimistic.

626
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,590
It's possible that if you utilize what 
was in front of you,

627
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,940
and so that will be the ground of being.
Let's say if you utilize that,

628
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,060
that would be enough,
or maybe you could get even really lucky

629
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,790
and if you utilize it properly,
it wouldn't just be enough.

630
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,450
That would be more than enough,
you know,

631
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:16,860
so you could go from say,
well,

632
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:20,000
it's okay to be a limited and mortal 
being too saying,

633
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,140
hey,
this is a pretty damn good deal and if I

634
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:23,820
could,
I'd sign on for it again.

635
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,880
That was actually niches,
idea of the eternal return,

636
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,210
you know,
so when he was trying to figure out what

637
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:34,010
people should do as a consequence of the
collapse of the ethical system,

638
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,500
it constituted classical religious 
belief.

639
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,730
He conjured up the idea of eternal 
return.

640
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,980
It was roughly this,
you should live in such a way so that if

641
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:48,330
you had to repeat what you were doing 
forever into infinity,

642
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
you would say yes to that.
And that's an,

643
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,163
that's an idea like the state,
except obviously it's stretched into 

644
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,500
huge expanses of time.
You know,

645
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,310
that's a high level thing to a map.
But you know,

646
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,000
so here's,
here's another example.

647
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,390
Like I've seen people who,
who get stuck in,

648
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,730
in very bureaucratic organizations,
you know,

649
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,100
and they just get bloody well tortured 
by death because it's mindless tyranny,

650
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,483
stupid rules and and on arbitrary 
decisions and counterproductive 

651
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:24,051
management advice and jealousy and 
punishment for doing well and you know,

652
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,553
everything you can do to possibly set up
a situation where the person who's got 

653
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:32,760
the jaw is just crushed by it,
that people won't say anything.

654
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,231
It's,
well,

655
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,970
what would happen if you said something 
like,

656
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,450
why do you want me to do this?
It looks stupid.

657
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,350
And they might be thinking,
Oh God,

658
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,380
I couldn't have thought it was stupid 
to,

659
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,450
you know,
but someone else told me to do it.

660
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,000
Highly probable that they would be 
thinking that.

661
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,403
It's like,
what happens if you just refused to do 

662
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,900
stupid,
useless meetings,

663
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,250
meaningless things.
It's like,

664
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,990
that's a rule.
I don't feel stupid.

665
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,030
Useless for me.
You know,

666
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,660
one of the things that happens in 
corporations,

667
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:05,710
and I've seen this happen many times,
is that the corporation gets.

668
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,043
It's like,
it's like an elephant that gets loaded 

669
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,680
with intestinal parasites.
And,

670
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,020
and I mean that.
I mean that as a biological analogy,

671
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,854
I really do,
because a corporation is a body in some 

672
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,064
sense.
It has a tremendous amount of building 

673
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:20,764
value and what can happen as the 
corporation develops as it gets full of 

674
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,160
people who just pull up the value,
they don't actually do anything.

675
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,110
They raped the brand is what they do 
because the brand has value.

676
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,973
You know,
like the Disney brand has value because 

677
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,650
it's associated with quality,
you know,

678
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,700
and if you want it to destroy that,
you take over the company and you've put

679
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:40,534
out snow white too and snow white three,
it's like five and snow white 12 until 

680
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,933
and everybody would buy it until like 
snow white 20 when they would trust you 

681
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,110
anymore.
And then you've sucked all the value out

682
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:53,650
of the company and its death,
you know,

683
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,603
or you get people who come into the 
corporation and all they want to do is 

684
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,414
maneuver up to the talk.
They don't give a damn about what the 

685
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:01,774
thing is supposed to be producing or 
about how they're structuring their 

686
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:08,920
relationships with other people or about
anything that has to do with the truth.

687
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:09,754
They use language instrumental to reach 
their goals and you get people like 

688
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,940
that,
your company and it's like it's dead.

689
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,203
It's gone.
And that happens to companies all the 

690
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:19,800
time because they don't last.
Right?

691
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,550
This is why Marx was wrong.
You know,

692
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,710
he said power and money accumulate in 
the hands of fewer and fewer people.

693
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,110
What he didn't say is it's always 
different.

694
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,280
People,
you know,

695
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:33,220
it's like there's a one percent,
but it's not the same people.

696
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,203
You know,
most family fortunes don't last three 

697
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:39,160
generations and neither do most large 
companies.

698
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,520
So there's a lot of dynamic turnover,
but you know,

699
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:44,260
you guys are going to be working in 
companies.

700
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:45,094
The Lord have you at at least at some 
point it pretty damn significant levels 

701
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:51,910
and even at an entry level,
you have more power than you think.

702
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,173
You know,
it is not necessary to do things you 

703
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,940
know are stupid and meaningless.
And if you're,

704
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,803
if,
if,

705
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,400
if the situation that you're in is 
demanding that,

706
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,090
then you might ask yourself,
hmm,

707
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,950
maybe I should be somewhere else.

708
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,390
And then you might say,
well,

709
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,283
I can't be.
What I would say to that is prepared to 

710
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:18,730
yourself to be like,
if you're going to go into a company and

711
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:22,420
you want to live ethically,
you need an escape strategy and you need

712
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:23,860
to have that along with you all the 
time,

713
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:27,720
so you need an updated resume and it 
need to be keeping your damn on,

714
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:32,500
on the job market so that you can see 
where the other opportunities along live

715
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,570
for you and so you're not afraid to 
pursue them.

716
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,793
You know,
so you got to hold your interview 

717
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:40,130
skills.
You've got to keep your damn resume on a

718
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,110
shot.
You've got to make sure you have a broad

719
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:44,300
social network and you have to do it 
consciously.

720
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,463
And so even if some Dane back tells you 
to do stump to something 

721
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,980
counterproductive,
meaningless,

722
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,600
and we'll push it one step farther than 
clearly unethical,

723
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,320
you can say no and you can meet it 
because no means I'm not doing that.

724
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,273
And if you push me,
we'll either have a war or I'll go 

725
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:04,200
somewhere else.
It's like,

726
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,620
that's what no means.
That that's what it means.

727
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,723
It means I'm not doing this and you 
can't say no till you haven't an 

728
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,201
alternative,
right?

729
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,034
You have to set yourself up so that no 
doesn't kill you because obviously then 

730
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,894
you won't say it needed.
These are important things to consider 

731
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,013
because the actions that you take up,
the level of your individual career are 

732
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:29,180
going to have far more impact on the 
ethics and the productivity of the place

733
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:30,014
that you worked and then you can imagine
especially if you're someone who's 

734
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,793
straight and sees what's right in front 
of their face because those are the 

735
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,430
people that keep the data companies 
running and there's not necessarily that

736
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:41,264
many of them know the prices.
Law Rule is that square root of the 

737
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,470
number of people who are doing your job 
do half the work.

738
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,650
So you could say that in a company of a 
thousand people,

739
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,513
30 people are doing half the work.
You know when you could be one of them 

740
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:56,474
and then if you are one,
except you can bloody well say no 

741
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,313
because they actually need you and so 
your last would be can be a catastrophe 

742
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,543
and that's what you want to aim for.
It's like you want to be the person 

743
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:09,344
who's lost would be a catastrophe 
because then you've got some power and 

744
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:15,860
then you can bargain and then you don't 
have to do a stupid,

745
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,210
useless crooked things and you'll have a
much better life if you don't have to do

746
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:23,270
those things.
So very,

747
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:24,860
very practical advice.

748
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,473
So when you were talking about how like 
divorce and like if you have a family 

749
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,903
and you have like a divorced people 
sometimes never thought into that and I 

750
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,520
remember you saying that it is locked 
before too.

751
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,910
So what do you think about that?
It's so horrible and what am I people to

752
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,370
come?

753
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,200
Okay,
well let's think about this for a minute

754
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,800
then what?
We'll go back to the symbolic stuff.

755
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,280
How many chances do you think you'll 
have in your life for it?

756
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:03,270
For like a serious high quality intimate
relationship?

757
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,093
What do you guys think?
How many chances are you going to have 

758
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,110
for that?
Okay,

759
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,430
that's good.
That's good.

760
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:16,010
I would say probably top out in a boat.
Okay,

761
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,720
so that's not that many chances.
You get old quick.

762
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,343
You know by the time you're 45 you're 
not going to have a family and the well 

763
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:36,780
you can do that sometimes if you're male
or female maybe,

764
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,380
but it gets pretty rough and you're 
looking probably at that point you had a

765
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:44,340
fair bit of in vitro and that sort of 
interactions top.

766
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:48,090
It's hard on people so you know,
not only you not have that many chances,

767
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:51,240
you don't have that much time,
so you're going to get it right.

768
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,500
So if you get it wrong and costs you 
like maybe it'll cost you five years,

769
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,880
five years is a long time,
so and three,

770
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:00,714
five year cost,
you lost things there that you can't 

771
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:07,120
replace.
Okay.

772
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,983
So that's one part of it is you don't 
have that many chances and it's costly 

773
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:14,380
to to burn up the time.
Okay.

774
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,560
The second thing is,

775
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,520
okay,

776
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,880
divorce is very complicated,
like it's not so bad if you get divorced

777
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,780
to someone who's reasonable,
but often the reason that you're getting

778
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:30,614
divorced is that one or the other or 
both of you aren't that reasonable and 

779
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,204
what that might mean.
You might be negotiating with someone 

780
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,970
whose basic goal is to make sure that 
you don't have another day of success in

781
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,090
the next 20 years and if that's their 
goal,

782
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,390
they will attain it.
So,

783
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,224
and there's lots of ways people do that 
and they usually do it by owning the 

784
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:54,290
children hostage.
People will definitely do that.

785
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,330
They do it all the time,
you know,

786
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,080
so you want to avoid that and then you 
know,

787
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:03,080
then of course it's hard on the 
relationship you have with your children

788
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,303
and like that's.
Those are probably the most important 

789
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,460
relationships you have in your life.
You know,

790
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:13,190
it's like might be parents,
might be siblings,

791
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,790
might be your partner,
might be your kids.

792
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,740
But I think when it comes right down to 
it,

793
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,293
your parents are old and so were you.
When your kids aren't and they're just 

794
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:28,490
as close.
Plus they need you and so will you start

795
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,990
twisting and messing.
Not About,

796
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,700
boy,
it's hard on your psyche.

797
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,490
It's hard on the kids too,
so you know.

798
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,090
So then I'm just thinking about that and
how that's a cost.

799
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,380
If you,
if you mess it up like a five year cost,

800
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,040
they cost you,
right?

801
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,143
Oh,
and it might be a 15 year cost if you 

802
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:48,600
were in a custody battle and cost you a 
quarter of a million dollars,

803
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,460
right?
Yeah.

804
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:54,420
But like is it then would you say like 
being a psychologist,

805
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,283
that it's better for people to like 
pursue a relationship that's not good 

806
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,363
enough to continue to do that and 
possibly incur further costs than it is 

807
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,490
to just cut it off because it would 
divorce.

808
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,210
Okay.
It's a complicated question.

809
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,443
What I would say is don't make the kind 
of mistakes that get you into such a 

810
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,040
stupid relationship to begin with.
Okay.

811
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,060
Because that's the answer to that 
question.

812
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,223
And the way you do that is by trying not
to delude yourself any more than is 

813
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:22,154
absolutely necessary.
And that means when you're in the damn 

814
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:25,874
relationship,
tell the person the truth and trying to 

815
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:32,500
figure out what the truth for you and 
don't put up with any nonsense and stand

816
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,800
up for yourself and also aimed towards 
the good,

817
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,900
you know,
if you do all those things,

818
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:41,890
then your relationship is probably going
to work if you're trying to do all those

819
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:42,724
things really,
and you have a partner that will not do 

820
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,960
that,
then leave.

821
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,513
But

822
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,243
it's a rare person who will do that if 
they're stepped along the way property 

823
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:56,600
and they learn how to do it.
Now,

824
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:57,434
not everyone's like that because you do 
run into some people who are basically 

825
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,130
devoted towards mayhem and trouble,
you know.

826
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,143
But usually you know,
a person is a balance of striving for 

827
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:11,380
the good and you know,
messing about in the health.

828
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,920
And you know,
you're both like that.

829
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:16,790
When you start a relationship and you 
try to tilt it towards the good and then

830
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,620
you will run into that problem.
So.

831
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:21,350
But you have to do that right from the 
beginning of the relationship.

832
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,213
You know,
it doesn't take that much to corrupt a 

833
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:26,630
relationship so that it's not really 
salvageable.

834
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,020
It the mistakes.
Three or four acts of infidelity,

835
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,633
your doctor,
you don't get to come back from that 

836
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:34,304
because the fundamental element of trust
is being removed and then you can 

837
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:38,174
communicate with the person because you 
don't know if they're telling you the 

838
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:40,454
truth and then you don't know if you're 
dealing with reality and if you're not 

839
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:46,760
dealing with reality with your partner,
it's like good luck fixing that.

840
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,050
It's like you're working on a ghost car.
Well the real one is sitting in the shop

841
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,913
with the motor on it.
You know it's not going to get you 

842
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:54,334
anywhere.
So a lot of the issue is don't get into 

843
00:48:56,541 --> 00:49:00,050
trouble to begin with.
If you are in the trouble,

844
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,890
well then you try to straighten yourself
out and see if you can fix it.

845
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,210
Well,
if you can't,

846
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,820
your options aren't great and it depends
on the particularities of the situation.

847
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,470
Not Know I have people that I counseled.
It's like leave that person and the role

848
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:16,304
is they're lying to you.
They aren't aiming up and you won't be 

849
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:28,181
able to tolerate being with them for 10 
years without becoming resentful,

850
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,170
alcoholic and homicide,
so that's a bad outcome.

851
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,660
There's nothing you can do to avoid it,
so you might as well leave and.

852
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,750
But you know,
you'd have to have.

853
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:41,300
That sort of note has to be the truth 
because it's no fun.

854
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,470
It's no good to leave someone who's 
struggling in an alert.

855
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,201
You know,
when you think,

856
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:46,340
well,
I'm with this person.

857
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,110
They're not going anywhere.
You know,

858
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:51,110
maybe they have an alcohol problem and 
they're resentful.

859
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,940
It's like,
but I'm all they've got,

860
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,823
well,

861
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,543
they bloody well better want to have to 
fix that because you're not going to 

862
00:49:59,051 --> 00:49:59,884
deal with fixed.
All that'll happen is you'll end up in 

863
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:06,270
the same place.
Now if they really want to fix more than

864
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,104
anything and they're willing to tell the
truth about it and willing to interact 

865
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:13,590
with you,
then there's a ghost of a chance.

866
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:14,940
You might pull through it,

867
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,223
but

868
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:17,983
it's very hard to fix someone and it's 
really hard to fix someone who does not 

869
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:23,450
want to be fixed and there's lots of 
people like that.

870
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,120
So my

871
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,660
parents divorced,
so,

872
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,300
um,
I know that a lot of failing,

873
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,193
you're marketing the kid if you.
And I've had to deal with a lot of the 

874
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,030
tension,
which is like choosing your parents.

875
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,140
But um,
when everyone asks like,

876
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:46,780
do you like something?
Lawyers?

877
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,710
I'm like,
I,

878
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,893
I see how much they fight now.
And I can't imagine having that happen 

879
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,970
like school,

880
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,080
an answer to the question.
It depends on the particular situation.

881
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,393
And so a lot,
there's lots of situations where a 

882
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:08,790
general answer doesn't suffice,
but I would say it is.

883
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,870
This is a tough one.
I can tell you what's happened since the

884
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:15,290
divorce law.
Scott are liberalized.

885
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,013
The first thing that happens is that all
of you are going to be divorced and 

886
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:21,774
about the same rate as people would have
been two years ago because rich people 

887
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:28,260
still get married and they generally 
don't get divorced.

888
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,820
Poor people do not get married and 
that's like 60 percent of the population

889
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:37,770
and it's ramping up quick and there's no
evidence whatsoever that that's anything

890
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:42,690
but catastrophic.
So kids who are raised by single parents

891
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,090
do not do as well.
Now,

892
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,043
that doesn't mean there aren't some 
single parents who are doing a stellar 

893
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:49,254
job,
obviously neurons and there's some 

894
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,680
married parents to do a terrible job.

895
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,693
That's not the issue.
The issue is the bulk of the evidence 

896
00:51:58,261 --> 00:51:59,094
and the bulk of the evidence strongly 
suggests that children who are raised 

897
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,560
with two parents do better.
Well,

898
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,510
why?
Well,

899
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:08,910
why?
It's impossible to raise children.

900
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,620
Jesus,
they're expensive,

901
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,540
they're troubleshooting,
they're smart,

902
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,420
and they're useless.
You know,

903
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,680
so,
and you've got them for 20 years.

904
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:18,570
It's like you're going to do that by 
yourself.

905
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,930
Sure.
You are near to be working at a horrible

906
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:25,230
job.
Forty hours a week or more like a retail

907
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:26,064
job for example,
where they just treat you like a slave 

908
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:31,200
and then you're going to go home to your
miserable kids because I lost it.

909
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,900
It's like,
that's not fun and you know,

910
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,290
it's increasingly the norm for huge 
chunks of our population,

911
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,800
like elitist liberal types,
like all of you,

912
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,320
for example,
don't pay much attention to what happens

913
00:52:43,321 --> 00:52:46,290
to people who were actually core,
but as far as I can tell,

914
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,090
it's been a bloody catastrophe for them.

915
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,183
You know,
there's an old saying when the upper 

916
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:51,944
class gets a cold,
the lower class gets pneumonia and you 

917
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,250
know,
the thing about that same.

918
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,110
It's true.
It's like,

919
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,210
it's not a metaphor.
It's literally the case.

920
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:02,370
If an epidemic sweeps through a Barbie 
relation,

921
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,800
the population dies from the poor 
people.

922
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:08,670
Awkward because they're so damn stress.
So,

923
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,140
you know,
I would say with regards to marriage and

924
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:18,141
I'd been married long time sister both 
26 years now and I've noticed a bunch of

925
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:23,490
things about marriage.
One is two brains are better than one.

926
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,200
So if you communicate with your partner 
because they're not like you,

927
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,830
it's like you have a corpus callosum 
between you,

928
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,173
you know,
and they'll tell you things you don't 

929
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,900
understand.
You know,

930
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,050
like when you're being stupid,
you know,

931
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:39,923
in a typically feminine way.
Sarah typically masculine way or 

932
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,223
whatever,
stupid way you managed to be stupid to 

933
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,200
you and that can be really helpful even 
though it's extremely annoying,

934
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,720
you know,
and they can help you make decisions and

935
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:52,590
they're a good place to.

936
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,260
They're good place to confess to,
you know,

937
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:56,094
and it's really helpful when you're 
trying to figure out how to discipline 

938
00:53:57,691 --> 00:53:58,524
children so that you're not a pathetic 
milk saw who lets them run all over you 

939
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:02,784
or some tire or who you know,
likes to beat them with a stick when 

940
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,090
they sneeze,
you know,

941
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,953
hopefully you kind of find some pleasant
middle ground in there and it's a lot 

942
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,970
easier to do that with two people in 
with one and then they can spell you off

943
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:15,804
when you're exhausted.
Particularly useful if you have small 

944
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,970
children because you will be exhausted 
when you have small children,

945
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,423
you know,
plus the narrative of your life as 

946
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:27,150
continuity.
And that's nice.

947
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,400
You know,
and if your home is set up properly,

948
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:31,410
it's actually a pleasure to go to it.
You know,

949
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:32,244
it is that it is a buttress against the 
chaotic and uncaring external world 

950
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:40,430
because the external world in many ways,
it doesn't give a damn both you,

951
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,013
you know,
so if you go home and it's set up 

952
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:44,790
reasonably well,
it's like,

953
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,130
Hey,
you've got somewhere to belong.

954
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,960
That's not so bad.

955
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,520
Just uh,
another,

956
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,400
um,
related situation that as growth,

957
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,130
personal relevance for other people to 
do that,

958
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,670
um,
in,

959
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,910
in many situations like when something 
bad happens,

960
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,031
you know,
okay,

961
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:03,864
yeah,
I've got to do some kind of imperative 

962
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:05,270
thing.
Right.

963
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,540
And uh,
so say it's like a health scare and go,

964
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,190
can I go work on my diet?
And then it's a divorce.

965
00:55:10,191 --> 00:55:10,641
It's like,
all right,

966
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:11,474
we want to go and work through why I 
didn't think I was headed for divorce 

967
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,830
for the last 20 years,
but now it just happened.

968
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,660
And,
but,

969
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,793
but in some situations people building 
out repair but they don't want to get 

970
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,500
them to actually be repairing.
So they go to people who are specialists

971
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,240
in other areas of,
of life,

972
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,213
personal,
psychological dealers and stuff like 

973
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:30,830
that.
Anything but divorce,

974
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:34,820
like attention deficit work on your 
scopes or like work on these,

975
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,793
uh,
or like assertiveness training or 

976
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:38,970
something like that.
But like they're,

977
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,140
they're like,
they're diligently avoiding the heart of

978
00:55:42,141 --> 00:55:42,974
the methods.

979
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,410
And what was your major

980
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,500
and if you were in a family with 
somebody like that,

981
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,573
is there something like that?

982
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,531
Well,
you know,

983
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:52,610
some situations are like Humpty dumpty,
right?

984
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,510
There's no putting it back together now.
But again,

985
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:59,970
in terms of avoidance of those 
situations,

986
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,590
like you think about that hierarchy.
Yeah.

987
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,033
Well divorce is a low resolution,
high impact solution because it just 

988
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:08,184
tears a chunk of that hierarchy out,
throws in the way that's a lot and it's 

989
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,410
cost,
it's going to hurt you.

990
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,120
Okay.
So then you think,

991
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:15,690
well,
what,

992
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,523
what might you do instead of that?
The real answer is solve the damn 

993
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:21,390
problems as they arise.
You know?

994
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,460
And that's hard and it requires drilling
down.

995
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,900
It really requires drilling down.
So one of the things I want to build,

996
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:30,630
for example,
which I haven't yet,

997
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,430
it's Kinda like going to be like this 
future authoring thing that you guys do.

998
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,190
I want to build a problem solving matrix
for,

999
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,020
for compost because like,
because at the end,

1000
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,000
here's how not to get divorced from your
wife,

1001
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,240
figure out how to set the table 
properly.

1002
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,090
Now what does that mean?
It's really,

1003
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:52,240
really complicated and it's like,
who's going to cook?

1004
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,360
When are they going to cook?
Why are they cooking?

1005
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,780
How should you respond to it?
Who buys groceries?

1006
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,960
What are the groceries going to be?
Who's going to put them away?

1007
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,243
How do you say thanks when someone does 
something for you in the domestic 

1008
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:09,730
environment and what's happened,
and this is part of the depth of God,

1009
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:12,970
roughly speaking,
is that the roles are gone.

1010
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,183
Okay?
And what that means is you better be 

1011
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:17,044
awake because it turns out that running 
a kitchen in a house is unbelievably 

1012
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:22,684
complicated and difficult,
and so you have to negotiate how to do 

1013
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:30,460
it and you're a terrible negotiator.
You don't know how to decompose the damn

1014
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:32,530
problem to the point where you could 
solve it.

1015
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,340
You won't admit what you want.
You won't admit what your life,

1016
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,010
you won't pay any attention to what 
actually irritates you.

1017
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,373
You know,
so you'd like to think that you're nice 

1018
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,150
and easy to get along with,
but you're not,

1019
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,340
you're basically Hitler,
you know,

1020
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,600
and so until you realize that you can't 
even tell your partner what you want.

1021
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,820
And so this is where philosophy hits the
road or hits the ground,

1022
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,780
you know,
it's like trying to negotiate,

1023
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,623
you know,
to stable solution to how you're going 

1024
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:02,380
to run the kitchen because that's where 
the battle between the sexist,

1025
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,223
by the way,
there's two places where it really hits 

1026
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:11,800
one who's going to take care of the 
little kids to,

1027
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,460
to who is going to work in the kitchen 
and under what circumstances.

1028
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,480
It's like you figure those things out.
You can consider yourself a philosopher,

1029
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:26,903
a very difficult.
And the cost for not doing it is low 

1030
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:36,520
quality food in a hostile environment,
bratty children that you hate,

1031
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,280
resentment,
hostility,

1032
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,293
the accumulation of insults at assaults 
and either a divorce or really unhappy 

1033
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,390
marriage.
So,

1034
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,580
but what did.
But just to take it back,

1035
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,073
what do you do when somebody has a,
like to use a metaphor like has it 

1036
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:55,504
helped care?
And then there was like say the cancer 

1037
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,193
and then instead of quitting smoking,
they just started taking a multivitamin 

1038
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,590
in the morning.
It's like,

1039
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,633
what do you do if you're watching 
somebody treat their smoking with an 

1040
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,490
antibiotic was a multivitamin rather 
than

1041
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,623
then you go to war three.
I'm not kidding you tighten them into 

1042
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:17,250
doing what you have.
But a war isn't just like you fly into a

1043
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:18,680
rage and you know,
throw dishes,

1044
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,370
explaining,
that's not helpful.

1045
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,960
No worries.
Okay,

1046
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,110
you are not going to smoke anymore.
And so then you think,

1047
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:29,180
okay,
well what do you have to do to do that?

1048
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,820
So maybe it's your father,
um,

1049
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,090
I'm going to call you everyday and 
harass you.

1050
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,013
And if that doesn't work then I'm going 
to come over and harassed and I'm going 

1051
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,723
to burn up all your cigarettes.
And then I'm going to get your friends 

1052
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,194
to come over and tell you that you're a 
bloody idiot and I'm going to put 

1053
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,250
pressure on you.
And your mom's going to help too.

1054
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,190
And if you don't quit smoking,
she's going to leave.

1055
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,020
It's like it's life or death.

1056
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,180
What's it going to be?
Now,

1057
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,250
you know,
you may say you don't want to go to war,

1058
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,190
you might also say that it's not even 
your right to go to war,

1059
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,593
but if you're faced with a situation 
where it's someone you love is engaging 

1060
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:04,400
in a behavior that seriously 
counterproductive,

1061
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:05,623
it's like your ratchet up the pressure 
until they stop or you can't stand it 

1062
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,560
anymore and if you can't stand it 
anymore,

1063
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,900
you lose,
you know,

1064
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,940
lots of things are a war and so you and 
you have to be prepared for a book like,

1065
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,880
because that's also a very,
to begin with to say no,

1066
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,363
you know,
videos got offended in a way to take it 

1067
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,194
back to you.
You're getting is that like you got to 

1068
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:31,460
find it in a way that you can continue 
to have these battles so that it doesn't

1069
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,550
just become a failed enterprise and the 
first conversation,

1070
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:35,384
right.
If you can blow apart the whole 

1071
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:36,990
relationship,
you know,

1072
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,730
and the personal do that to you too.
They'll,

1073
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:39,680
they'll often say,
well,

1074
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,360
you can quit,
but if you don't start biting me,

1075
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,950
I'm never going to talk to you again.
I'm like,

1076
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,040
you can't be afraid of that sort of 
thing.

1077
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,730
It's like if you can also tell them the 
difficult,

1078
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,000
that's an inappropriate move.

1079
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,100
It's a nuclear bomb.
It's like,

1080
01:00:55,101 --> 01:01:00,101
don't bring up the nuclear bombs yet.
Johnson and the will say,

1081
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,813
look,
I don't need to get health tips from 

1082
01:01:02,921 --> 01:01:03,681
you.
I'm the parent.

1083
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:05,720
I'm telling you what's healthy to eat or
whatever.

1084
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,910
You shouldn't be able to respond to 
that.

1085
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,073
That's just a.
that's just an entry level volume that 

1086
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,690
you're the parents.
Oh,

1087
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,211
well,
hey,

1088
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:18,370
that's a brilliant observation.
Would say,

1089
01:01:18,371 --> 01:01:19,130
well,
these things,

1090
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,340
issues or whatever,
sending my personal romantic sexual life

1091
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:23,174
that like,
I'm not comfortable sharing things with 

1092
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,670
you,
so yeah.

1093
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,820
Well you can tell them that you're not 
comfortable living with the consequences

1094
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:29,654
of their stupid decisions and you're 
stuck with it too because you know the 

1095
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:32,990
personal say,
well,

1096
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,630
this is me.
Well,

1097
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:36,290
yeah,
right,

1098
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,200
except you're connected to.
He's connected to your mother,

1099
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:40,034
let's say,
and they're both connected to you and 

1100
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:42,830
they're all connected to their friends.

1101
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,880
It's like,
sorry,

1102
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:45,860
this isn't just about you.
You know,

1103
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:46,694
if you're on an island,
while even then it wouldn't just be 

1104
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:51,140
about you,
but it would be more of a use.

1105
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:55,130
So that's just weak argumentation and 
what people will do when you're having a

1106
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:58,430
war with them is they'll have like 10 or
11 prepared responses.

1107
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,220
They're always cliches,
you know,

1108
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,320
and so you just back that way,
they're just cliche.

1109
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,091
It's like,
okay,

1110
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:07,730
well first of all we're going to get 
through the cliches,

1111
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,833
but then what happens?
Then they get math and then they'll 

1112
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:13,190
stomp away.
Then they'll cry.

1113
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,140
It's like if you can get through all 
that,

1114
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,270
well then maybe you can have a 
discussion,

1115
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,750
you know,
and then.

1116
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,360
But you got to think it through.
You actually care if you're parked,

1117
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,330
if you're a person is smoking themselves
today.

1118
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,410
Of course I love it.

1119
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,260
It's like,
yeah,

1120
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,630
sure you make.
It's like,

1121
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,910
why is it important to you?
Why does it work?

1122
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,000
Why does it matter?
Why is it worth going to war about it?

1123
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,940
And you need to know that you need to 
know it and you have to be able to tell.

1124
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,360
But first,
you know,

1125
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:42,194
and if you could tell them that if you 
could really figure it out and you can 

1126
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:45,204
really tell them that there's,
sometimes they'll listen because they 

1127
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:48,984
don't,
they don't want to know that they're 

1128
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:53,460
tearing you apart,
you know,

1129
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,930
and they're going to do everything not 
to see that it's my problem.

1130
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,733
Yeah,
well I wish it wasn't a problem because 

1131
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:02,430
then I wouldn't have to worry about it,
but unfortunately,

1132
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,663
you know,
or fortunately we're tied together at 

1133
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:06,264
the bottom of the barrel so you know,
we better figure out how to deal with 

1134
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:09,240
this.

1135
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,073
So it's very hard thing to do and it's 
way better to address those things 

1136
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,274
before they become catastrophic because 
by the time they've gotten to the point 

1137
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,180
where it's a 15 year problems,
it's like Jesus,

1138
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,590
you're dealing with a very large tire.
Matt,

1139
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,920
at that point,
you know.

1140
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,763
So one of the things I really liked 
about the Mesopotamian creation myth is 

1141
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:31,710
that it tells you what happens if you 
muck around,

1142
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,843
you know,
it says,

1143
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,850
because remember that Mesopotamian gods,
they kill app suit,

1144
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:37,920
right?
That's the structure they all rest on.

1145
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,053
So it's just this sort of a hollow steel
shell now and the end now things alive 

1146
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:45,750
and being fixed.
No one's paying attention.

1147
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,500
What comes,
what happens on the longer that goes on,

1148
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,350
the bigger the monster that makes its 
appearance,

1149
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,543
you know,
and you could easily be in a situation 

1150
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:57,450
where the boxster that people are hiding
from his.

1151
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,410
So Cam being you may not have the skills
to kill it.

1152
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,151
So,
you know,

1153
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:07,890
even remember horace,
when he goes off that off after I'm sad,

1154
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,830
he loses an eye.
It's like it's no joke,

1155
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:11,903
you know,
and he's a god and he wins and he still 

1156
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:16,050
loses.
Not So,

1157
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,180
you know,
with someone who's smoking,

1158
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:19,014
you know,
one of the things you may have to 

1159
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:22,650
confront is their absolute cynicism 
about life.

1160
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,353
Seriously thought through.
And there's plenty of reasons to be 

1161
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:30,780
cynical about life and resentful and 
full of hate and all of those things.

1162
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:32,100
You know,
so,

1163
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,970
so you,
the bigger the war that clear the head,

1164
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,550
you know,
because you're going to hit,

1165
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,140
you're going to find the monsters 
underneath the problem.

1166
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,200
And they're usually archetypal.
You know,

1167
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:44,034
I've been in lots of situations with my 
clients where the only language that 

1168
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:47,514
could be used to describe what was going
on was religious because the problems 

1169
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:51,594
were so deep,
like there's so good against evil that 

1170
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,710
there isn't any other language that's 
even close to powerful enough,

1171
01:04:58,711 --> 01:04:59,544
and that's usually what happens in 
households where there's a truly 

1172
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,580
homicidal battle going on.
Like a deep full problem for example.

1173
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,900
And if were you in my personality class,
you watch crumb.

1174
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,260
Oh yeah,
that's intense.

1175
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:16,103
If you want to see psychological about 
the kind you wouldn't see normally 

1176
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,334
unless you were a clinician and like a 
clinician who was really into the 

1177
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:28,070
situation crumbled Kelly.
It's available online.

1178
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:33,710
You probably have to rent,
but it's the pathology and that families

1179
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:38,881
are critical and it's rough.
Oh yeah.

1180
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,450
Brilliant documentary.
The guy that made the documentary to the

1181
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:48,760
family.
Yes.

1182
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:50,470
Beforehand.
So they laid a band,

1183
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,480
you know,
and they were also nurse assistance.

1184
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,413
Yeah.
That's kind of like what a monstrous 

1185
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,040
animal looks like right away.
Like that.

1186
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,600
He had like this,
he had this very large,

1187
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,850
like clean mother.
I don't know,

1188
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,073
it's was quite the creature.
She was sort of like this monstrous 

1189
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:17,614
creature and so all of his restaurants,
we sort of like it and so all of his 

1190
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:23,824
drawings were like if these monstrous 
like monster swimming with him as a 

1191
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:29,920
parasitical appendage.

1192
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,630
Right.
That's the Freudian storyboard.

1193
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,623
If you don't think that's real,
you haven't looked at any pathological 

1194
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,160
families because it's re.
Freud's claim was.

1195
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,090
That's the first battle that people 
fighting.

1196
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,760
If you lose,
there's a think about it.

1197
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:47,830
Here's some battles you got to get away 
from your mother to get to kindergarten.

1198
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,560
Great.
That's about it.

1199
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:50,394
Number one,
and then you've got to make friends 

1200
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,360
that's bad enough to and then you've got
to get away from your family.

1201
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,810
It's like in the eatable situation,
you don't win the first battle,

1202
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,013
your screw and it's worse even because 
the reason you don't is because there's 

1203
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:07,114
something about one or both parents that
is bloody well doing everything it 

1204
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,750
possibly can to make sure that you don't
and you think,

1205
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:14,800
well,
that's pretty dark.

1206
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:18,130
Who would ever believe that?
But it's like you failed in your life in

1207
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:19,930
a serious way.
You know,

1208
01:07:19,931 --> 01:07:22,990
and you're resentful and irritable,
miserable about it.

1209
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:27,310
What makes you think you're going to 
facilitate your child's success?

1210
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,293
What makes you think you're going to be 
able to stand to see someone thrive 

1211
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,630
where you failed?
It's like,

1212
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:35,320
yeah,
right.

1213
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,153
If you were that kind of safe,
you wouldn't have failed to begin with 

1214
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,700
no one in that particular away.
So you know,

1215
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,310
families can be just.

1216
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,080
Freud was a smart man and you know,
if you watched chrome,

1217
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:48,730
you can see exactly what he was talking 
about.

1218
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,564
Some very,
very difficult to get access to that 

1219
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:51,634
kind of experience.
Unless you happen to be in that 

1220
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:54,154
situation or you know,
you're helping someone cope with it and 

1221
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:59,620
you're really tied in.
So.

1222
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:04,710
And that's a perfect segue to the great 
mother.

1223
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,160
Now.
So the hypothesis here is that,

1224
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,510
that,
you know,

1225
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:14,020
what's complex hypothesis,
but the hypothesis fundamentally is that

1226
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:18,230
your basic ways that you break down 
being as such,

1227
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,510
which I would say is,
is,

1228
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,573
is represented symbolically by these 
ceramic tile forums that have the 

1229
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,244
capacity to be spiritual or to be,
to reveal the treasure because you're a 

1230
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:32,420
social primate and you sort of a nuclear
family,

1231
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:33,440
social,
primate,

1232
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,170
your primary cognitive categories are 
male,

1233
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,760
female,
I think it's male,

1234
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:38,870
female,
and child,

1235
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,063
and the child tends to take on the 
aspect of the sun like the male child 

1236
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,960
for reasons that we'll go into.

1237
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,770
But,
um,

1238
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,460
and I think it's,
I think it's because of the overwhelming

1239
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,294
reality of the feminine throughout 
history has been the feminine in 

1240
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:57,920
relationship to procreation is the 
defining characteristic of the feminine.

1241
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:01,340
And so you can define the feminine with 
femininity,

1242
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,174
but if you're going to define the child 
whose relationship isn't primarily 

1243
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,403
appropriative known as a child,
you don't use feminine symbolism to do 

1244
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,760
that.
So it makes it complicated.

1245
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,070
It doesn't map.
So here's an example of that.

1246
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:18,220
So there's a um,
you see that sound a herb roast chicken.

1247
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,330
This is interesting.
I have one of these up in my office.

1248
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:26,360
Wouldn't any of you guys come up and see
what I found?

1249
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:29,480
One in Mexico or actually someone found 
it and I bought it from them.

1250
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,900
Maybe not next to,
but whatever.

1251
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,000
It's exactly one of these things.
It's so cool,

1252
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:37,400
except it's got legs at the bottom and 
it stands out.

1253
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,160
It's this,
except it's chicken with a snake wrapped

1254
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:41,600
around its neck.
You know,

1255
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,980
Scott,
please wait.

1256
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:45,280
He's off to the side and on each wing is
a spider web,

1257
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,420
which I really love.
It's absolutely perfect.

1258
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,254
And so it's an archetypal image in the 
image of something like you see in the 

1259
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:54,590
US too with the snake that the US often 
used for.

1260
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:57,570
The Americans often use that flag.
It's like an eagle with a snake and it's

1261
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,453
talents.
That's another variant of the same sort 

1262
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:01,034
of assembled and it's,
it's this combination of matter and 

1263
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,550
spirit,
burden,

1264
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,960
burden,
reptile,

1265
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,380
and it does represent the ground of 
being all things considered.

1266
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:13,060
And then out of that springs,
these primary phenomenon,

1267
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,790
that's father,
mother child,

1268
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,420
roughly speaking,
and those correspond to nature,

1269
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,970
roughly speaking,
culture,

1270
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,043
roughly speaking,
and the thing that mediates between the 

1271
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:28,940
two of them.
And that's the hero.

1272
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,700
Now it's not just the hero because it's 
also the adversary,

1273
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:35,480
because the adversary is the thing that 
refuses to mediate between those two.

1274
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:40,310
And that's just as much part of the 
individual as the part that will do it.

1275
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,810
Those are logged in internal combat,
so to speak now.

1276
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,683
But that's the first differentiation.
And I think the reason for that is that 

1277
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,363
that is how we differentiate the world 
as we sprayed into consciousness and 

1278
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,930
existence.
It's like,

1279
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,700
first of all,
it's a cake.

1280
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,370
It's chaos.
It's like formless Keto Os.

1281
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,160
That's where you've come from,
whatever that means.

1282
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:03,740
And then post you've got a mother,
that's for sure.

1283
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:06,760
That's a primary reality.
And you have a father and you know,

1284
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:11,120
even if you don't have a father there 
because you're a human being,

1285
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:11,954
you have a father because the father is 
the patriarchal structure or the 

1286
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,170
framing.
You know,

1287
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,210
it's the,
it's the inculturation.

1288
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,493
It's the embodiment of enculturation and
that's going to be in you as you get 

1289
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,100
inculturated,
but it's distributed everywhere in every

1290
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:25,934
one.
Those are the rules by which people 

1291
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:29,580
live.
Not even just the rules,

1292
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,473
click the behavioral rituals,
but govern our interactions and if you 

1293
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,374
don't incorporate,
if you don't become enculturated by the 

1294
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,900
time you,
for your you're,

1295
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:43,650
you're either new astrophe or you're 
antisocial and criminal.

1296
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:45,443
That's the basic rule.
And we know the literature on anti 

1297
01:11:47,651 --> 01:11:48,484
social behavior.
It's like basically what happens is 

1298
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:50,934
there's about 10 percent,
five to 10 percent of boys who are very 

1299
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:58,290
aggressive and assertive and selfish,
roughly speaking,

1300
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,990
self oriented when they're two and you 
can find them,

1301
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:04,020
you just put them together with other 
two year olds and there's this subset of

1302
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:05,250
them.
They're almost always boys,

1303
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:07,260
but not always who bite,
kick,

1304
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,240
kick,
hit and steel.

1305
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,470
And they just do that.

1306
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,260
And the reason is they're like top 
little monsters and you know,

1307
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:14,094
they're out there asserting themselves.
It's just the tail end of a continuum 

1308
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,860
and it's mostly agreeableness.
They're disagreeable kids,

1309
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,780
their toughest boots,
you know,

1310
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,960
and they'll basically stand up to you 
and they're not that easy to scare,

1311
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:26,670
especially if they're low in 
neuroticism.

1312
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:30,540
And so with them it's like,
why the hell should I listen to you?

1313
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:34,510
And my son was like that and he was like
that when he was nine months old,

1314
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:36,900
I,
he'd stare me down like so impressive.

1315
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:41,460
It's really soft and it's like what 
makes it so,

1316
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,750
so,
so,

1317
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,320
so anyways,
it's either with the,

1318
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,880
with the kids that are like that.
If you don't socialize them by the time,

1319
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,723
therefore they,
they then they can't make friends 

1320
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:56,760
because they don't know how to play and 
share and all those things.

1321
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,040
And then they ended up outcasts and you 
know,

1322
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,700
puberty hits,
the testosterone rises and Poof,

1323
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:04,800
they're in jail,
you know,

1324
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:08,970
and whatever you go on to be 
inculturated.

1325
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,200
And that's the incorporation of great 
father and some of that's,

1326
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,123
that's the Super Ego from the audience 
perspective to some of that is positive 

1327
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:19,410
because you bloody well better know how 
to share play games.

1328
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,453
And some of it's negative because one of
the things that's so weird about having 

1329
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:24,234
little kids is that you know,
what you give them hell mostly for is 

1330
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:29,910
having fun.
It's horrible,

1331
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:30,803
you know,
because you think you're always 

1332
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:33,600
punishing kids if we do for breaking 
rules.

1333
01:13:33,601 --> 01:13:35,040
And so on snow,
that's what you do.

1334
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,620
It's like they're running around 
screaming at the top with their guns.

1335
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,110
They're completely having a blast,
you know,

1336
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,480
and they're destroying the house in the 
process,

1337
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,310
but they're really having fun and you 
know,

1338
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,860
you're,
you guys settled out right now.

1339
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,470
It's like you're doing that all the 
time.

1340
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,990
So not only do you bring the negative 
emotion,

1341
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:53,400
you know,
the tiers and the pavement,

1342
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:57,090
the frustration and the anger and the 
hostility under control.

1343
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:57,953
So they stopped having temper tantrums 
and they don't hit you when they're mad 

1344
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:03,180
or themselves.
But get that all under control.

1345
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:04,343
Jesus regulate the positive promotion.
It just dampened it right down until 

1346
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,920
they can go sit with their 80 year old 
grandmother quietly,

1347
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,500
you know.
So it's a real restricting process.

1348
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:17,620
And that's why half of the Greek father 
is a tyrant.

1349
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,570
There's no way out of that,
you know,

1350
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:20,404
like you hope that the whole damn thing 
isn't a tyrant because obviously by 

1351
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:25,174
socializing your children,
you're doing them a great favor right 

1352
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:28,240
here.
First of all,

1353
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:30,400
they learned how to talk.
That's very useful.

1354
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:33,340
They learn how to read,
they learn how to play with other kids,

1355
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:34,174
so at the same time that you're 
constraining the hallow them and making 

1356
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:38,374
them less than they were in some ways,
you're also opening up vistas to them 

1357
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,290
that they would otherwise not have 
access to.

1358
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,813
You know,
in one of the things that's very bunch 

1359
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:51,550
we're thinking about is that you 
basically die into your personality.

1360
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,560
You know,
so what happens?

1361
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:55,690
It's a Darwinian issue.
Fundamentally.

1362
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,340
What are your first board of your 
neurons?

1363
01:14:57,341 --> 01:14:58,174
Have more connections than you can shake
a stick at like more than you'll ever 

1364
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:01,474
have in your entire life.
And then all the ones you don't use dye 

1365
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,943
and so what that is,
it's a collapse of potential into 

1366
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:11,440
actuality.
But let's make no mistake about it.

1367
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:12,274
It's costly because you become what you 
are instead of all the things that you 

1368
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,980
could have been and people experienced 
that as a cost.

1369
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:18,843
That's the story of Peter Pan.
I don't want to grow up because I don't 

1370
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:25,000
want to become one thing instead of the 
many things I could be.

1371
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,043
Now,
the problem with that theory is you get 

1372
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,114
a whole right,
so you don't sustain your potential 

1373
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,673
without.

1374
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:39,010
Even if you don't develop it,
it doesn't just sit around and go stale.

1375
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:42,880
Curdles get salary,
so it's not an.

1376
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,940
It's not an acceptable choice that 
people make that choice all the time,

1377
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,840
especially if they take the great father
isn't anything but captain right?

1378
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,953
A terrible heidrick tyrant who's 
terrified of death crocodile with the 

1379
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:57,424
clock in its stomach.
It's already got a piece of him and 

1380
01:15:58,711 --> 01:16:00,730
that's the great.
That's the dragon of chaos.

1381
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,980
He's being chased by the dragon of 
chaos.

1382
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:04,123
Like if you were terrified of the dragon
of chaos and you're in the patriarchal 

1383
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:09,154
role and there'd be a tyrant and then 
why the hell would anyone grow up to be 

1384
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:13,294
want to be like you?
One of the things I see in my clients 

1385
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:16,360
very,
very often,

1386
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,180
and this is more characteristic of the 
males and the females,

1387
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:22,773
is that many of them will not allow the 
cells to experience anger or aggression 

1388
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,690
or to express it because they have 
tyrannical fathers,

1389
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,903
you know,
and so one of the things they decided 

1390
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,080
when they were like four was,
I've never going to be like that.

1391
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,221
It's like,
well,

1392
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,054
that doesn't work out because you know 
you need the capacity for anger and 

1393
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:43,804
hostility and aggression and all that.
You have to have that at hand and you 

1394
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:49,630
don't fix it.
By refusing to manifest.

1395
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,823
All that does is cripple you because 
you're missing half of your emotional 

1396
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,290
dynamism and a whole chunk of your 
power.

1397
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,170
Know we don't have that many sources of 
power.

1398
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,450
You've got enthusiasm.
The answer,

1399
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,280
good one,
curiosity,

1400
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:05,680
interest,
appreciation for beauty.

1401
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,350
You know,
anger is unbelievably useful,

1402
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,000
tremendous reservoir of power.
You know,

1403
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:12,843
and you don't want to suppress that.
You want to harness it so it's at hand 

1404
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,570
so that people don't mess with you 
because they will.

1405
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,773
People will push,
especially pushing people and if you 

1406
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:25,850
can,
well if you can't push back,

1407
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:29,000
you're going to walk all over you.
They won't even notice,

1408
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:30,980
you know,
because you'll just move and they'll,

1409
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,360
they won't even notice that they pushed 
you over so when you will go home,

1410
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,213
you'll be all resentful and irritated 
who brewed on it for a month and it's 

1411
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,350
like they didn't even have to say 
anything at so.

1412
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,733
And you know,
so the man I've seen often will refuse 

1413
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:49,520
themselves access to,
to anger in particular.

1414
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,003
And then with women it's often the case 
that they have a harder time getting 

1415
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:56,760
access to it because women are more 
agreeable than men.

1416
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:00,010
So it's harder for women to be,
you know,

1417
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,980
it's hard for a woman even if she's 
pretty damn tough to really contend with

1418
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:07,730
the guidance.
Really difficult as guys who were really

1419
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:08,564
disagreeable,
especially if they're physically 

1420
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:13,190
intimidating and super smart and those 
people are very,

1421
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:15,010
very difficult to deal with it,
you know,

1422
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:18,140
because the cut you into pieces verbally
and they won't budge.

1423
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,243
And so you have to really ratchet up 
your preparation before you can 

1424
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,540
withstand that.
And you know,

1425
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,383
a lot of women here who are going to be 
dealing with in corporate environments 

1426
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:31,280
and dealing with people who are tough to
go in and get prepared for that.

1427
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,340
And it's no joke.
There's some very,

1428
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:37,720
very,
very broad card people up there.

1429
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,810
And that's a good thing.
There's nothing would happen without,

1430
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:43,880
you know,
there are forced to contend with.

1431
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,000
So anyways,
the dragon of chaos,

1432
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:49,220
roughly speaking,
differentiates itself.

1433
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:53,030
And did these fundamental,
you could say personified elegance,

1434
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,940
but for Sondra fight is the wrong idea 
because you know,

1435
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,280
usually when you think of something as 
being personified,

1436
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,133
do you think of it as being something 
and then you act as if it's taken on 

1437
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:03,960
persona.
Find Quality,

1438
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,930
you know,
so it's like a projection now.

1439
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:10,400
I don't think that's how it works.
I think that we naturally experience the

1440
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:11,234
world in the persona fight categories 
and then we have to take them apart to 

1441
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:15,710
get the world,
you know,

1442
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,540
look again at that differentiated world 
out them.

1443
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,540
So for example,
when you're a baby,

1444
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,570
roughly speaking the world is your 
mother,

1445
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,633
and then as you differentiate the world,
it starts to turn into things that 

1446
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:29,954
aren't your mother,
but it isn't like you confuse the world 

1447
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:33,560
with your mother to begin with.

1448
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,403
It's modern world to begin with.
And it's a perfectly reasonable way of 

1449
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:38,840
thinking about it.
I mean,

1450
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,560
you're only this faith.
Your mother's really big and she's taken

1451
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:45,550
3 billion years to build.
So you know,

1452
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,780
that's a force of nature to contend 
with.

1453
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:48,614
And by thinking,
by conceptualizing that entity as the 

1454
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:55,490
world,
you've done a pretty good job of initial

1455
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:56,324
modeling because think about this.
You're actually a reflection of the 

1456
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:01,520
world,
right?

1457
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,473
You really are,
because you were shaped by the world in 

1458
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,720
your evolutionary development.
It's like,

1459
01:20:05,721 --> 01:20:08,850
here's the world hears you.
You're like,

1460
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,050
you're a little reflection of the world 
because the world has made you.

1461
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,303
And so you embody it.
The world is the sort of place where 

1462
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:21,300
something like you can adjust to it.
That means you're a lot like the world.

1463
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,373
And so if you start out with the 
assumption that the world is a lot like 

1464
01:20:24,661 --> 01:20:27,870
your mother is actually a pretty good 
assumption,

1465
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:32,300
it is pretty much like your mother and 
she is a force of nature and so it's not

1466
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,550
personification is first pass,
understand,

1467
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:36,953
and then you know,
the father comes into it in one form or 

1468
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:40,110
another,
you know,

1469
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,900
in a fractured for perhaps or a complete
form,

1470
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,790
you know,
with the hope that you have a parent.

1471
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:45,623
Do you have,
you hope you have an architectural 

1472
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,213
parents,
some sense who embodies that entire 

1473
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:50,754
dynamic range of what it means to have 
that gender because then they're a 

1474
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:57,240
really good representative of the world.
Also,

1475
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,850
most of the world that you're going to 
interact with isn't stuff.

1476
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,773
It's people.
So in so far as your mother and your 

1477
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:07,584
father or the world,
that's a really good model because 

1478
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:13,830
everyone you meet is going to be your 
mother or your father roughly speaking.

1479
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:15,443
So you know,
if they're very dynamic people and they 

1480
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:21,000
embodied the full range of human 
possibility,

1481
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,980
you know,
in so far as one person can do that,

1482
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,053
then they're excellent models.
For what you're going to be interacting 

1483
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,320
with for the rest of your life and that 
is what they should be,

1484
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,693
right?
Because on average what you should do 

1485
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:32,004
for your children is be as much like the
world is you can be because that would 

1486
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:37,314
prepare them for the work so you 
shouldn't be too nice because the world 

1487
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:40,674
isn't too nice and you shouldn't be too 
harsh because then you'll just crush 

1488
01:21:43,891 --> 01:21:44,724
them,
but you shouldn't be like making things 

1489
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,180
easy for them.

1490
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,160
You know,
when you should be making things.

1491
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:54,150
It's difficult for them as they can 
possibly manage and it takes a real.

1492
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,103
You really have to have a relationship 
with a child will be able to do that 

1493
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:57,684
because you got to keep them in the zone
of proximal development and that to do 

1494
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:03,200
that you have to know what their life,
you know,

1495
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,910
and so if they can carry five following 
Monday,

1496
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,860
he put another ounce on Tuesday and you 
know,

1497
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,870
that way they,
you,

1498
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,680
you a lot.
It's the anti eatable approach.

1499
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,514
You,
you encourage them to become strong and 

1500
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:18,630
independent.
Very hard on parents to do that.

1501
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:19,464
Especially if they define their lives by
their children because they will want 

1502
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:24,474
the child to leave.
That's not a good thing because you 

1503
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:31,510
don't end up with the child.
You ended up with a crippled monster and

1504
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:33,330
you know,
in the closet,

1505
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,980
you know,
not good.

1506
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,170
So.
Okay.

1507
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:38,220
So anyways,
you know,

1508
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,930
and the child obviously is there too.
There's the mother of the father and the

1509
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,640
child whole situation,
that's the world.

1510
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:45,673
And so that's what things break into the
first and I think our social cognitive 

1511
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:49,883
primate brain operates that way and then
if it operates that way and there seems 

1512
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:55,344
to be plenty of evidence that it does.
And then the next thing you might think 

1513
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:58,820
as well,
maybe that is the right thing.

1514
01:22:58,821 --> 01:23:02,850
So since our brain evolved and mirrors 
reality,

1515
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,013
that's perfectly reasonable way of 
thinking about reality from Egypt on 

1516
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,070
great.
And from China on the left,

1517
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:18,310
that's actually on the left.
That's actually Osiris and isis,

1518
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,320
if I remember correct.
So that's so cool.

1519
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,154
You know,
they emerge from the primordial serpent 

1520
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,490
out of chaos.
The predatory,

1521
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,520
dangerous and promising chaos emerges.
The primary archetypal things.

1522
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,593
Yeah.

1523
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:38,363
No I don't.
And I can't give you much more 

1524
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:42,634
information about that,
although because a couple of students 

1525
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,790
sent it to me over different spans of 
time.

1526
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,490
So.
But I don't have the story at hand,

1527
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:53,910
unfortunately.
I love this.

1528
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:54,783
Okay.
It's now we're going to concentrate on 

1529
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:57,340
the fifth on the archetypes of the 
feminine.

1530
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,680
So this is femininity,
right?

1531
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:04,450
This isn't a female a woman.
It's a class,

1532
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:06,520
it's a category.
It's an architectural category.

1533
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,473
So we're investigating the nature of the
feminine and the use of the feminine as 

1534
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:14,770
a mode of representing things.
Okay.

1535
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:15,604
So this is a nice cap.
It's like done by know drug addled 

1536
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:24,370
hippies in the 19 sixties.
I think they lived in San Francisco.

1537
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:27,640
Actually think they knew Robert crumb 
because he was a.

1538
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:28,683
He was an underground cartoonist and 
fact I think crumb probably established 

1539
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:37,720
a little organization that gave this guy
who's named Ms Dot Gilbert Shelton.

1540
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,553
His start in his career.
So he has these characters that are 

1541
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:41,764
three hippies and they're always 
experimenting with drugs in one form or 

1542
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:45,850
another.
And they have this cat,

1543
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,713
it's fat freddy's Cap.
And they kind of liked the cat and the 

1544
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:51,520
cap has its own adventures and this is 
one of them.

1545
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,383
So the hippies had just sold a bunch of 
cocaine and they bought this little 

1546
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:55,864
estate in the country and so they're 
bringing their cattle there and it's 

1547
01:24:58,181 --> 01:25:00,580
never been in the country.
And it's pretty interesting.

1548
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:01,414
I think it's a funny cartoon because 
I've had cats and they hate it when you 

1549
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:04,700
move places,
you know,

1550
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,250
because they're all comfortable where 
they were.

1551
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:08,500
And then you move to captain the new 
place and it's like,

1552
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,930
it's like the little rap that you just 
put in the new cage,

1553
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,973
that cat is not happy.
Maybe it will just sit there and cry 

1554
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:15,590
because they will do that,
you know?

1555
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,713
But then they sort of loosen up and 
eventually they sort of master the new 

1556
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:21,250
territory and it's very stressful for a 
cap.

1557
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,830
So dogs are much better at doing that 
from,

1558
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:26,950
for whatever reason.
Maybe it's because they're pack animals.

1559
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,540
Okay.
Anyways,

1560
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,140
the hippie takes the cat out,
shows them the country.

1561
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,370
It'd be the cat's not that happy about 
that.

1562
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,273
So it goes into this crouch which 
animals actually do when they explored 

1563
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:38,523
new territory.
So if you put a rat in a cage and it 

1564
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:43,200
starts to move around it hunches down,
you know,

1565
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,600
sort of slinking through the undergrowth
basically so that nothing can see it.

1566
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:50,080
So that's what cap will do.
And then the cat sniffs away,

1567
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:52,630
which is what a capital do because 
they're mostly old factory,

1568
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:53,523
like most animals.
And then poof it encounters an anomaly 

1569
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,693
and that's already on edge.
So like an explorer exploring cat like 

1570
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:01,144
this would have,
it's for half popped up already because 

1571
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,823
it's funny.

1572
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:07,010
It's preparing for what's lurking out 
there in the unknown.

1573
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,010
And then if anything just triggers it 
over the edge.

1574
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:12,100
You've seen this,
if you've ever gone behind the cap,

1575
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,890
like wit to it,
if it's,

1576
01:26:13,891 --> 01:26:14,724
especially if it's someone startled 
thing will just explode into for the 

1577
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,680
jump four feet in the air and then it's 
very amusing,

1578
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,573
you know,
so a little better off than the other 

1579
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:25,550
direction.
Take revenge on later.

1580
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:27,663
So anyway,
is the cat encountered something that 

1581
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,500
doesn't understand and then runs up to 
the adults.

1582
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:35,163
And so the MP say the cap disappeared to
now and he says under the house and the 

1583
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:39,164
cat says Ukiah too,
if you'd smell what I did and then it 

1584
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:43,694
shows what it smells and it's a great 
thing and it's like it's got duck feet 

1585
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:47,294
and it's got a like deer antlers and 
it's got a whole face and it's got a 

1586
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:56,270
skunk tail and it's like you might say,
well that thing doesn't exist,

1587
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:59,060
but then you might say,
wait a minute.

1588
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:03,170
If you're going to derive a first pass 
approximation of what the what's lurking

1589
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:06,830
out there in the forest,
that's not a bad representation.

1590
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:07,813
It's like it's alive.
It's got the properties of the skunk 

1591
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:14,240
going to and a wolf and all these things
in Melbourne made it into one thing.

1592
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,970
Now it actually is what's waiting out 
there in the bush.

1593
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,373
Now as you exploring,
you're going to differentiate that into 

1594
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:23,930
sub categories,
but you don't.

1595
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,440
You can't start your knowledge at a high
level of resolution.

1596
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:29,660
You're going to start at a low level of 
resolution.

1597
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:34,640
You've got to come up with a low level 
resolution model that's accurate but not

1598
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:35,474
detailed.
And the reason you have to do that is 

1599
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:39,890
because you bloody well better do it 
fast because if you don't,

1600
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:41,240
you're going to be sitting around and 
thinking,

1601
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:42,400
well,
are you a deer,

1602
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,970
a wolf or a Fox?

1603
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,120
And the next answer to that is,
I'm the thing that eight,

1604
01:27:47,121 --> 01:27:49,580
you know,
so it's not a good,

1605
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,800
it's not a good approach.
You want to get quick and dirty.

1606
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:55,220
And that's why kids,
I think that's why kids imagine monsters

1607
01:27:55,221 --> 01:27:59,210
all the time in the dark.
It's like there aren't monsters,

1608
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:03,470
well not in that particular gardens,
but the kid is not that stupid.

1609
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:04,963
It's wired up,
knows what's out there in the dark and 

1610
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,280
it's not good.
And so it takes a lot of calming to make

1611
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:12,230
a chart,
especially because we have kids sleep in

1612
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:14,840
your own bedroom.
Like that's not natural for kids.

1613
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,640
I know what I'm saying.
That is what should happen.

1614
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,013
But as an evolutionary know,
I think it does encourage you to 

1615
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:24,800
dependents and all that.
He at the cost of some trauma.

1616
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,113
But you know,
you can perfectly well imagine that 

1617
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,390
collective humans,
150,000

1618
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:37,391
years ago stayed in a pretty type heat 
when they were sleeping because that's a

1619
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:39,950
lot safer,
especially if they're,

1620
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,070
if you're little and delicious and 
edible.

1621
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,573
So.
So I love the cartoon because it's also 

1622
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:49,400
a really useful illustration about how 
fantasy,

1623
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,460
you know,
how a fantasy operates automatically and

1624
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:56,270
regenerate these generic low resolution 
categories.

1625
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:58,710
All right,
so now here is,

1626
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,010
this is Kelly.
She's a Hindu goddess.

1627
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:06,320
And so you might say,
well,

1628
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:07,494
did people invent gods?
I think that's a very weird question 

1629
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,273
because the answer is yes.
And NASA results will know because you 

1630
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:16,980
could also just as easily say that God's
people.

1631
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:21,030
It depends on how you look at anyways,
you know,

1632
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:25,050
if you think about it from a Marxist 
perspective or Friday and perspective or

1633
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,093
from a scientific perspective and those 
perspective that tend to be very 

1634
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:31,950
destructive to religious thinking.
You're basically,

1635
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:32,970
you've got to think,
okay,

1636
01:29:32,971 --> 01:29:36,690
well the image is there to,
to protect you against death,

1637
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:39,810
anxiety or,
and that it's a substitute father.

1638
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:41,460
That's the Freud defined again,
basically,

1639
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:44,610
or that their religion was constructed 
to aid in abet.

1640
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,593
Those are in those who are empowered to 
keep all the peasants and the Lo life's 

1641
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:49,830
under control by,
you know,

1642
01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:50,664
like promising them happy ever after if 
they behave or that it's just a 

1643
01:29:54,631 --> 01:29:55,464
primitive scientific theory that should 
be superseded now that we have more 

1644
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,870
knowledge.
Those are the alternative hypotheses.

1645
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,630
Okay,
well let's look at this image.

1646
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,973
So this is Kelly and she's a destroyer.
Devour that doesn't mean she's bad by 

1647
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:12,740
the way.
It means something to contend with.

1648
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,930
She's like the tmf.
So I couldn't take her apart so that you

1649
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:16,764
can see her because you can't,
unless you happen to know what this 

1650
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:23,700
means because of your culture and even 
then you might not be able to see it.

1651
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,480
So let's figure it out.
Now she has eight ladies.

1652
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:31,070
Why?
What has eight legs expire?

1653
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,350
How do you all feel about spiders?
Right?

1654
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:35,363
And the reason you feel like that is 
because you have these little spider 

1655
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:38,550
detectors on your skin.

1656
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,413
Those are basically cares.
And when the spider crawls along in the 

1657
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:43,404
spider detectors,
you get this creepy feeling and that's 

1658
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:48,720
you basically shaking your skin to get 
rid of the damn spider course.

1659
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:50,640
You can't do that anymore because you're
not a horse,

1660
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:51,843
you know,
so you just kind of have this digital 

1661
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:56,280
feeling like that.
And spider can give you a good chomping,

1662
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,533
you know?
And so sometimes that's actually 

1663
01:30:58,771 --> 01:30:59,604
poisonous and that's not so good.
But also a spiker is an interesting 

1664
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:03,894
thing from a conceptual perspective 
because it spins a web and the web 

1665
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:09,840
catches things that aren't paying 
attention.

1666
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,453
And then the thing that isn't paying 
attention gets wrapped up in this 

1667
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:15,900
spider's Web and then it gets sucked 
dry.

1668
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,660
So that's a spider.
Okay.

1669
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:21,930
So she's a spider now.
Spiders are pretty cool too because they

1670
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:23,070
can spin webs,
you know.

1671
01:31:23,071 --> 01:31:24,750
And that's the web of faith by the way.

1672
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:27,000
That's the way with faith.
Um,

1673
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,370
so that's one thing.
She's a,

1674
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,940
she's a spider and then,
well she's in this web,

1675
01:31:32,941 --> 01:31:35,340
but the web has made other fire that's 
fire.

1676
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:37,560
And then inside the fire,
those are skulls.

1677
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:41,160
So she's a spider that sits in a web of 
fire and skulls,

1678
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,860
so believe me,
if you saw a spider like that,

1679
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,073
you'd be looking at it.
You might screen first and maybe he 

1680
01:31:47,871 --> 01:31:49,850
would run away,
but then you'd come back and look at it.

1681
01:31:49,851 --> 01:31:50,590
It's like,
oh look,

1682
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,730
I found a spider,
a web of fire itself.

1683
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:54,660
I'm happy,
very attractive to you.

1684
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:56,460
You probably wouldn't be able to forget 
about it.

1685
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,440
And you know,
that's one thing about Kelly.

1686
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:02,470
She's the bunch of things that you 
bloody well cannot forget about.

1687
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,880
And so you could actually even say she's
a model of all those things that you can

1688
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:07,714
forget about.

1689
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:09,550
And then you could say,
well,

1690
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,120
she's an attempt tomorrow.
All those things you can't forget about.

1691
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,853
And you might say,
well why would you want to model those 

1692
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:18,640
things?
Well it's because you bloody well better

1693
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:20,890
remember those things or you're not 
going to stay alive.

1694
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,910
And then you might ask,
what should you be dealing with?

1695
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:29,911
The things that you shouldn't forget 
about one by one fires say or,

1696
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,020
or,
or skeletons.

1697
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,213
Should you be dealing with that one on 
one or spiders or snakes or should you 

1698
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:39,670
be dealing with that as a category?
Right?

1699
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,533
That's the thing about human beings is 
we like to deal with things as 

1700
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,224
categories because that way you could 
solve a whole bunch of problems at the 

1701
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,190
same time.
You know,

1702
01:32:48,191 --> 01:32:50,080
so you might say you do this all the 
time.

1703
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,663
You don't.
If you go on log on online and you look 

1704
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:58,060
at people who are having one advice 
about relationships,

1705
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:01,240
they want advice about relationships and
you think,

1706
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:06,241
well really what they want is to figure 
out how to deal with this female or this

1707
01:33:08,741 --> 01:33:11,680
mail,
but they don't ask that question.

1708
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:14,650
They ask,
how can I improve my relationships?

1709
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:15,603
Which is that they're trying to solve 
the problem of how to relate to all the 

1710
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,343
set of all potential relationships right
now because maybe that's better 

1711
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:23,884
information than exactly what to do 
about this particular male or female at 

1712
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,530
this particular point in time.
Now,

1713
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:30,364
often it isn't,
but you can understand why people push 

1714
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:33,521
for that.
It's like,

1715
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:36,010
why not get the general answer?
If you can,

1716
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:38,170
then you solve the whole class of 
problems.

1717
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,960
Okay,
so what's the class of problems here?

1718
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:45,460
The class of problems here is the class 
of problems.

1719
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:48,730
It's how do you conceptualize the class 
of problems?

1720
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:51,520
It's a brilliant.
That's such a brilliant question.

1721
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:52,880
You know,
for,

1722
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:54,520
for.
I mean maybe you can't.

1723
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:55,653
Maybe there's no commonality between all
of those things that constitute a 

1724
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,850
problem,
but by the same token,

1725
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:01,684
maybe there is.

1726
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,850
Well this is an attempt to do that.
Okay.

1727
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:08,110
So what else about the Kelly?
She's got a sword for hair's on fire.

1728
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:13,210
She also has a headband of skulls now 
people don't like smells very much,

1729
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:14,044
you know,
they creep us out and there's good 

1730
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,010
reason for that because all things 
considered,

1731
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:18,844
you should probably avoid places where 
there are a lot of sculpture because 

1732
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:22,804
it's easy to infer from that that a lot 
of people like you died there and that 

1733
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:27,334
might be because there's something 
around that it's going to kill you just 

1734
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:32,230
like it killed all those other things or
there's some illness or whatever.

1735
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:37,231
It's like get the hell out of there.
So even chimps don't like chip hands and

1736
01:34:37,901 --> 01:34:40,150
they don't like it.
Mobile chip bodies.

1737
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:41,283
So you know,
a scuffle for us it's like well you can 

1738
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:45,610
see it's death itself,
you know,

1739
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:46,444
and it is that,
but it's an architect will assemble and 

1740
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,510
you don't get accustomed to skull very,
very hard.

1741
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:53,823
So just got skulls everywhere.
Well sometimes she has tons of a tire 

1742
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,280
but she doesn't think this particular 
representation.

1743
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,770
But sometimes she does.
And that's the predatory element.

1744
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:05,900
And the tiger,
that's a pretty fascinating thing,

1745
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:07,870
right?
Because it's like 12 feet long,

1746
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,803
five feet high and you know,
it's a major piece of engineering back 

1747
01:35:12,981 --> 01:35:17,870
and probably it will eat you.
So to put the timer is counting on.

1748
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:22,280
County also indicates that she's 
representative of those terrible awe,

1749
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:25,970
inspiring predatory things that lurk in 
the forest.

1750
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:28,040
Of course this is an Indian 
representation.

1751
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:33,020
She often has this snake around her 
waist and usually it's a Cobra Cobra.

1752
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:33,854
Is there another thing that people find 
absolutely fascinating like fire and 

1753
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:38,240
then.
But not in this situation,

1754
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:41,180
what she has wrapped around her instead 
of her intestines.

1755
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,733
And you see how our bellies hall,
she just gave birth to that unfortunate 

1756
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:47,804
character that she happened to be 
standing on and his intestines that 

1757
01:35:50,631 --> 01:35:54,020
she's eating right now.

1758
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:57,770
I fail to see how this symbol can 
protect you from death anxiety,

1759
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,800
you know,
quite the contrary.

1760
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:03,910
It seems to me to be something that 
would seriously evoke it,

1761
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:05,043
you know,
and there's no patriarchal protection 

1762
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:11,090
here and I can't see how anybody could 
use this to oppress the peasants.

1763
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:12,950
You know,
maybe they could scare them with it,

1764
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,530
but that isn't actually how Kelly is 
used.

1765
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,470
So I don't think that that's a useful 
way of thinking about it at all.

1766
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,270
Now,
interestingly enough,

1767
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,430
Kelly is something you made sacrifices 
to now that's cool.

1768
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:27,740
And because it's weird,
people have had a hard time to figure it

1769
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,810
out.
The whole idea of sacrifice.

1770
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:30,644
So there was this guy who was a 
journalist in the 19 sixties and he 

1771
01:36:34,191 --> 01:36:35,990
wrote a book,
his name was Arthur Kessler.

1772
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:37,820
He wrote a book called the ghost in the 
machine,

1773
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:39,260
which is a book of consciousness.

1774
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:44,210
And one of the things he pointed out was
that the Motif of sacrifice seemed to be

1775
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,130
architectural,
it was universal,

1776
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,473
it was happening everywhere.
And one of the side effects of that was 

1777
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:52,040
human sacrifice.
Go onto row,

1778
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:52,883
upset you can sacrifice a couple of 
slaves or captures or children because 

1779
01:36:57,201 --> 01:36:59,420
the Carthaginians used to do that all 
the time,

1780
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:00,343
their own children.
And they have them smile before they 

1781
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:05,620
killed them.
So it was brutal room.

1782
01:37:05,621 --> 01:37:06,454
But the Carthaginians they would commit 
suicide at the drop of a hat because 

1783
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:12,650
their basic idea was if you screwed up 
while you're wrong,

1784
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,590
time to kill yourself,
there's no hope for you.

1785
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,083
So it's very common idea.
And the Japanese still practiced that 

1786
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:22,690
before World War Two as well.
It's like,

1787
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,180
so.
So anyways,

1788
01:37:24,181 --> 01:37:26,900
so the whole idea of sacrifice pretty 
damn dark,

1789
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:27,920
you know,
and,

1790
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,910
and Kessler regarded it as evidence that
the human race was basically insane,

1791
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:37,190
like fundamental,
biological manner that was not fixable.

1792
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:40,040
So it was like the ultimate in original 
sin and the theorizing,

1793
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:41,570
you know,
when that was written,

1794
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:42,404
when everybody was all shorted out about
the fact that we are going to blow 

1795
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:45,224
ourselves up with nuclear weapons.
And so the idea that humans were 

1796
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:51,410
basically insane,
which is not a bad theory,

1797
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:52,920
you know,
you could even say we're,

1798
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:56,520
we've been driven insane by the nature 
of being anyways.

1799
01:37:57,470 --> 01:38:02,220
You make sacrifices to kill it.
They're often blood sacrifices.

1800
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,743
Now that's kind of interesting because 
one of the things that you might notice 

1801
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,830
about what Kelly represent,
which you might say is the predatory,

1802
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,310
like almost diabolical site of nature.
You know,

1803
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:18,630
the part of nature that's really working
hard at doing un is that it does seem to

1804
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:19,464
thrive on blood.
And so there's an idea here which is if 

1805
01:38:22,711 --> 01:38:25,980
you give the damn thing what it wants,
maybe it will leave you alone.

1806
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,310
But there's more sophisticated idea 
right beneath that.

1807
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:30,144
Because what happens if you sacrifice to
Kelly because she turns into her office 

1808
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:35,490
and her opposite is,
well,

1809
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:37,830
it's the opposite of this.
It's benevolent nature.

1810
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,460
It's the kind of nature that that 
environmentalists believe it,

1811
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,933
you know,
it's like nature as French 

1812
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,004
impressionists landscape.
It's not mosquito mosquitoes and Guinea 

1813
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:52,570
worms and cancer and crocodiles and 
gangrene.

1814
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:53,670
It's,
you know,

1815
01:38:53,671 --> 01:38:54,504
it's,
it's a sunny day in that old growth 

1816
01:38:57,541 --> 01:39:00,510
forest where you know,
Disney dear,

1817
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:02,910
constantly around smiling at you.
You know,

1818
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:07,170
and that's nature too because nature is 
what gibbs and if you use the feminine,

1819
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,033
the feminine symbolism,
I mean your mother is certainly someone 

1820
01:39:10,921 --> 01:39:14,310
who can be an absolutely horrific forest
and that often happens to infants,

1821
01:39:14,311 --> 01:39:16,070
but by the same token,
chief,

1822
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,600
the bearer of everything that pulls you 
into life,

1823
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:20,003
you know,
and her,

1824
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,490
her contact with you or her physical 
contact or ability to play with you.

1825
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:24,323
The fact that she looks at you,
the fact that she feeds you directly 

1826
01:39:26,551 --> 01:39:27,384
from her body.
It's like that's the whole opposite of 

1827
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,410
Kali,
the destroyer,

1828
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,450
and they're both elements of the 
feminine.

1829
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,003
And part of the reason I think that it's
the feminine per se that came to 

1830
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,473
represent the destructive element of 
nature as well as the positive element 

1831
01:39:41,941 --> 01:39:45,450
is that men experience women in many 
ways.

1832
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:47,580
As the disruptive element of the 
feminine,

1833
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:48,773
because men are always been rejected by 
women and women are nature because 

1834
01:39:52,381 --> 01:39:57,381
nature is what selects you to reproduce,
and so the answer for most women to most

1835
01:39:57,451 --> 01:39:58,284
men is you're a nice enough guy,
but there's no way your genes should 

1836
01:40:01,411 --> 01:40:03,950
propagate themselves into the future,
you know,

1837
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,080
and that's as harsh a judgment as could 
possibly be rendered.

1838
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,060
If you watch chrome,
for example,

1839
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:10,223
which I recommend it because it's full 
of great mother's symbolism is he's 

1840
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,920
being described himself as someone who 
is so much of a loser.

1841
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,110
He's not even in the dominance 
hierarchy,

1842
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,120
you know,
he's not at the bottom,

1843
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,190
he's outside,
you know,

1844
01:40:23,191 --> 01:40:26,160
so he described himself as someone for 
it was,

1845
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:30,840
especially him and his older brother,
it was virtually impossible for there to

1846
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:35,870
even conceive of the idea that they 
might ask a girl in high school.

1847
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,793
It wasn't that they would get refused.
It was that it was inconceivable that 

1848
01:40:40,621 --> 01:40:41,454
they could even do it.
That's where they were in the dominance 

1849
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:43,734
arc.
So of course from and who has a mother 

1850
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:47,220
to go with it,
you know,

1851
01:40:47,221 --> 01:40:48,054
all his females are like these extremely
physically powerful bird headed 

1852
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,250
goddesses,
more or less,

1853
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,084
and he construed themselves with this 
little word thing that's sort of 

1854
01:40:58,121 --> 01:41:02,620
cowering at their feet and it's deeply 
embedded and to wonder,

1855
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,113
given his circumstances,
it's no wonder he actually did a 

1856
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:10,780
remarkable job of,
of developing himself in a,

1857
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,750
in a,
in a productive manner,

1858
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:14,220
I think given what he had to go against.

1859
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:15,370
But anyways,
yeah,

1860
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:16,204
he is.
You sacrificed to Kelby and you bring 

1861
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:22,651
forth its opposite.
Now it's like I was once I thought,

1862
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:23,734
I thought I understood,
I thought that I had come to understand 

1863
01:41:25,811 --> 01:41:26,644
the idea of sacrifice.
I think I figured this out about 15 

1864
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:29,134
years ago and it just blew up.
Blew me over when I figured it out 

1865
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:32,763
because it had always been viewed either
as kind of an empath phenomenon or 

1866
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:38,410
something that's pathological,
but it's not.

1867
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:39,423
It's the most remarkable.
It's one of the most remarkable 

1868
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:43,114
conceptual discoveries that human race 
has ever made because what it meant was 

1869
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:49,360
we started to figure out that if you 
gave something,

1870
01:41:49,361 --> 01:41:50,194
what it wanted,
if you gave something something of 

1871
01:41:52,241 --> 01:41:56,140
value,
then you can turn it into something that

1872
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:59,710
might be beneficial to you.
So it's the,

1873
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,583
it's,
it's the common towns of delayed 

1874
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:08,470
gratification.
Delayed gratification is a sacrifice.

1875
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,540
So you know the,
the,

1876
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,190
the marshmallow experiment,
right?

1877
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:14,560
Okay.
So you get these little kids,

1878
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,740
you're tortured,
you say,

1879
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:16,783
hey,
hey,

1880
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:18,460
you like marshmallows.
It's like,

1881
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:19,294
yeah,
I know you.

1882
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,890
Okay?
So here's the advice of the.

1883
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:26,230
Now if you don't eat those marshmallows,
you get to have more marshmallows.

1884
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,850
And so then you leave.
And some of the kids eat parched,

1885
01:42:29,851 --> 01:42:30,684
Alex,
right?

1886
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,653
And you got to admit those kids.
There's something about them to get the 

1887
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:35,930
damn marshmallows,
you know?

1888
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,470
So if there was an earthquake,
right,

1889
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:40,930
then those kids would have one.
Okay?

1890
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:41,764
So that's something to think about 
because delayed gratification is not 

1891
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:44,614
always the right answer.
The environment has to be stable enough 

1892
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:51,550
so that the probability that you will 
get what you've delayed for is high,

1893
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:55,240
and so if you're living in sheer chaos,
you're a fool to delay gratification.

1894
01:42:55,241 --> 01:42:58,120
It's like eat the damn marshmallow now 
so,

1895
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:02,740
so it's not like delayed gratification 
is the solution for everything.

1896
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:05,470
It's not.
Sometimes it's the solution.

1897
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,723
So what do you do?
You make the sacrifice now and the idea 

1898
01:43:10,571 --> 01:43:11,404
is it will pay off in the future so that
you think about that in architectural 

1899
01:43:13,991 --> 01:43:14,824
forms.
That means that you forego something of 

1900
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:19,284
value.
Now it's a sacrifice you let go of it 

1901
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:22,923
and the deal is if you let go of it,
better things will happen to you in the 

1902
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:31,060
future and you know,
no other animal has figured that out.

1903
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,163
Well,
squirrels maybe because they store 

1904
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:37,330
knocks,
but I don't really believe that they.

1905
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,590
I think it's fundamentally an instinct.
You know what I mean?

1906
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,170
I don't think they generalize from that 
idea.

1907
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:45,004
They do act it out,
but I don't think they generalize from 

1908
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:49,600
it.
They haven't turned it into a concept.

1909
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:50,703
And so the concept here is the world is 
constituted such that it hasn't 

1910
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,243
tremendously destructive element,
but if you can barter with that 

1911
01:43:58,161 --> 01:43:58,994
properly,
then you can flip it over into part of 

1912
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:01,640
it.

1913
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,860
That's positive group will reveal 
itself.

1914
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:07,190
That's bloody brilliant.
It's unbelievably brilliant.

1915
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:12,191
And there's even another element to it 
because let's say that all your,

1916
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,570
all you been getting from reality for 
awhile is Kelly.

1917
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,490
It's all spiders and snakes and fires 
and skull.

1918
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,870
You know what's and and things that want
to eat you.

1919
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:26,290
You might think why.
One answer is,

1920
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,700
well,
that's just what it's like,

1921
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,450
but then that's a problem because that's
not just what it's like.

1922
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:34,730
You know that the opposite is there.
And you might say,

1923
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:36,140
well where,
where the hell is that?

1924
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:41,160
Like why is it hard to get space for me?
And one answer is I reality is cannot be

1925
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:45,203
contentedly that's one ass.
But that's like you're depressed and 

1926
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,150
hopeless like you're done.
Here's another answer.

1927
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:58,060
You might be doing something wrong and 
then you might think,

1928
01:44:58,061 --> 01:45:00,160
well what would it mean to be doing 
something wrong?

1929
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:01,783
And then we might say,
maybe you're hanging onto something you 

1930
01:45:04,571 --> 01:45:05,404
value a little too tightly,
maybe one of your axiomatic 

1931
01:45:08,801 --> 01:45:11,440
presuppositions,
like the thing that's at the top of your

1932
01:45:11,441 --> 01:45:12,274
damn value structure is actually 
sufficiently outdated or pathological 

1933
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:19,683
such that if you hold onto it all,
you're going to get his rounds and 

1934
01:45:24,731 --> 01:45:25,564
misery.

1935
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:30,110
So maybe you have to let it go.
That's a sacrifice.

1936
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:33,620
And so maybe that's why the rule is when
you're making sacrifices to Kelly,

1937
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,640
you don't sacrifice the low quality 
junk.

1938
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:43,610
You sacrifice the stuff that you were 
attached to you because if things aren't

1939
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:44,444
going right,
it could be that it's because you're 

1940
01:45:46,581 --> 01:45:49,490
attached to the wrong things.
Now that's interesting.

1941
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:50,383
That's starting to get very interesting 
because that means that people are 

1942
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:56,540
starting to think maybe my attitude has 
something to do,

1943
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,753
something I can change.
Like maybe it's not just the factual 

1944
01:46:01,281 --> 01:46:02,114
nature of the external world.
It's something I can contend with and 

1945
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,393
dance with.
And maybe if I readjusted my moral 

1946
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:08,474
Schema,
the profitability is kind of low that 

1947
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:11,624
Kelly will be there all the time and 
it'll be pretty high that her positive 

1948
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:15,254
counterparts shows up.
So then the question might be how do we 

1949
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:18,823
set,
make the sacrifices that are necessary 

1950
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:21,464
to organize our schema of interpretation
in behavior such that when we 

1951
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:29,030
implemented in the world,
reality shines since positive face on us

1952
01:46:29,031 --> 01:46:29,864
in order it's negative face.
And like that's incredibly complicated 

1953
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:33,910
problems,
right?

1954
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,380
I mean that's,
that's problem.

1955
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:39,110
Human beings being trying to figure out 
at animals for that kind of forever,

1956
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,363
you know,
it wasn't until they were human beings 

1957
01:46:41,331 --> 01:46:44,750
that you started to get some conceptual 
representation.

1958
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,900
But then the other thing too is you guys
are all doing that.

1959
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:51,910
You haven't been back going with nature 
and the fattiest

1960
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,193
made some sacrifices right now.
Or maybe your parents are making 

1961
01:46:58,901 --> 01:47:01,360
sacrifices on your behalf and what's the
bed?

1962
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:03,730
The bed is.
It will be worth it.

1963
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,253
But what does that mean?
It means that if you make the proper 

1964
01:47:06,581 --> 01:47:09,250
sacrifices,
you discipline yourself.

1965
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:10,533
You don't,
you're not to dilute with your 

1966
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:16,720
resources.
You pay attention and you wait.

1967
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,163
Your life will be better.
That's pretty cool because it might be 

1968
01:47:22,031 --> 01:47:22,864
true and if it's true,
then none of this is illusion or 

1969
01:47:26,411 --> 01:47:29,380
delusion.
It's just low resolution.

1970
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,073
First pass representation that smart and
so you know from a Piagetian 

1971
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:39,980
perspective,
well,

1972
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,450
what do you do before you understand 
something,

1973
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,673
act it out.
And so the people that were making 

1974
01:47:45,811 --> 01:47:48,150
sacrifices,
they're acting out this idea.

1975
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:52,320
Do they know the idea is what you mean 
by?

1976
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:53,950
No,
no,

1977
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,200
you're acting it out.
They're dramatically representing you.

1978
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,090
Is that knowledge or it's a form of 
knowledge?

1979
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:04,980
Is it the kind of abstract knowledge 
that we're talking about right now?

1980
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,370
No,
but it's the immediate precursor to that

1981
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,353
you don't get from the phenomena to the 
articulation without running it through 

1982
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:13,764
some bodily representations and some 
drama and this is so damn complicated 

1983
01:48:17,481 --> 01:48:17,820
that,
you know,

1984
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,653
you probably couldn't get to it until 
you had civilizations that were pretty 

1985
01:48:21,181 --> 01:48:22,014
damn good.
And lots of people thinking about this 

1986
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:25,530
all the time,
you know,

1987
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:26,463
so the person who came up with this,
they would have experienced it as 

1988
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,120
religious revelation.

1989
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:34,330
It's like what's the nature of reality?
You get this image,

1990
01:48:34,331 --> 01:48:35,164
you know,
some of this multi armed goddess and 

1991
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:38,424
it's inflamed.
It's in a way up and it's like 

1992
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,930
terrifying.
It's terrifying you.

1993
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:43,813
You're gripped by it and you make a 
representation and part of the reason 

1994
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,510
you worship it is because the bloody 
thing is,

1995
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:50,373
is you when its grip and no wonder 
because there's an idea behind that is 

1996
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:56,580
so powerful that you shouldn't be 
gripped by it.

1997
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,900
You should be unable to forget it 
because it's,

1998
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,420
it's an absolute,
it's a stellar stroke of genius.

1999
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,313
It's a real revelation and it sets the 
whole human race on the path to making 

2000
01:49:08,611 --> 01:49:09,444
the proper sacrifices so that the fire 
and the bugs and the insects and the 

2001
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:18,801
snakes and the Tigers stay the hell away
and a good thing.

2002
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,480
It's a good thing.
And then maybe now and then you know,

2003
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:26,660
the world's can so that it's beneficial 
to us.

2004
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,360
I'm not sure if this would be greatest 
moment,

2005
01:49:30,361 --> 01:49:32,600
but um,
I asked a question before my shirt.

2006
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:33,763
You got to it last.
Did you can just directly stating when 

2007
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:37,950
you think of as an architect when you 
used the word

2008
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,100
well that's

2009
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,660
good.
That's a good question.

2010
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:51,303
This is an archetype,
but your behavioral reactions to that 

2011
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:56,613
could also the architect.
So I would say it's the expression of 

2012
01:50:02,021 --> 01:50:04,240
something that's at the foundation of 
knowledge,

2013
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,243
so it's like an innate axiom of 
representation and behave and it's 

2014
01:50:10,691 --> 01:50:14,260
archetypes that make us human rather 
than lines or ants.

2015
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:19,770
We have human architects and those are 
the things that we can dispense.

2016
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:23,780
They're built into us like,
well,

2017
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,200
jealousy would be an architect for 
example.

2018
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:29,440
It's an archetypal pattern,
hunger,

2019
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:30,603
thirst,
all of these things that are common to 

2020
01:50:32,081 --> 01:50:33,280
everyone,
but there are more.

2021
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,240
They're more conceptual archives to,
to like,

2022
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:37,840
like things,
you know,

2023
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:39,580
it's a,
it's a fuzzy word,

2024
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,010
but it,
it,

2025
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:42,843
it has to do with the element of 
idiation and action that are not merely 

2026
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:49,510
culturally constructed.
Let's say.

2027
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,373
Is it something like I'm in jeans,
something like there has to be a sub 

2028
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,773
straight,
but then it also has triggered or 

2029
01:50:57,421 --> 01:51:00,830
activated by something or is it just 
kind of all over again?

2030
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:02,280
Well,
that's a good question.

2031
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,270
That's a good question.
Um,

2032
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,340
I,
I don't,

2033
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:06,383
I think the,
I think I can answer that in some sense 

2034
01:51:07,921 --> 01:51:12,921
by analogy.
John would not be able to learn language

2035
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:17,800
unless they had the archetype of 
language at hand,

2036
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:20,590
right?
Does it have to be triggered?

2037
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:25,770
Twins sometimes come up with their own 
language,

2038
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,350
identical twins,
so they'll just create a life,

2039
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:30,763
you know,
and so there's a pretty powerful 

2040
01:51:31,511 --> 01:51:36,190
language creating capacity,
but generally speaking,

2041
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,893
yes,
it's triggered because you're thrown 

2042
01:51:38,921 --> 01:51:41,350
into an environment where,
which is the norm,

2043
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:44,320
but you can throw a chip in there and 
that's not going to work.

2044
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:45,693
Now what it is that makes people,
they are able to generate languages 

2045
01:51:51,730 --> 01:51:54,990
that's complicated because partly it's,
you have the right mouth,

2046
01:51:54,991 --> 01:51:57,580
you have the right timing,
you have the right throat,

2047
01:51:57,581 --> 01:52:00,010
you know,
and then you have the right brain,

2048
01:52:00,011 --> 01:52:01,780
whatever the hell that means.
And we don't,

2049
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:03,760
we don't exactly know what any of those 
things mean.

2050
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:07,750
So we use the word archetype to kind of 
cover rate in roots in some sense.

2051
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:13,260
Does the human psychological element of 
archetypes in your views change?

2052
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:14,653
Um,
change qualitatively when human beings 

2053
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,870
are having widespread access to board 
presentations?

2054
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:26,460
Hopefully.
Because otherwise it wouldn't be any.

2055
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:29,520
There wouldn't be any utility in 
developing your representations.

2056
01:52:30,030 --> 01:52:32,550
Mean I,
so I think the question you're asking in

2057
01:52:32,551 --> 01:52:37,551
some senses is representation useful and
the answer is so far so good,

2058
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:41,740
you know,
useful,

2059
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,950
but just that,
like the thing itself,

2060
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:44,813
once represented,
does that representation and now filter 

2061
01:52:46,521 --> 01:52:48,550
back in and then change this thing that 
started out.

2062
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:51,170
So I would say it doesn't happen all 
sorts of ways.

2063
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:52,723
So for example,
in some ways the dominance hierarchy is 

2064
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,430
a way that animals organize themselves 
in an environment,

2065
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:01,760
but if they do that long enough it 
becomes the environment,

2066
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:03,920
right?
Because once it's,

2067
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:06,830
once the adaptation is being there for 
100 million years,

2068
01:53:06,831 --> 01:53:09,260
it's no longer an outpatient.
It's part of the environment.

2069
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:13,100
So there's loops,
causal loops happening everywhere.

2070
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,263
So yeah,
the representation changes the 

2071
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:18,170
archetype.
God only knows how.

2072
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:19,640
And over what period of time.

2073
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:21,390
Yes,
yes,

2074
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:26,583
there is a relationship,
but I don't know enough about Hinduism 

2075
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:32,630
to tell you what it is.
So you know,

2076
01:53:32,631 --> 01:53:34,730
I'm not,
I'm not an expert on Hinduism,

2077
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,640
that's for sure.
It's very complicated religious system,

2078
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,380
you know,
but you know,

2079
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:42,410
I do know that these sub dailies,
so to speak,

2080
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:46,490
are manifestations of the ultimate 
reality when there's many,

2081
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:48,140
there's some utility in that because 
it's,

2082
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:51,830
it's monotheistic at one level of 
analysis and polytheistic and another,

2083
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:53,800
it makes it easier,
you know,

2084
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,673
you could think about these as bridges 
between the human and the absolute 

2085
01:53:58,521 --> 01:54:01,610
divine,
the absolute divine so damn abstract and

2086
01:54:01,611 --> 01:54:04,460
distant that it's hard to have any 
relationship with it.

2087
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:07,800
You need intermediary structures and the
saints are like that.

2088
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:09,240
Catholicism,
you know,

2089
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,420
because they're sort of God's roughly 
speaking,

2090
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:12,254
but they're sort of human.
So when you could kind of understand 

2091
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:17,440
them and their fractionated out and so 
the only representative of the day,

2092
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:18,633
you know,
so they're not the whole thing all at 

2093
01:54:20,031 --> 01:54:22,150
once,
which is a bit much to contend with.

2094
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,423
So,
so you think having diverse vocabulary 

2095
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:32,870
of health people,
I don't know if it helps it.

2096
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:40,230
Say that again.
Um,

2097
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:44,750
it helps them differentiated now.
Okay.

2098
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:45,643
And articulate.
So now we want to think about what that 

2099
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:49,260
means.
Okay.

2100
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,113
So I think I've told you before,
I've seen children that haven't been 

2101
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:56,000
played up with enough,
so maybe they're five or six and they're

2102
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:59,000
kind of,
they're like little Frankenstein,

2103
01:54:59,150 --> 01:54:59,983
you know,
you're kind of uninformed and kind of 

2104
01:55:01,821 --> 01:55:06,140
cloudy and clueless and they bump into 
things like other kids,

2105
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:07,810
you know,
and so they're,

2106
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,910
they're not articulated well.
And so the other kids usually won't play

2107
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:14,600
with them because they're sort of that a
three year old level of development when

2108
01:55:14,601 --> 01:55:16,300
they should be at a six year old devil 
of development.

2109
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,420
Just puts the other kids off,
you know,

2110
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:22,730
they find it creepy and there's reasons 
for that that I won't go into.

2111
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:26,000
But those kids aren't differentiated,
you know,

2112
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:30,140
they haven't got the extremely high 
level movements down.

2113
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:35,690
And so as you articulate an archetype 
and it diversifies,

2114
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:40,100
you become more adapted to multiple 
places.

2115
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:41,623
So that's what you want to do.
You want to take the damn archetype and 

2116
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:47,190
differentiated like mad because for 
example,

2117
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:48,024
when you're looking at a woman,
you don't want to see only the 

2118
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:52,980
archetype.
First of all,

2119
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:55,200
you'd be on your knees if that happened.
Believe me,

2120
01:55:55,201 --> 01:55:57,220
there's lots of men like that.
They're really are.

2121
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,760
It's animal possession.
It's way more common than you think.

2122
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:01,770
I see this with male clients all the 
time.

2123
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:02,843
If they're attracted to a woman,
her mere presence is so god damn 

2124
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:05,874
overwhelming that it just ties.
They're talking about the naughts and 

2125
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:10,500
what's happening is they're not seeing 
the individual.

2126
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:15,570
You're seeing the archetype and 
archetype is life is just too much.

2127
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,600
Now,
what's interesting is the archetype does

2128
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:21,570
shine through the woman.
It's real,

2129
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:22,583
but the individual part is real too.
Unless the guy is capable of 

2130
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:27,293
differentiating the archetype into that 
actual woman to woman won't have 

2131
01:56:30,901 --> 01:56:31,734
anything to do with him or maybe she'll 
play with them like a spider plays with 

2132
01:56:34,261 --> 01:56:37,170
the fly and it serves them right too.
But,

2133
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,990
but so you have to have both,
you know?

2134
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:44,100
And so that's partly why.
Remember Sleeping Beauty,

2135
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,900
the Disney movie,
you know how the,

2136
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:49,080
the hero is put into a castle by the 
evil queen,

2137
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:51,990
right?
And then sleeping beauty is sleeping.

2138
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:53,443
And so then he has to fight his way 
through this architectural 

2139
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:56,424
representation,
which actually transforms itself into 

2140
01:56:58,771 --> 01:56:59,604
the dragon of chaos.
He has to fight his way all through all 

2141
01:57:01,921 --> 01:57:05,430
of that before it can actually get to 
the real woman.

2142
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:08,510
And that's exactly what happens with men
as they develop poor,

2143
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,990
failed to develop is the first thing to 
the degree that they're immature.

2144
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,833
All they see is the archetype,
and they're very inferior in 

2145
01:57:15,191 --> 01:57:18,120
relationship to the archetype because 
unless they were Christ,

2146
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:20,910
so to speak,
you know they're going to be at.

2147
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:24,930
You're going to be on their needs.
And so to contend with,

2148
01:57:24,931 --> 01:57:25,764
the archetype means first of all,
to elevate the mail because as he 

2149
01:57:28,921 --> 01:57:30,480
contends with it,
he develops,

2150
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,000
right?
But at it also means to,

2151
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:34,093
to to place the two equality.
And then the archetype turns into the 

2152
01:57:38,371 --> 01:57:39,204
individual woman.
Now that's a big sacrifice because you 

2153
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:43,260
know,
hypothetically,

2154
01:57:43,261 --> 01:57:44,094
you rather have sleeping beauty that 
pretend princess in some actual woman 

2155
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,114
with all her trouble.
But the problem is there isn't sleeping 

2156
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:53,430
beauty that pretending princess.
There's just the real woman.

2157
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,040
And you see that with Peter Pan to the 
story.

2158
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:58,260
Because he's got tinker bell,
that's fine,

2159
01:57:58,261 --> 01:58:01,020
except for Tinkerbell to ferry and they 
don't exist,

2160
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,540
so he could have wendy if he would grow 
up,

2161
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:04,374
but he doesn't want to grow up,
so he's not going to get Wendy's just 

2162
01:58:06,451 --> 01:58:10,740
been in state king of the bloody lost 
boys and that will be the end of that.

2163
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,113
So,
so it's differentiation of architects 

2164
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:17,400
and that's what you're doing as you 
develop across time.

2165
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:21,210
Now there's a book called the origins 
and history of consciousness,

2166
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:25,350
which was written by a guy named Eric 
normand and it's a book that's very much

2167
01:58:25,351 --> 01:58:26,184
like maps are being because I believe 
that NASA meeting has been written four 

2168
01:58:28,561 --> 01:58:30,080
times.
Um,

2169
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:31,663
it's symbols of transformation and 
growth that it's origins and history of 

2170
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:37,230
consciousness.
Eric Norman,

2171
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:41,860
who was a student of young,
wrote that and it's also Becker's denial

2172
01:58:41,861 --> 01:58:42,694
of death and it's because you know,
when there's elements and heidegger are 

2173
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:49,840
very similar because all that's all 
working on the same problem.

2174
01:58:49,841 --> 01:58:52,720
But one of the things that's lovely 
about knowing that he's very smart about

2175
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,583
this,
he describes the acquisition of 

2176
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:58,330
knowledge as the differentiation of the 
archetypes.

2177
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:01,030
And that's brilliant.
It's right,

2178
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:01,893
it's like the thing itself is a unified 
whole that sort of the divine ground of 

2179
01:59:05,891 --> 01:59:06,430
reality.

2180
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:09,430
Then it fragments into the first three 
layers,

2181
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:12,760
masculine,
feminine and Chai,

2182
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:14,523
and then that fragments and hopefully 
what it does is fragments right down to 

2183
01:59:17,321 --> 01:59:20,080
the level of individuals so that when 
you're interacting with someone,

2184
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:21,273
you're interacting to their with their 
individual expression of the archetypal 

2185
01:59:24,611 --> 01:59:25,444
reality because then you're actually 
interacting with the person and that'll 

2186
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,453
get you a lot farther in any kind of 
relationship than being blown over by 

2187
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:38,281
the architect project or would it be.
I don't think you project them.

2188
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:43,180
It's not like you have a choice.
It's.

2189
01:59:43,181 --> 01:59:44,014
That's how you see the world.
It's the default because it projection 

2190
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:50,440
implies that you could be doing 
something else.

2191
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,320
It's like everything you see is an 
archetype.

2192
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:55,083
Although some of them are differentiated
and they can become extremely 

2193
01:59:58,271 --> 02:00:01,480
differentiated in so far as you know,
come to know a person,

2194
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:04,330
you know,
if you're reading I to get differentiate

2195
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:05,164
the damn thing down to the level of 
individual recognition and you're so 

2196
02:00:07,811 --> 02:00:10,460
skilled at that,
but the archetypal reality reestablishes

2197
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:13,360
itself and then you get to have your 
cake and eat it too.

2198
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:14,323
Okay.
So one of the things that you can 

2199
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:17,223
conceptualize marriage,
because marriage is a human universal 

2200
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:22,780
vitally something to think about.
You know,

2201
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:26,320
so it looks like it's built into us 
pretty hard at a biological level.

2202
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:29,440
So there's variations obviously and 
there's the,

2203
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,470
there are certain attractions and 
believe me,

2204
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,240
especially for men,
but all things considered,

2205
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,163
no matter where you looked in the world,
there's generally an attempt by the 

2206
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:38,764
culture to st a man that woman pair now 
young was trying to figure out why the 

2207
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:46,030
hell that would be it.
I mean there's the biological necessity.

2208
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:46,864
Obviously you've gotten raised kids 
somehow and there shouldn't just be one 

2209
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:49,774
of you,
but you don't want to just reduce 

2210
02:00:51,521 --> 02:00:53,250
everything down to the,
you know,

2211
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,960
to the level of two rats living 
together,

2212
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:58,750
even though that's an important level 
and know.

2213
02:00:58,751 --> 02:00:59,584
He said that one of the things that's 
really useful about evolve is that you 

2214
02:01:03,491 --> 02:01:06,580
can't run away from the damn thing if 
it's an actual viable.

2215
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:09,280
So what you're supposed to do when you 
marry someone is you say,

2216
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:10,114
look,
I'm stuck with you and we're going to 

2217
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:16,350
bet on this because we only get five 
shots at it anyways,

2218
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:17,193
and you know,
you're the least awful person I've come 

2219
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:19,414
across and so let's tie ourselves 
together so we cannot escape and see 

2220
02:01:23,171 --> 02:01:24,004
what happens.
And so then you think if you take that 

2221
02:01:26,831 --> 02:01:28,240
seriously,
you think,

2222
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:29,103
oh my God,
I'm stuck with this damn person for the 

2223
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:32,510
rest of my life.
Also.

2224
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:36,520
Then when,
if you really can't escape,

2225
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:38,763
you think,
well,

2226
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:39,813
keep better,
build something out of this because 

2227
02:01:41,061 --> 02:01:41,894
we're stuck in it.
And so you don't conceptualize the 

2228
02:01:43,851 --> 02:01:44,684
marriage as an all chemical containers,
and he derived this from the studies on 

2229
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:53,180
alchemy where two opposite substances 
were placed together in a container they

2230
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:58,511
could not escape from and then exposed 
to heat and the heat,

2231
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:00,740
the relationship obviously,
and all the emotions,

2232
02:02:00,741 --> 02:02:01,574
but the relationship generates,
they're exposed to heat and they can't 

2233
02:02:03,501 --> 02:02:04,820
get out of the damn container.

2234
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:06,060
What happens?
Well,

2235
02:02:06,061 --> 02:02:06,894
there's a transmutation.
Transmutation is a consequence of the 

2236
02:02:10,791 --> 02:02:12,680
exchange of information.
So,

2237
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,930
and we know this works at a biological 
level,

2238
02:02:14,931 --> 02:02:15,764
right?
So part of the reason that there is sex 

2239
02:02:18,141 --> 02:02:18,974
is because if we split your DNA down the
middle and that it's something that's 

2240
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:24,890
exactly to say wherever there is a 
weakness,

2241
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:25,724
the two weaknesses are going to combine 
and you're going to end up with 

2242
02:02:27,921 --> 02:02:30,080
offspring.
They're all mocked up.

2243
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:32,480
Now that's basically a consequence of 
inbreeding.

2244
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:37,010
So what you want to do is you want to 
take your applaud genetic substance,

2245
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:37,620
which is,
you know,

2246
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:41,210
99 point nine percent good.
And someone else's blog,

2247
02:02:41,211 --> 02:02:45,350
genetic substances snap them together 
and hope like hell that the errors don't

2248
02:02:45,351 --> 02:02:47,420
match up.
And they probably won't.

2249
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:49,040
And so that's what you're doing in a 
relationship.

2250
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:49,874
It's like,
you know,

2251
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,130
you're screwing somebody,
you cap ex and so is the other person.

2252
02:02:53,130 --> 02:02:53,963
Then.
So when you slap those two things 

2253
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:57,560
together and you hope that I'll of that 
you build in totality.

2254
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,203
Okay?
And that starts the information flow 

2255
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:01,214
moving.
So then the question is what would you 

2256
02:03:04,761 --> 02:03:08,170
do if the information flow was a 
curator?

2257
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:09,170
What,
what happened to you?

2258
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:13,310
So let's say you're 20 percent work,
which,

2259
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:17,510
which is taste pretty good and your 
partner's 20 percent more to,

2260
02:03:17,511 --> 02:03:18,790
but our,
luckily you're warps.

2261
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:19,624
Don't match up what that means.
If you listen to each other over a long 

2262
02:03:23,661 --> 02:03:26,150
enough period of time,
if you really communicated,

2263
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:28,730
then you wouldn't be warped anymore and 
neither would the other person.

2264
02:03:28,731 --> 02:03:29,564
And then you'd have the archetypal 
situation as well as the individual 

2265
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:33,230
situation.
Right?

2266
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,513
You see what I mean?
Because you both have been elevated up 

2267
02:03:36,591 --> 02:03:39,860
to the point where you're not full of 
holes anymore.

2268
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:41,503
And you think,
well that's part of the purpose in so 

2269
02:03:42,441 --> 02:03:46,040
far as there's this psychological and 
spiritual function of marriage.

2270
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,320
That's it.
And so you can,

2271
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:49,790
you can have freedom.
You could say,

2272
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:51,860
well this is a,
not that we can untie,

2273
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:57,050
but the problem with that is you don't 
have to contend with the person then.

2274
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:58,690
No,
you don't get.

2275
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,533
You don't have to take it seriously.
You don't have to take it as if it's 

2276
02:04:02,901 --> 02:04:05,550
life and death.
But the problem is it is,

2277
02:04:05,551 --> 02:04:07,430
it is life and death.
It is.

2278
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:08,593
Maybe you can have another shot at it.
I don't see why you think you'll do 

2279
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:13,640
better the second time because all the 
evidence suggests that you won't.

2280
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:15,710
The divorce rate higher for second 
marriages.

2281
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:17,343
So like you know,
the thing about being tied to someone 

2282
02:04:19,701 --> 02:04:20,534
who isn't you is that they're not.
You have something to tell you if you 

2283
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:26,264
listen.
And so then you start with the flawed 

2284
02:04:27,861 --> 02:04:30,800
individual and if you're paying yourself
against each other enough,

2285
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:36,130
what you hope is that you both develop 
and you shared your excess baggage along

2286
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,670
the way.
And that can happen.

2287
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:40,920
You know,
it's a good thing if it happens.

2288
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:42,840
You live longer,
you have a better life,

2289
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:44,173
the situation for your children.
It's like everybody wins in that 

2290
02:04:46,561 --> 02:04:47,790
situation.
Okay,

2291
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:53,350
let's.
You're all getting restless,

2292
02:04:54,490 --> 02:04:57,810
so let's stop and come back and come 
back in 10 minutes.
