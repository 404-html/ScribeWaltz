1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,580
Hi there.
So welcome to maps of meaning.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,093
I'm,
I'm going to tell you a story to begin 

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,384
with and then we'll take a break and 
after the break then I'll give you more 

4
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:20,961
details about the class structure.
If you want to know more about the class

5
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:21,924
structure,
all you have to do is go look at the 

6
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,390
syllabus online.
If you type my name into Google,

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,440
you'll get my website and then all the 
courses are listed there.

8
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,274
And then you just go to the course 
website and it tells you everything you 

9
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,514
need to know.
I'll give you just a brief overview for 

10
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,060
now.
Um,

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,733
there's a main textbook which I presume 
you may have already purchased and 

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,470
perhaps not.
It's available at the bookstore.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,023
And then there's some adjunct readings 
that are listed on the website that are 

14
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
scientific papers that serve as 
appropriate additional background 

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,124
material,
mostly concentrating on neuroscience 

16
00:00:58,201 --> 00:00:59,034
material.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Um,
and so that's the readings and the order

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,480
of the readings is also laid out on the 
website.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,210
Uh,
in terms of assignments,

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,700
there are three,
three,

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,720
three and a half in a sense.
But the first one is,

22
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,554
uh,
I've developed some writing exercises 

23
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,570
over the last few years for students and
um,

24
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,490
they're on a website right now called 
self authoring.com

25
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:24,324
which you don't have to worry about 
because you have access to the programs 

26
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,510
through this course website.
Um,

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,990
I'll tell you about the two writing,
personal writing essays first.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,010
So there's a lot of evidence that has 
accrued over the last 15 or 20 years.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,773
Some of it stemming from the 
psychoanalytic tradition that writing 

30
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:53,991
about your life fundamentally has 
extraordinary benefits.

31
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,460
I would say some of them are health 
benefits because it,

32
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:00,120
it,
it seems that,

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,410
and this is something we'll cover to a 
great degree in this course,

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,520
it seems that if there are elements in 
your past that you haven't dealt with or

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,780
areas of uncertainty in your current 
life or in your future considerations,

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,930
then you bury heavy stress load because 
of that.

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,273
Uh,
your body really doesn't like 

38
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,770
uncertainty that much.
And oddly enough,

39
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,720
there can be uncertainty still in the 
past.

40
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,554
You know,
if things have happened to you that you 

41
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,870
really don't understand your,
your,

42
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,823
your body and your brains seem to 
respond to that as if it's an area of 

43
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,304
dangerous territory that,
that that has the potential in some 

44
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,790
sense to haunt you.
And one of the ways that your body seems

45
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,470
to respond to that is by producing high 
levels of stress hormones like cortisol.

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,543
And the reason your body does that is 
because the more dangerous you're 

47
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:48,654
environment is,
the more you should be prepared to act 

48
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:51,444
rapidly at any given moment.
And that's fine except that it's costly 

49
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,840
from a psychophysiological perspective,
you know,

50
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,823
it's demanding,
it's physiologically demanding in what 

51
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
that means.
Is that over any reasonable span of 

52
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,230
time,
it actually hurts you.

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,850
Now.
So writing about your past,

54
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,684
especially about things that were 
somewhat difficult and hard to 

55
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,094
understand seems to,
well it seems to lower the degree to 

56
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:25,290
which you're haunted by uncertainty and,
and then the,

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,223
so I have one assignment for you,
which is writing an autobiography and 

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,280
there is a structured program online 
that guides you through that.

59
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,114
And basically what it asks you to do is 
to divide your life into seven epochs 

60
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,723
stages and then to write about the what 
you experienced during those epochs for 

61
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:47,134
better or for worse,
and then to try to understand them and 

62
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:54,151
to articulate them.
And partly I want you to do that because

63
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,440
I,
I think it's,

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,280
it's a thing that is good to do,
especially for people your age,

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
especially when you're stopped stopping 
one thing which you are going to be 

66
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,660
doing soon in starting another.
It's a good thing to get caught up.

67
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,370
The other reason I want you to do it 
though is because this course deals with

68
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,204
narrative in the psychology of narrative
and the relationship between narrative 

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,320
and your own personal experience.
And there's no reason not to utilize the

70
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:29,960
theoretical propositions that we're 
going to walk through in a,

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,813
in a personal and practical sense at the
same time that you come to understand 

72
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,620
them theoretically.
So,

73
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,263
so you'll be asked to do that.
It's actually the first assignment and 

74
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:44,890
then that will be given two to three of 
you.

75
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,813
Each person's essay will be given to 
three classmates and they'll provide 

76
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:50,854
feedback on it.
So what I usually recommend is that you 

77
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,584
write the autobiography for yourself.
The program will provide you with a 

78
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,710
complete printout.
Then you can edit it,

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,933
you know,
because there may be things that you 

80
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,610
want to write about that you don't want 
anybody to read.

81
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,013
Now part of the reason I instituted this
was because it's impossible for the tas 

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,053
to grade and assess that many 
assignments because there's three 

83
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,290
assignments and I don't know how many 
people are in the class.

84
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,620
Probably somewhere between 60 and 80,
which I guess would be 70.

85
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,520
Um,
yeah.

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,480
Yeah.
And that's 210 assignments.

87
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,730
Like that's just not going to happen.
So,

88
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,693
and I didn't want to cut the writing out
of the class because I think it's 

89
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,624
foolish to do that.
So we use a peer grading system and the 

90
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:38,914
way that works is that you get your,
you get feedback from three peers and 

91
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,800
you get the average of the best two 
grades.

92
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,340
And then you're also marked on the 
feedback that you provide.

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,713
Now what's happened in the past,
although this wasn't something I 

94
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,384
expected,
is that students have actually found it 

95
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:58,880
extremely useful to read the 
autobiographical essays of their peers.

96
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,743
Because you know you don't really know 
that much about other people and you 

97
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,824
don't know how how similar you are to 
the more how different you are from 

98
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,214
them.
And that's especially true if you're 

99
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,554
relatively young and having the 
opportunity to read the kind of writing 

100
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,300
that you're going to do that's being 
produced by other people turns out to be

101
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,790
something that everyone has found 
extraordinarily useful.

102
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,430
And I,
I'd like to take credit for that but I'm

103
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,180
not going to because I didn't really 
realize that it would be so useful.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,073
And what we're actually going to do in 
further developments of the program is 

105
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:31,084
set it up so that because people do use 
this on a private basis and we're using 

106
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,290
it in various places,
which I'll talk about in a minute,

107
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,840
I want to set it up so that when people 
use it,

108
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,674
they can post their final product online
and have people comment on it and then 

109
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,240
have the comments voted up or down.

110
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,073
You know,
so I,

111
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,243
so I'm trying to,
I'm thinking about are planning to 

112
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,394
develop a site where people who are 
interested in psychology could go and 

113
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,164
practice their skills because it's very 
useful for people to have feedback on 

114
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,210
what they've written.
You know,

115
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,133
if it's constructive feedback and 
constructive feedback should be 

116
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,680
something like,
well,

117
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:07,514
you know,
I really didn't understand what you 

118
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,480
meant here and this seemed kind of vague
and you know,

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,830
I really liked what you did here.
I think it's clear,

120
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,664
I understand what you're doing.
It seems to be well articulated and 

121
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,994
delineated.
And so that's the next stage of the 

122
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,380
project and that'll be coming along 
relatively soon.

123
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,970
But anyways,
for now,

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,253
you'll start with the autobiography.
And I would recommend that you start it 

125
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:30,530
now while like not this second because 
here we are in this class,

126
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,710
but you know as soon as possible because
it's,

127
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,220
it's actually quite demanding.

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,353
And if you wait,
you'll find that you can't do it and 

129
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:39,170
then you'll be annoyed.
And you know,

130
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,480
the whole purpose of the exercise will 
be lost.

131
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,314
Plus it's also extremely useful to do it
over multiple occasions and sleep in 

132
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:51,611
between writing sessions because the 
evidence seems to suggest that if you're

133
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:55,490
doing autobiographical and exploratory 
writing,

134
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,593
that you need the downtime to sleep in 
order to consolidate the changes you're 

135
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,730
making in your representational 
structures.

136
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,760
And so doing it over multiple periods is
first of all,

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,973
um,
it's the only way really to do it 

138
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,080
because it's too difficult to do it in 
one sitting,

139
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,720
but it's also more beneficial.
Now,

140
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,660
one thing you might think about,
and,

141
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,930
and,
and this,

142
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,764
this appears to be this situation,
is that your personalities actually 

143
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,610
organized at the highest level of 
analysis through articulation.

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,871
You know,
cause you're,

145
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:24,704
you're a,
you're a hierarchical 

146
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,730
psychophysiological structure that 
that's one way of looking at it.

147
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,893
And that that structure has to be 
organized and unified because otherwise 

148
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,680
you're like a little collection of 
warring spirits and that's,

149
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,543
that's not an efficient and effective or
happy way live that involves a lot of 

150
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:41,864
suffering.
And so the more you're able to 

151
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:48,050
articulate yourself as an entity,
the more clearly defined you are.

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,220
And the more that,
the consequence of that clear definition

153
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,310
in unity is that you're not going to be 
a house that's divided unto itself.

154
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,773
And that's,
and that's an extraordinarily useful 

155
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,021
thing.
I mean,

156
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,854
one of the goals for most clinical 
processes is the integration of the 

157
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,980
personality,
right?

158
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,814
To make you an individual.
And an individual is something that's 

159
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,543
not divided.
And the autobiographical exercise will 

160
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,174
help with that.
And students have claimed in the past 

161
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,530
and that they've been able to put a lot 
of things that have been disturbing them

162
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:26,100
to rest as a consequence of writing 
through it and thinking about it now,

163
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,730
you know,
there's nothing particularly magic about

164
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:30,564
writing,
but there is something magic about 

165
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,054
thinking.

166
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,253
And there's something particularly magic
about thinking accurately and precisely 

167
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,540
about important things,
you know,

168
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,374
and the re the advantage of doing that 
through writing is that you can be much 

169
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:47,580
more precise and accurate because you 
get to externalize your thinking,

170
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,443
right?
Which is what you do when you write it 

171
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,004
down.
And then you can think about what you 

172
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,704
thought about so you can engage in a 
recursive process that enables you to 

173
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,474
sharpen up your words and sharpen up the
representations and extract out the 

174
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:04,530
proper causal relationships that make up
your experience.

175
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,460
And you know,
the,

176
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,670
the point of memory,
people think,

177
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,504
well,
the point of memory is to remember the 

178
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:13,530
past and that's complete rubbish.
That's not the point of memory at all.

179
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,663
The point of memory is to extract out 
useful information from your experience 

180
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,110
so you don't run into the same wall 
repeatedly as you move through life.

181
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,380
And so if you know,
if you have things in your past that you

182
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,750
don't really comprehend and that are 
still disturbing you,

183
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,823
what that means in some sense is that 
there are areas of the world that you 

184
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,094
don't comprehend well.
And that's not good because those areas 

185
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:36,414
exist.
Even though you encountered them in the 

186
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,540
past,
that doesn't mean they're gone.

187
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,123
And it,
it also means that there are places in 

188
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:47,571
your past that are in some sense loaded 
with information that you can extract.

189
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,474
And in some real way,
you make your psyche out of the 

190
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,280
information that you extract from your 
experience.

191
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,470
That's a kind of a Piagetian 
presupposition.

192
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,611
I mean,
your,

193
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,100
your psyche,
your personality comes from somewhere.

194
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,770
It just doesn't observe.
You know,

195
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,613
we emerge out of nothing.
And so you can mine your past for 

196
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,590
information that you have not completely
comprehended in,

197
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,424
in that way.

198
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,070
You can expand your personality and your
competence.

199
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,920
And,
and so I would also recommend,

200
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,780
and because this is also a motif of the 
courses,

201
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,030
when you do the exercise,
like pay attention to your words because

202
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,520
you're using your words to construct 
your personality.

203
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,870
You know,
and that's,

204
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,023
I mean,
one of the great discoveries in some 

205
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,640
sense of,
of,

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,623
of human culture is that there's a 
relationship between the word and the 

207
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,880
construction of the world.
It's a,

208
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,070
it's a fundamental relationship.
You know,

209
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:41,550
and if you're precise and careful with 
your words and with your writing,

210
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,030
then what you call into existence for 
yourself as a well defined,

211
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:48,720
at sharply defined personality and a 
sharply defined world.

212
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,550
And that's one in which you can,
you can act and,

213
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:52,171
and,
and,

214
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,004
and,
and obtain the consequences of those 

215
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,120
actions that is necessary to sustain 
you.

216
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,190
So I would say if you treat this 
exercise like a class exercise,

217
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,870
then you're missing the point 
completely.

218
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,090
It's not a class exercise.
It's,

219
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,510
it's something that's designed to bring 
you up to date,

220
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,930
to free you from your past and to allow 
you to move forward into the future.

221
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,020
Untrammeled by things that you might be 
dragging behind you.

222
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,090
So you,
there,

223
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,943
there are instructions in the program 
that tell you what state of mind to 

224
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,380
place yourself into,
but,

225
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,740
but I'll,
I'll,

226
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,693
I'll describe it briefly.
Now you want to be in something that 

227
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,700
that's like a reverie,
you know,

228
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,210
when a reverie is like,
it's,

229
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,083
it's,
it's a state of mind that allows you in 

230
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,610
some sense to daydream.
You know,

231
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,840
sometimes when you're sitting and you're
not necessarily focused on anything,

232
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:44,440
which is increasingly rare these days,
your mind will wander,

233
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,140
you know,
and sometimes it wanders into the future

234
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,710
and sometimes it wanders around problems
that you have from day to day.

235
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:55,711
And sometimes it wanders into the past 
to sort of circle around things that are

236
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,430
still consuming you.

237
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,260
And that's the state of mind you want to
be in.

238
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,993
So you can bring up to the surface 
issues that are relevant and important 

239
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,130
and then start to articulate them and to
address them.

240
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,103
You know,
as the relatively well educated adult 

241
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:16,510
that you are now.
So and all,

242
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,344
sometimes people are hurt by past 
experiences because they're too young 

243
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,584
and too cognitively naive and 
unsophisticated to actually understand 

244
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,380
what's going on and to place it in a 
broader context.

245
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,420
And the fact that you're,
you know,

246
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,670
you,
you become educated and that you're,

247
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
you're,
well mostly that you've become educated.

248
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,063
You might,
you may have the opportunity to re 

249
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,680
reconstru and recast some of the things 
that you've been thinking about,

250
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,360
you know,
and carrying along behind you.

251
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,194
So that's assignment one.
And I really would recommend get at it 

252
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,200
because it's not something you can do in
the last moment.

253
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,170
Not without causing yourself misery and 
grief.

254
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,843
The third assignment is it the same kind
of writing exercise except it's about 

255
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,180
the future.
Now,

256
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,014
one of the propositions that this course
is predicated upon is the idea that 

257
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,083
you're always in a cognitive schema that
contains at least two points of 

258
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,164
reference and one is point a roughly 
speaking in one is point b roughly 

259
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,084
speaking.
And that your life is a continual 

260
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,214
journey between point a and point b and 
point a is the present as you construe 

261
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:26,971
it and point b is the future that you're
heading to and in any moment you're,

262
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,683
you're,
you're operating with both those poles 

263
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,680
active regardless of what you're doing 
because you're a goal directed creature,

264
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,670
you're always aiming at something and in
order,

265
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,890
in order to obtain what you're aiming at
and in order to keep the structures that

266
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:49,540
you're using to organize your experience
functional and pristine,

267
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,870
you need to have a well defined sense of
where you are now and you need to have a

268
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,704
well defined sense of where you're going
in the future and why you're going 

269
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:58,214
there.

270
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,620
Now this,
this exercise,

271
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,454
which is the third assignment,
asks you to put yourself in the same 

272
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,534
state of mind that would be particularly
appropriate for the past offering 

273
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,243
exercise,
except that you're projecting yourself 

274
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,410
three to five years into the future.
Um,

275
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,480
that ability,
by the way,

276
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,690
probably only emerges at about the age 
that all you guys are.

277
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,670
I've tried doing this exercise with high
school kids and it's,

278
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,593
they can't do it.
So we're making a high school version 

279
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,923
where the kids have to think three to 
six months into the future because that 

280
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,580
seems to be really all they can manage,
you know?

281
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:35,570
Um,
so,

282
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,970
but you're at,
you're at a point where you know,

283
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:38,804
you can cast a future self farther out.
And so the idea is to put yourself in 

284
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,553
to,
to adopt a particular attitude towards 

285
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,660
yourself while you're writing the,
the,

286
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,620
the,
while you're completing the access size.

287
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,790
And that attitude is imagine that you're
someone who's,

288
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,690
who's care you're charged with.
You know?

289
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,524
So what I really mean is to sort of 
duplicate yourself and to take a 

290
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,050
particular attitude towards your future 
self.

291
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:10,040
And so the idea is if you were going to 
construct a future for a person,

292
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,210
that person being you and the future was
optimized,

293
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,500
not in some,
you know,

294
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,870
moronic,
dreamlike manner,

295
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,980
that that involves yachts and,
and,

296
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,740
and supermodels.
Um,

297
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,740
but something that's realistic and 
something that you can actually apply.

298
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:31,100
So if you were constructing the future 
that would be best for you,

299
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,730
all things considered,
what would that look like?

300
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,893
And so the first part of the exercise 
asks you to consider what I regard as 

301
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,440
the basic,
the most fundamental dimensions of human

302
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,880
existence.
And you know,

303
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:46,400
those already.
What makes up life,

304
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,580
career,
family,

305
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,250
friends,
intimate relationships,

306
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,353
activities that you undertake on your 
own time and concerns that are related 

307
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,510
to health,
including use of drugs and alcohol.

308
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,260
So those aren't the only dimensions but 
their fundamental dimensions.

309
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,094
And so what I'm asking you to do and 
what the program will ask you to do is 

310
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,211
to think,
okay,

311
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:10,940
if you could optimize your life along 
all of those dimensions,

312
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:11,774
exactly what it would look like.
Because one thing you can be sure of is 

313
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,450
that if you're not aiming at something,
you're not going to hit it.

314
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,720
The other thing you can be sure of is if
you're not aiming at something,

315
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,033
someone else will aim you at something 
for some reason or some force that you 

316
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,514
don't understand at all.
We'll aim you at something and you may 

317
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,304
end up getting something you seriously 
don't want and I would not recommend 

318
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,100
that.
It's a stumbling through your life.

319
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,070
Aimlessly is not a good strategy.
You end up,

320
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,803
you could end up some terrible places,
but you will certainly end up as a pawn 

321
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:44,570
of things that you may not want to be a 
pawn of.

322
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,093
Now we've used this program,
we've tested this program quite 

323
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,080
thoroughly so far.
We've used it for to begin with.

324
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:55,770
We used it for students at mcgill who 
were struggling academically,

325
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,980
so you know there are smart kids,
but they were all,

326
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,883
they were on academic probation and they
filled out the future authoring program 

327
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,654
and raise their grade.
Point average is 25% drop the dropout 

328
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:07,404
rate by 30% and so,
which was quite stunning because it's 

329
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,760
very difficult to improve people.
You know,

330
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,250
it's easy to make the mortars but it's 
harder to make them better.

331
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,253
But then we've tested it now on more 
than 3000 students at the Rotterdam 

332
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,143
School of management.
And over four successive years we've 

333
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:28,611
raised the performance of the students.
25% drop their dropout rate by 30% seems

334
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:31,230
to be in,
in the Rotterdam samples.

335
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,064
It was particularly effective for men,
but we don't know what conclusions to 

336
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:38,160
draw from that because it was a 
business,

337
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,890
it's business program and there was a 
minority of women,

338
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,900
but they were outperforming the man.

339
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,733
And we don't know if that's a gender 
thing or if the women who were in the 

340
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:49,800
business program happened on average to 
be more committed and more intelligent,

341
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,080
more conscientious than the men who were
in it.

342
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,423
But anyways,
the point is is that it will ask you to 

343
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,170
consider those fundamental dimensions of
your life and to,

344
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,243
and to envision how they would be 
constructed if you could construct them 

345
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,684
properly.
And then it asks you to write for 20 

346
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,234
minutes after you've done that,
about what your future could be like in 

347
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,370
three to five years if it was optimally 
structured free writing.

348
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,400
And then it asks you to do something 
that's actually the reverse,

349
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,234
which is consider all your inadequacies 
and weaknesses and stupidities and 

350
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,734
foolishness and imagine what your life 
would be like if you really let them 

351
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,680
have the upper hand.
So,

352
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,690
and everybody I think has some sense of 
that,

353
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,524
you know,
because everyone has some sense of how 

354
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,150
they would go wrong if they were going 
to go wrong.

355
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,343
And it's a,
it seems to me to be a very useful 

356
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:44,061
exercise to allow yourself to envision 
where you could end up if you didn't get

357
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:45,840
your act together and,
and,

358
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,900
and put things straight.
And to me in some sense,

359
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:52,040
what that means is that you're outlining
your own personal heaven,

360
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,883
then your own personal hell.
And it's useful to have both of those 

361
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,544
because you can run away from what you 
don't want and you can run towards what 

362
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,740
you do want.
And that's quite motivating,

363
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,143
you know?
And one of the things I've observed 

364
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,394
quite regularly in my clinical practice 
is that people are often loath to make 

365
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,260
decisions that will cause conflict.
You know,

366
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,470
so say,
especially if they're agreeable people,

367
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:17,304
you know,
say that you want to pursue a career 

368
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:23,541
path that your parents don't agree with 
and it would take a fair bit of,

369
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,683
you know,
intense negotiation in order to free 

370
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:31,080
yourself up so that you could pursue 
that path.

371
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,910
It may be just as easy to let it go from
moment to moment because that's conflict

372
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,880
free and end up doing something that 
you're not committed to.

373
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
Then the question is,
then they'll,

374
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,290
where does that take you?
And if you have a very,

375
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,124
very clear idea of the kind of trouble 
you can get into by facing the actual 

376
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:49,264
realities of your life,
it makes you much more likely to fight 

377
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,190
for what you need to fight for in the 
present.

378
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,960
Because you know,
you know,

379
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,050
in some sense you're damned if you do 
and you're damned if you don't.

380
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,890
So you might as well take the chance and
struggle for what you want now.

381
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,850
And so defining a negative future can 
also be extremely useful.

382
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,170
So,
um,

383
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,640
plus it's,
you know,

384
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,020
it's,
it's realistic.

385
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,110
People's lives fall apart all the time.
It's uh,

386
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,183
you know,
you can expect that your life will fall 

387
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,150
apart at some point in one way or 
another.

388
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,540
So it's useful at least to prepare 
yourself so that that doesn't happen any

389
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,374
more often than it has to.
And that if you're going to engage in 

390
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,100
conflict and so forth in order to pursue
what you want,

391
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:30,934
that you have your rationale straight.
So the second part of the third part of 

392
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:39,661
the exercise has you develop a fully 
articulated rationale for your vision.

393
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,750
Now there's a bunch of reasons for that.
One is,

394
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,273
you know,
if you're having a discussion with 

395
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,074
someone,
I can tell you how the typical 

396
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,140
discussion about something important 
goes.

397
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,700
If you're having a conflict with 
someone,

398
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,520
it's usually someone close to you,
like person in your family,

399
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,743
you know,
you'll bring up something they don't 

400
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:57,910
want to hear.
Okay.

401
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
So then they'll tell you two or three 
reasons why that's actually your fault 

402
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,400
and not theirs.
And if you can,

403
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,980
and sometimes that'll set you right back
on your heels.

404
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,770
It's the end of the discussion,
especially if they're quite emphatic and

405
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:09,604
maybe aggressive about it.
If you can get past that and engage in 

406
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,030
the discussion and start to get 
somewhere while then they'll usually get

407
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,510
angry at you and then past that they'll 
cry.

408
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,510
And then past that you can have a 
discussion.

409
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,840
But in order to get to the point where 
you can actually have a discussion,

410
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:29,980
you have to have your arguments set up 
like soldiers behind you.

411
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,640
And so if you,
if you want to move towards a particular

412
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,040
goal,
you're going to run into impediments.

413
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,874
And some of those impediments will be 
other people and the voices in your own 

414
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,534
head for that matter.
And the more deeply you have your 

415
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:48,220
rationale for what you want articulated,
the more potent you are as a fighter for

416
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,320
your own destiny,
so to speak.

417
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,620
And so the third part of the exercise 
asks you to think deeply about why it is

418
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:59,710
that the future you want is important 
and not only to you,

419
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,020
because of course it's important that 
it's important to you,

420
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,854
but also what effect moving towards the 
future that you actually think would be 

421
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,374
best for you,
what effect that would have on your 

422
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:12,760
friends and your family and society at 
large.

423
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,623
Because those things also have to be 
taken into consideration when you're 

424
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,870
constructing what you might regard as 
your destiny.

425
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,560
And so these are very,
very important things to get right.

426
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,394
And one of the things that's really 
remarkably pathological about our 

427
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,054
current education system is that this 
sort of thing isn't done more regularly 

428
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,120
because I can't imagine,
since you know,

429
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:34,954
you're all university students,
there's absolutely nothing more 

430
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:41,761
important than you can possibly do then 
to spend some genuine time contemplating

431
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,720
who it is that you want to be as you 
expand yourself throughout life.

432
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,060
You know,
there should be whole courses devoted to

433
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,910
that and there isn't.
And there's weird reasons for that,

434
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,950
which I'll get into later.
But this,

435
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,371
uh,
this,

436
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:57,350
it gives you an opportunity to thank all
right.

437
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,440
Maybe I could have what would be best 
for me,

438
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,960
which by the way is different than what 
I want.

439
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,710
Maybe I could have what would be best 
for me if I knew what it was.

440
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,280
And I was actually aiming at it and my 
experience has been like,

441
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,114
I've watched people for many,
many years in all sorts of different 

442
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:13,934
situations and over very long periods of
time because I've had a clinical 

443
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:21,380
practice for more than 20 years now.
And I can tell you that if you know what

444
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:22,214
you're aiming at,
there's a pretty decent chance you can 

445
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,700
get it.
And if you don't know what you're aiming

446
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:26,534
at,
then God only knows where you're going 

447
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:30,530
to end up.
And it will not be a happy place.

448
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,000
So it's very much useful to,
to put some thought into this and to,

449
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,163
to,
to consciously take hold of and 

450
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:42,050
articulate what it is that you want for 
a destiny.

451
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,200
And there's no reason to assume that you
can't achieve it.

452
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,280
You know,
you're all smart.

453
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,333
We wouldn't be here and you're all 
reasonably hard working or maybe 

454
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:50,414
extremely hardworking or you wouldn't be
here and a good chunk of your probably 

455
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,190
creative.
So you know,

456
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:58,580
you have as good a chance of attaining 
what it,

457
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,070
what you could be as anyone.
And so,

458
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,340
you know,
I would say dream realistically,

459
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,683
you know,
or maturely that would be a better way 

460
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:11,000
of thinking about it.
But also don't be afraid to be ambitious

461
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:11,834
about what you want because you know the
world's full of possibility and there's 

462
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:21,350
no necessary reason that you can't make 
use of that possibility.

463
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,843
And I can tell you as well that you 
better make use of it because although 

464
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm sure you know this to some degree,
um,

465
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,283
at some of you do anyways,
life hits you hard and tragically 

466
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,760
multiple times throughout your 
existence.

467
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,260
And no one escapes from that.

468
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,933
And so the problem with that,
apart from the fact that it's painful 

469
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:47,030
and anxiety provoking and use,
that it can make you bitter.

470
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,410
And once you're bitter,
you're a dangerous person and,

471
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,083
and a miserable person.
And so the only way to protect yourself 

472
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:56,654
against that happening is to have the 
kind of life that's rich enough and 

473
00:25:59,151 --> 00:25:59,984
meaningful enough so that you're,
you can take the blows and accept it 

474
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,890
because there's no way you can escape 
from the blows there.

475
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,763
They are an inevitable part of life.
So your life better be rich enough so 

476
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,430
that you think,
okay,

477
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,880
well on balance the price I paid for 
being alive is worth it.

478
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,543
Um,
one of the things we're going to talk 

479
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,384
about in depth in this class is the 
social consequences of failing to do 

480
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:27,080
that because bitter people are 
extraordinary,

481
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,943
extraordinary dangerous from a 
sociological and a political 

482
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,794
perspective.

483
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,300
And so,
you know,

484
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,100
the,
the,

485
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,933
the ranks of the,
of the totalitarians of the past are 

486
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:39,740
full of people who are arrogant and 
resentful and you know,

487
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:42,440
that the steps past arrogance and 
resentment are,

488
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,280
you know,
murder and genocide.

489
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,360
And so,
you know,

490
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,650
the less of that,
the better.

491
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:47,484
So part of the utility and putting your 
personal house in order is that you're 

492
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,624
much less likely to be a pathological 
force on the sociological and political 

493
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,430
stage.
So,

494
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,533
as far as I'm concerned,
this is extremely important work and we 

495
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,460
already know from the empirical 
evidence,

496
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,450
strangely enough that it seems to have a
very profound effect on people.

497
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,090
So,
all right,

498
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:11,740
so the other assignment is,
uh,

499
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,030
an essay.
You can write an essay on your choice of

500
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:15,864
topic as long as the topic is related in
some intelligible way to the course 

501
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,064
material,
which really leaves you quite a wide 

502
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:22,494
range of choice.

503
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,490
And it can be a scientific essay,
it can be a philosophical essay,

504
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,640
and it can also be a creative project if
you want to do that.

505
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,460
Although if you choose to do a creative 
project,

506
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,110
then you have to write a commentary on 
it.

507
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,453
So,
so in some sense you have the 

508
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:40,500
opportunity to engage in whatever 
project you'd like to engage in.

509
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:41,610
As long as,
as I said,

510
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,660
it has some relevance to the class.
So there was those three assignments,

511
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:46,494
there's the readings,
and then there's a final exam at the 

512
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:51,360
very end.
And the final exam is multiple choice,

513
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:52,194
strangely enough.
But it's the stick that goes along with 

514
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:55,801
the carrots,
you know,

515
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:59,220
because one of the things I've observed 
in the class is the reading is difficult

516
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,970
and you actually don't have to do it to 
participate in the class.

517
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,130
And so of course people don't do it 
because,

518
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,340
not because they're,
while sometimes because they're lazy and

519
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,174
useless,
but mostly because they prioritize 

520
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:11,904
their,
their time because their time demands 

521
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:17,370
are heavy and things that aren't 
absolutely crucial don't get done.

522
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,680
So the exam makes it crucial.
So if you do the reading you,

523
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,320
you won't have any trouble with the 
exam.

524
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:23,154
But if you don't do the reading,
then you will have trouble with the 

525
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,704
exam.
So I would say do the reading and stay 

526
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,114
caught up because it'll make the course 
richer experience and plus he'll do 

527
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,170
better on the final exam.
So,

528
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,330
so that's basically the outline of the 
course.

529
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,164
Now what I'm going to do is walk you 
through the material fundamentally and 

530
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:43,860
try to explain more deeply why it's 
relevant.

531
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:48,090
And one of my aims in this class,
it's like I'm not a fan of,

532
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,073
of information for information sake.
I think that it's a mistake to pursue 

533
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:55,380
information that isn't relevant.
I mean,

534
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,840
you can pursue it.
If you think it might become relevant in

535
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:58,860
the future,
that's fine.

536
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,390
You know,
that's a calculated risk.

537
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,853
But I don't want to teach you anything 
in this class that you don't find 

538
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:05,424
immediately compelling and useful both 
personally and on the broader social 

539
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,304
stage.
And I think the information that I'm 

540
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,230
going to provide to you,
um,

541
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,980
I think it's absolutely vital.
I do.

542
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,843
I truly do not believe that you can live
properly without knowing what I'm going 

543
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:22,830
to tell you.
And you know,

544
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:23,664
that's kind of,
you might think that's kind of a 

545
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,374
grandiose claim,
but I'm also not trying to take credit 

546
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:30,660
for the content of the information that 
I want to purvey.

547
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,540
You know,
I've spent a long time analyzing,

548
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,080
analyzing the,
the,

549
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,990
the fundamental elements of the great 
stories of the past.

550
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,310
And people are historical creatures and 
unless they're grounded in the past,

551
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:49,600
unless they're grounded in history,
they float up and disappear and it's not

552
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,760
good.
And so you need to know,

553
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:52,594
and especially modern people,
modern people have to understand to 

554
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,674
believe.

555
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,510
And maybe that's fine,
who knows?

556
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:01,240
But we paid a big price for it because 
our,

557
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,403
our demand to understand has made it 
difficult for us to have any faith in 

558
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,024
the sorts of things that human beings 
have believed throughout the entire 

559
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:10,324
course of history.
And that makes modern people in some 

560
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:16,840
sense educated but bereft or 
philosophically week.

561
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,733
And they're often nihilistic or 
ideologically possessed in either of 

562
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:21,574
those two things is those are like 
mental illnesses as far as I'm 

563
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:24,904
concerned.
So I also believe that the material in 

564
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:31,480
the course serves as a vaccination 
against ideological possession.

565
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,793
And I think that ideological possession,
what was certainly the social 

566
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,670
psychopathology that threatened the 
world most in the 20th century,

567
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,671
it'd be nice if we could rid ourselves 
of the tendency to adopt mindless single

568
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:45,664
cause explanations for things and 
confused that with actual education and 

569
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:52,930
wisdom.
So I want to outline to some degree what

570
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:53,764
I think it he ologies are and why 
they're so pernicious and also to 

571
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,384
provide you with what I think of as an 
alternative to ideological thinking 

572
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,400
that's still grounded in what's grounded
in meaning fundamentally.

573
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,583
No.
So,

574
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,883
so anyways,
I thought I was going to tell you that 

575
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,150
after the break,
but I guess that didn't happen.

576
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,130
So,
um,

577
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,980
do you have any questions about that to 
begin with?

578
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:19,330
I cause then I want to tell you this 
story.

579
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:20,164
Yes.

580
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,883
Yeah.

581
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,553
Sorry.

582
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,310
Yeah,

583
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,143
be do it's available now.
All you have to do is go online and you 

584
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,830
can sign up for the,
for the,

585
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,150
for the writing assignments you have to 
generate a username and password.

586
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:38,040
But that's,
if it isn't functional,

587
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:38,874
let me know.
I last time I checked that it was 

588
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,100
functional in it,
you know,

589
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:42,540
it's,
it's pretty reliable.

590
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,690
So,
um,

591
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,020
you can start,
you can start right away.

592
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,180
You just find the website and the way 
you go.

593
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,910
Anything else?
So,

594
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,253
yeah.

595
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,551
Well,
you know,

596
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,384
the next time you have a really intense 
discussion with someone about something 

597
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,040
that's important and just watch what 
happens if you don't quit,

598
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,280
you know,
and you will quit if you're not grounded

599
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:20,550
in what you say firmly and you've 
thought it through like mad,

600
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,384
like what right.
Do you have to impose any suffering on 

601
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:23,874
someone to make a point?
If you don't know what you're talking 

602
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,660
about,
you have no right at all.

603
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,913
So,
and you know there's lots of times when 

604
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,164
you're dealing with people in intimate 
relationships where you have a conflict 

605
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:37,110
of viewpoint and interest and you know 
you can either ignore that,

606
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:40,010
which means you sweep it under the rug,
which is a very thing to do

607
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,053
or you can fight it through and to fight
it through means that you're going to 

608
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:44,834
cause emotional upset in the present.
And people shy away from that and 

609
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,860
rightly so,
you know,

610
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,694
because it can get out of hand.
But the problem was shying away from it 

611
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:55,700
is that it's a small problem right now.
If your eyes are open,

612
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,850
you can see that it's going to develop 
into a large problem in the future.

613
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,220
If you address it now,
it's going to cause conflict,

614
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,370
but it's nothing like the complete hell 
that it'll generate if you let it go.

615
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,893
But then you have to fortify yourself 
property to engage in that kind of 

616
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,470
battle.
And you know,

617
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,020
these sorts of battles that will take 
place throughout your whole life.

618
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
If you want to make,
if you want to have a raise for example,

619
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,280
or if you want to deal with a bully at 
work,

620
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,510
or if you,
you know,

621
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:21,470
any time that your autonomy or your 
freedom is challenged or that your sense

622
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,370
of moral propriety is challenged so that
people are trying to get you to do,

623
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,380
say something that you believe to be 
wrong.

624
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,950
If you're not fortified with,
with arguments like,

625
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,813
like a general in charge of soldiers,
you're just going to get walked all 

626
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:35,990
over.
And that's not a good thing.

627
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:36,824
You know,
it's to be a helpless victim is a bad 

628
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:39,734
destiny and it's,
it's certainly pollutes your psyche to 

629
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:42,674
also be in that situation.
So you want to make yourself into 

630
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:45,884
something that's formidable.
And the way to do that in a civilized 

631
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:52,310
society is to make yourself a master of 
words.

632
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,910
And,
and,

633
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,410
and,
and in the philosophical sense and words

634
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,240
that have meaning and that you're 
behind,

635
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,074
that you're willing to stand for.
And so that it's not the same as say 

636
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:05,300
trying to win an argument.
I mean,

637
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,523
if you're smart and you're dealing with 
someone that you have an intimate 

638
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,550
relationship with,
you never tried to win the argument.

639
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,600
It's like what the Hell is good?

640
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,790
Is that going to do you still have to 
live with the person,

641
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,043
you know,
they'll just take their revenge on you 

642
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:19,430
some way if you win.
So what you want to do is solve the damn

643
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,710
problem,
but that usually takes a bit of a war.

644
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,140
So,
and then you better be ready for a war.

645
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:24,974
You're going to be the loser and maybe 
you're the person you're fighting with 

646
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,970
will be the loser too.
So,

647
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,870
all right,
I want to tell you a story and there's a

648
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,630
bunch of reasons I want to tell you this
story and one is,

649
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:36,464
is because the story illustrates very 
well how unbelievably profound 

650
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,750
archetipal revelations manifest 
themselves in very,

651
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,584
very simple form.
Because I'm going to read you a story 

652
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,154
that's written for four year olds and 
it's a variant of the oldest story that 

653
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,810
humanity has ever told.
And we know that we know what the oldest

654
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:03,080
writings are that we've been able to 
dredge up and translate.

655
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,430
And this is a variant of a story called 
the,

656
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,160
I don't know how to pronounce this 
property.

657
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,353
Um,
the Enuma elish which was a Sumerian 

658
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,250
story from thousands of years ago that 
that's actually quite nicely documented.

659
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,084
We have the tablets and so forth and 
they were discovered in the late 18 

660
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,324
hundreds but it's a,
it's a very intimate hero's story as 

661
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:24,344
well.
And the hero stories are the story of 

662
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,804
human beings.
Fundamentally a hero myth is the story 

663
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,580
of the,
of the individual in society.

664
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,013
And so the reason that hero mythology 
for example is so absolutely potent is 

665
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:40,530
because it provides the grammatical 
structure for,

666
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,423
for,
for understanding your life and laying 

667
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,524
it out in the world.
And so this is a small variant of that 

668
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:46,900
and it,
it's,

669
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,350
it'll give you an idea as we walked 
through it,

670
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,750
how this sort of information is 
transmitted.

671
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,273
It'll give you some indication of how it
is that you understand such information 

672
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,010
even though you don't know that you 
understand it.

673
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,580
Because this story obviously is about 
something completely fictional.

674
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:04,770
One fantastic,
right?

675
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,360
It's,
as you can tell,

676
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:08,580
it's a story about a dragon.
And of course,

677
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:09,414
I mean,
how many of you have watched a movie 

678
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,840
about a dragon in the last year?

679
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,350
Okay.

680
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,210
Yeah.
Is there anybody who hasn't?

681
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,190
Okay.
You haven't,

682
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,270
you haven't.
That's good.

683
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,280
That's amazing that you could actually 
avoid that.

684
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,770
So,
and also,

685
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,001
so,
you know,

686
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:28,550
that's kind of strange because of course
those things don't exist.

687
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:29,384
And so you might ask yourself what,
what accounts for their absolutely 

688
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:36,110
enduring popularity and even their coat 
like popularity.

689
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,810
Cause you see that with,
with,

690
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,653
um,
both in Harry Potter because there's a 

691
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:42,560
dragon in here,
multiple dragons and Harry Potter,

692
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:44,090
right?
In the second volume,

693
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:46,250
there's the basilisk that lives 
underneath the school,

694
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,470
which is a very,
it's a very archetypal idea.

695
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:49,304
And then of course there's the harbor 
and then there's how to train your 

696
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,214
dragon.
And it's like there's dragons in 

697
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,880
sleeping beauty and like there's dragons
everywhere.

698
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:56,714
And of course that's why this boy has 
this problem is that he sees them 

699
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,400
everywhere and people say,
well,

700
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,840
there's no such thing.
So.

701
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,003
Okay.
So,

702
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,180
so we're going to walk through this and 
I'm going to explain to you some of what

703
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,014
it means.

704
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,530
So the first thing that's kind of 
interesting about this illustration,

705
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:16,370
and I don't know if the author Jack 
can't or the illustrator knew this,

706
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:17,204
but if you look at traditional 
representations of this figure called a 

707
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:21,890
neuro burroughs,
which is a,

708
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,070
like in a world in circling serpent,
it's very,

709
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:26,930
very frequent that the thing,
the,

710
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,793
the entity has a twist and its tail.
And from what I've been able to 

711
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,380
understand,
that twist represents infinity.

712
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,510
So the dragon in part is something that 
represents what's beat,

713
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,360
what's continually beyond our realm of 
knowledge.

714
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,110
And so it's a very complicated idea.
And an echo is everywhere.

715
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:45,944
So,
so one thing you can think of is that 

716
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:50,150
there's always something that's beyond 
your realm of knowledge,

717
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,493
your realm of competence and ability.
And another thing that you can think of 

718
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,830
is that people have known this for a 
long time and it's,

719
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:57,664
it's a strange form of knowledge because
it's knowledge about the limits of 

720
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:00,710
knowledge.

721
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,543
So it's like Meta knowledge and,
and you can generalize from that Matt 

722
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,710
and knowledge to some degree because you
can say,

723
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,600
well as you go through your life,
you're going to have a lot of problems.

724
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,570
And then you could also say as you go 
through your life,

725
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,433
a lot of unexpected things will happen 
to you and many of them will be 

726
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:21,050
problems.
And then you can say,

727
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,033
well,
what that means is that you can 

728
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:26,270
conceptualize a class of unexpected 
things,

729
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,493
right?
The class of unexpected things is all 

730
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,490
the potential unexpected things that 
might happen to you.

731
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,980
And then you could say,
well,

732
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,040
how do I deal with an unexpected

733
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
thing?
And the answer to that is you learn how 

734
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,990
as you deal with it,
but you could also ask yourself,

735
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,093
well,
how do I deal with the class of all 

736
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:48,010
unexpected things?
And that's a whole different question.

737
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,820
And I would say in some sense that's a 
primary religious question.

738
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,300
It deals with the fundamental realities 
of,

739
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,233
of life.
There are things outside your domain of 

740
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,160
competence outside of the domain of 
competence of your culture.

741
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,143
And you will have to deal with them.
So how do you deal with them one by one 

742
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,003
or can you deal with them as a class?
And so one of the things that I would 

743
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,350
like to,
um,

744
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,793
offer you as a hypothesis is that 
figures like the dragon are symbolic 

745
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:16,504
representations of the class of all 
things that lie outside of your 

746
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:24,511
competence.
Now you see the figure of the serpent or

747
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,074
the dragon in,
in relationship to a dwelling in very 

748
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:29,560
many stories.

749
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,670
So one story for example,
that this motif comes up in is the story

750
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,504
in Genesis,
the story of Adam and Eve because 

751
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:36,634
there's a serpent in the garden and 
that's exactly the same idea as the 

752
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,594
dragon in the house.
And that's the same idea as the fact 

753
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:44,164
that no matter how hard you try to make 
the environment that you're in stable 

754
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,234
and secure the things that you don't 
understand and don't know how to deal 

755
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,510
with her going to poke their head inside
and,

756
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,120
and emerge.
There's no way of keeping so to speak.

757
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,880
There's no way of keeping the snakes out
of the garden.

758
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,880
So it's a,
it's the wrong approach.

759
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,130
You know,
maybe you could build a fence that's 200

760
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:06,964
feet high and that's drilled a hundred 
feet into the ground that's made out of 

761
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:09,904
solid concrete and put a cap on it and 
sit in the middle of that and not let 

762
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,490
anything in,
in first of all,

763
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,480
that seems like a bad strategy,
but even not,

764
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,314
it doesn't matter because the things 
that you don't understand can emerge 

765
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,660
inside of you as well.

766
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,703
And that happens for example,
every time you get sick or every time 

767
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:26,704
your body does something that you don't 
expect or want it to is there's no 

768
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,174
escape from this situation.
And that's partly what this story is 

769
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,170
about.
So this little boy,

770
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,453
you know,
he's,

771
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,170
he's maturing,
he's growing up,

772
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:42,910
he's becoming self conscious and he's at
an age because he's about three or four,

773
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:43,744
he's,
he's at an age where selfconsciousness 

774
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,970
actually seems to emerge in children 
where they become aware of themselves as

775
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,043
really separate creatures and often 
start to concern themselves with 

776
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,490
covering up,
putting clothes on,

777
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,970
not being naked around other people,
you know,

778
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,290
and some children care about that and 
some don't.

779
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,124
But,
but that is the age approximately that 

780
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,580
it develops.
You know,

781
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,800
so,
so this boy,

782
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,520
he's in his house,
he's in his window and he's become aware

783
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:13,030
of something that's at least perplexing.
Now,

784
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:13,990
you know,
you might say,

785
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:16,750
well given the size of the dragon that 
it's also terrifying,

786
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:17,584
but we'll start with perplexing.
So because what's perplexing can turn 

787
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:25,270
into what's terrifying if you ignore it.
So,

788
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,430
and that's partly what this book is 
trying to present.

789
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,260
It's funny cause it's a cute little 
book,

790
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:32,701
you know,
it's,

791
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,980
it's just a cute little

792
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,510
book.
So,

793
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,120
so there he is.
What sort of facial expression is that?

794
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,900
What do you think?
Surprise.

795
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,011
Yeah.
Okay.

796
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,990
So what happens is,
well the kid wakes up,

797
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,100
do something on his bed.

798
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,480
Yeah.

799
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,020
He's not sure whether he should be 
afraid.

800
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,540
We're interested.
So he sorta both.

801
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,291
He's,
it's like a,

802
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,210
it's like a startle response in some 
sense,

803
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:07,790
but at least it's a focus.
It's a bit of focused attention.

804
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,780
He's discovered something.

805
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,930
Billy bixby

806
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,200
was rather surprised when he woke up one
morning and found a dragon in this room.

807
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,750
It was a small dragon about the size of 
a kitten.

808
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,190
The dragon wagged it's tail happily when
billy padded padded it's head.

809
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,800
Okay,
so well what can we observe about that?

810
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:28,341
Well,
first of all,

811
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:30,860
something unexpected has happened,
right?

812
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,300
And for a little kid that's going to 
capture their imagination,

813
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:33,990
it's like,
Whoa,

814
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,840
you know,
is that scary or,

815
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,840
or you know,
what's billy going to do?

816
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:39,960
And,
and it,

817
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,100
it said narrative hook,
something unexpected has happened.

818
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,941
All right,
but,

819
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:44,774
and it's paradoxical to a,
because it's a dragon and billy is 

820
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,230
surprised,
but it's a small dragon.

821
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,260
It's only the size of a kitten.
And you know,

822
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,490
kittens book,
kids know about Kittens,

823
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,890
they're soft and cuddly and you know,
they've got claws,

824
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:56,810
but they're basically harmless and 
interesting.

825
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,943
And not only that,
when billy interacts with the dragon at 

826
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,110
this size,
it actually wags his tail and is happy.

827
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:03,944
So there's,
there's a paradoxical situation set up 

828
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,480
for the boy right at the beginning of 
the narrative,

829
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:12,920
which is something unexpected happens 
and it has ambivalent significance.

830
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,610
So,
and he's interested in it and he's alert

831
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:19,340
to its possibilities.
But that's about as far as it goes.

832
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,443
So

833
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,380
really does what the logical child would
do.

834
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,340
It's called referencing by the way.
So for example,

835
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,860
if,
if there's a child in a room and I'm,

836
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,270
I was runs by the child,
will orient towards it,

837
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,330
follow it with,
with its size and its head.

838
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:43,700
And then if the parent is around,
then the child will reference the mother

839
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,970
or the father and read off the mother's 
face what the significance of that event

840
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:50,451
was.
You know,

841
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:51,380
because it's,
it's,

842
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:52,214
it's unclassified significance 
intrinsically interesting because it's 

843
00:43:55,851 --> 00:44:00,851
unexpected and fast enough to alert you 
to produce an orienting response so that

844
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:04,190
you attend to it and that it demands 
classification.

845
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,700
So it starts off interesting and even 
potentially upsetting.

846
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
That's how it manifested itself to begin
with.

847
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,090
And then the referencing,
which is the,

848
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,003
the look at the mother's face allows the
child to utilize the wisdom of the 

849
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,210
parent in order to rapidly classified 
the significance of the event.

850
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,280
So then you think,
well,

851
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,570
you know,
the mother says,

852
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,580
oh well it's just a mouse.
We'll take care of it later.

853
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,090
That's one reaction.
The other reaction is,

854
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:29,924
you know,
she jumps up on the table and has a 

855
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,973
screaming fit and then calls the 
hospital could be cause she has a panic 

856
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:36,960
attack.
It's like the meaning of the mouse under

857
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,300
those two circumstances is very much 
different.

858
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,990
You know,
she could also say,

859
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,413
well there aren't any mice here,
which is also a rather pathological 

860
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:49,530
response but perhaps not as bad as the 
full fledged panic attack.

861
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,693
So I mean that's children.
The part of the point of that is that 

862
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,210
when a child encounters something 
unexpected,

863
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,340
so that's outside of their domain of 
competence,

864
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:02,640
it does attract their interest,
the laureate towards it and explore it.

865
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,474
But then they'll use whatever cultural 
information is that at hand to classify 

866
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:11,310
the phenomena so they know what to do in
its presence from then on.

867
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,563
So that,
that's an interesting thing to think 

868
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:14,634
about a,
because there's a couple of things that 

869
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,520
you can think about.
A mouse.

870
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,570
One is what is a mouse,
not like a scientific question.

871
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,140
And the other is if there's a mouse,
what should you do?

872
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,363
And that's not a scientific question.
That's a moral question because it has 

873
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:34,341
to do with behavior and when you're,
it turns out that when you're attempting

874
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,590
to classify a phenomena,
the way that you're set up,

875
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:41,040
given that you're a living creature and 
that you're very much action predicated,

876
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,320
is that when you're trying to classify a
phenomena,

877
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,890
it's implication for behavior is more 
important than its objective nature.

878
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,273
And so almost all the knowledge that you
have that grounds you in the world is 

879
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:56,970
actually information about how to behave
in the presence of things.

880
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:57,923
It's not information about what they are
from an objective perspective and your 

881
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,560
brain is set up that way,
then you're out.

882
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,880
You're very,
very much action oriented peak.

883
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:10,140
Well obviously because you inhabit a 
body that moves and your primary problem

884
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:14,160
in life is what to do with your body as 
you move through space and time.

885
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,950
And that's a particular category of 
knowledge.

886
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,510
I would say that's the category that's 
essentially moral and the the ideas that

887
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:24,720
underlie the essential categories of,
of action,

888
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,790
moral action,
our religious ideas,

889
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:27,624
or at least that's a claim.
So that puts them in a completely 

890
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,940
different category than scientific 
ideas.

891
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:33,774
And it also places them somewhere where 
there's no necessary conflict between 

892
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:40,170
the objective and uh,
and the behavioral.

893
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,393
You have to know how to behave and 
science does not tell you that in fact 

894
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:44,664
it can't.
There's the scientific method is 

895
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:47,784
actually designed so that the 
motivational significance of objects or 

896
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:55,770
entities is stripped off them before the
investigation begins.

897
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,783
You have to treat the phenomena as if 
it's objective and neutral 

898
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:00,534
insignificance and that's fine,
but that doesn't mean that things are 

899
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,600
objective and neutral insignificance.

900
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,553
It just means that for the sake of a 
certain set of processes which are 

901
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:13,200
basically associated with the scientific
method,

902
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,980
you have to undertake that operation 
before you start the game.

903
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,400
And I think it's very pathological turn 
in human history that we've confused the

904
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:27,450
necessity of stripping off the 
significance from something before.

905
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:28,284
You can study it scientifically with the
idea that things have no significance 

906
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:36,040
intrinsically because that's a 
completely debatable point.

907
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,740
It's certainly not how your brain is set
up.

908
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,120
You know,
when you might think,

909
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:43,150
well your brain evolved while that's the
hypothesis.

910
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,650
Anyways,
and you might say,

911
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,290
well,
what did it evolve in relationship to?

912
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,430
And then you might say,
well,

913
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:49,264
it evolved in relationship to reality 
because that's actually how you define 

914
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:55,660
reality.
Especially if you're a Darwinian and the

915
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,494
way your brain reacts to things is that 
it assesses their motivational 

916
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,280
significance first.

917
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,350
So then you might say,
well,

918
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,860
how can you justify the claim that the 
motivational significance isn't real?

919
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,650
And answer as far as I'm concerned is 
you can't,

920
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,940
the motivational significance of 
something might be the most real element

921
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:13,774
of it anyways.
And you certainly act like that even if 

922
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:19,240
you don't believe it technically or or 
rationally.

923
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,193
As you move yourself through the world,
you're constantly evaluating things for 

924
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:27,280
their motivational significance.
And you do that without thinking.

925
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:29,650
It's just how you are.
So,

926
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,890
so that's also we're thinking about,
we'll return to that many times.

927
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,993
Billy,
he went downstairs to his tellers 

928
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:35,734
mother,
there is no such thing as a dragon said 

929
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:40,480
billy's mother.
And she said it like she meant it.

930
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,183
It's like,
well,

931
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,860
yes,
no.

932
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,370
So then you might say,
well you're,

933
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,620
you have a three year old child and they
have the man,

934
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,230
maybe they're having a hard time going 
to sleep cause it's dark and fear of the

935
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,390
dark is actually an emergent phenomena.

936
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,433
So as the child's fear system develops,
as the child becomes more and more 

937
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:00,244
ambulatory and needs to be protected 
from the consequences of wandering off 

938
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,390
unattended,
the fiercest does also come online.

939
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,523
And what do they do?
They populate the darkness with 

940
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,464
monsters.
Now you might say you go into your 

941
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,490
child's room and you might say,
and they say,

942
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:16,324
well,
you know there's a monster in the dark 

943
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,491
and you say,
well,

944
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:19,324
there's no such thing as monsters.
And then you think really there's no 

945
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:26,190
such thing as monsters.
You know?

946
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,033
That's why people are terrified to let 
their children walk three blocks to 

947
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:33,190
school because there's no such thing as 
monsters.

948
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,280
It's like there are plenty of monsters 
and you might say,

949
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:40,810
well there aren't monsters like dragons.
And then I might say,

950
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,270
well what makes you show so sure of 
that?

951
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,970
Why is that a bad classification 
heading?

952
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,450
You know,
if you're talking about the class of all

953
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,180
dangerous things that lurk in the 
darkness,

954
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,014
let's say,
because that is a good place for the 

955
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:55,084
class of all dangerous things to lurk.
How better to represent it than in 

956
00:49:58,181 --> 00:49:59,014
monstrous forum because the monstrous 
form takes pieces from all of the 

957
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:06,940
potential dangers and amalgamates them 
into a single danger and says,

958
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,133
look out,
wander into the domains that you don't 

959
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:15,010
understand at your apparel.
Well that's not fake.

960
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,930
It's not false.
It's real.

961
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,243
You know,
and children are small and edible and 

962
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,300
they've been that way throughout 
history.

963
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,330
And you know,
people who children who wandered too far

964
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:28,490
away from the campfire,
we're going to get hurt.

965
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,180
And so the idea that there are dragons,
for example,

966
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:34,310
there aren't monsters.
That's not a good idea.

967
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,020
It's not the right approach.

968
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,760
I remember once,
this may only seem peripherally related,

969
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:44,730
but it's actually,
it's an integrity related.

970
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,940
One time I remember my daughter when she
was about three or there about,

971
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:51,264
she came to talk to my wife and I in the
morning and she said she had a 

972
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:55,434
nightmare.
And the nightmare was she'd seen this 

973
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,430
clear stream running through,
it sounds like an environmentalist fairy

974
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:01,264
tale.
She saw this clear stream running 

975
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:04,440
through a forest and there was garbage 
in it.

976
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,450
And when she saw the garbage in it,
you know,

977
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:07,284
she was upset about it.
And then she came into our room and she 

978
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,730
said that this was upsetting and that 
why was their garbage in the stream?

979
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,790
And one response to that is,
you know,

980
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:16,620
don't worry about it.
It was just a dream.

981
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,480
And the other response is,
well,

982
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:21,150
what would you do if you came upon a 
situation like that?

983
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,460
And so we asked her that and she said,
well,

984
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:25,470
maybe I could take the garbage out of 
the stream.

985
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:26,281
And so I said,
well,

986
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:28,170
you just close your eyes and just 
imagine that,

987
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:29,303
you know,
you take the garbage out of the stream 

988
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:31,194
and maybe you go put it in the garbage 
can and then that's the end of the 

989
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:35,880
problem.
So she was quite happy with that.

990
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:37,620
And then she wandered off and went back 
to sleep.

991
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:38,454
And that's,
that's a better answer than that was 

992
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:42,090
just a dream,
you know.

993
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:42,924
And,
and I don't exactly know what you mean 

994
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:45,860
when you say that was just a dream 
anyway.

995
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:47,880
It's like,
what the hell do you know about dreams?

996
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,063
You know?
I mean,

997
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,033
really everything in the world emerges 
as a dream and you don't understand 

998
00:51:53,671 --> 00:51:55,860
dreams at all.
You go to sleep and they happen to you.

999
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,770
You don't control them.
They're phenomena of nature.

1000
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,680
So what are you going to say?
That was nothing.

1001
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:02,551
It's like,
yeah,

1002
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:04,020
sure.
It's not nothing.

1003
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,370
Well,
that's her position.

1004
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,390
Billy went downstairs to tell his mother
there's no such thing as a dragon,

1005
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:12,150
said billy's mother,
and she said it like she meant it.

1006
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,673
That's a person who does not want to 
admit to the existence of chaos and 

1007
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,580
disorder or who wants to protect your 
child from that.

1008
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:21,743
And you know,
there's some utility in that because 

1009
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:27,960
there's children have a limited capacity
to deal with chaos and disorder,

1010
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,730
but to deny its existence in their 
presence is the wrong thing to do.

1011
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,803
First of all,
you give them the wrong idea about the 

1012
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:38,100
nature of the world.
Second,

1013
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,053
you're implicitly telling the child that
there are certain elements of reality 

1014
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:42,864
that they have that have to be hidden 
from them because they're either so 

1015
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:46,164
overwhelming that no one can deal with 
them or that the child is so useless 

1016
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:50,244
that the child can't deal with them.
That's not the right message to give 

1017
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:57,270
your children.
The right message is there are dragons,

1018
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,463
but if you're careful,
you can learn how to deal with them and 

1019
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:01,434
we'll help.
So it's like Eda pulled mother mistake 

1020
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:06,114
number one.

1021
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,860
Kelly went back to his room and began to
dress the dragon came close to billy and

1022
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:19,550
wag its tail.
So it's looking for attention,

1023
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,384
right?
There's something in the household 

1024
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:24,860
that's looking for attention and people 
are ignoring it.

1025
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,913
Now,
if I don't know how many households 

1026
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,400
you've walked into where that's the 
case,

1027
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,720
I mean,
I dunno,

1028
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,273
it's endemic among households where 
there's a number of things that are 

1029
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:38,640
demanding attention and no one's paying 
attention to them.

1030
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,410
There are things that you don't talk 
about.

1031
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:43,560
Are there things that you have to 
pretend not to notice?

1032
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:44,394
And everyone walks around on eggshells 
or on the elephants underneath the 

1033
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:48,384
carpet pretending that everything's all 
right and there's nothing that's all 

1034
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:51,684
right in the household at all.
And so people in this situation like 

1035
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:57,990
that or denying the reality of their 
own,

1036
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,690
not of their own senses,
but if something even deeper than that,

1037
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:01,524
they're denying the reality of the 
importance that their own nervous 

1038
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,240
systems are signaling to them 
constantly.

1039
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:08,580
It's something's up here.
Something's up here.

1040
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,460
Something's not good.
It should be attended to.

1041
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:11,971
It's like,
no,

1042
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:15,150
everything's okay.
We don't talk about that sort of thing.

1043
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,040
It's like,
that won't make it go away.

1044
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,520
Billy went back to his room and began to
dress the dragon,

1045
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,410
came close to billy and wagged it's 
tail.

1046
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,240
But Billy didn't pat it.
If there's no such thing as something,

1047
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:31,010
it's silly to patted on its head.
It's reasonable proposition.

1048
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,690
Billy washed his face and hands and went
down to breakfast.

1049
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,030
The dragon went along.
It was almost,

1050
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,310
it was bigger now,
almost the size of a dog.

1051
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,690
Well,
so that's interesting.

1052
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:48,100
So for some reason the dragon is now 
growing now,

1053
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,943
we don't really know why it's growing.
So that's another mystery that's popped 

1054
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,950
up in the middle of the narrative.
You know,

1055
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:57,380
we might infer,
while we won't infer anything,

1056
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,500
it's foreshadowing the fact that the 
dragon is growing in the idea there,

1057
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:01,334
there's something like a hint of an idea
that if something surprising attracts 

1058
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:07,280
your attention and you don't attend to 
it,

1059
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,380
then it has the probability of expanding
in size.

1060
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,900
And that's a very interesting thing,
that idea.

1061
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:19,901
So I can give you an example of how that
sort of thing can occur in your own life

1062
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:25,040
and how your senses blind you to the 
reality of things.

1063
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:30,710
So let's say you get a bill from the tax
department and they say,

1064
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:31,544
well,
you owe us $79 and 47 cents and so you 

1065
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:35,660
think,
well what is that?

1066
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,200
Well that's a piece of paper.
That's what you have in front of you,

1067
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:41,720
a piece of paper.
So you crumple it up and you throw it in

1068
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:42,554
the garbage.
And so then a month later you get 

1069
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:50,540
another bill and it's like $95 and it's 
a little bit more insistent.

1070
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:54,140
And so you crumple that up and you throw
it in the garbage and you continue to do

1071
00:55:54,141 --> 00:55:54,974
this.
And what happens is that little thing 

1072
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:58,580
that you're ignoring is going to 
aggregate

1073
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,010
monstrous qualities across time.
And if you leave it long enough,

1074
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,083
then it's going to be something that 
you're really going to have to contend 

1075
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:07,934
with.
Like maybe it's something that destroys 

1076
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:11,840
your credit history so that you don't 
get to have a mortgage on your house the

1077
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,400
first time that you tried to buy a 
house,

1078
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,830
you know,
or maybe you get tangled up with the tax

1079
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,664
department and they audit every income 
tax return you do for the rest of your 

1080
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,160
life,
which would make you miserable for about

1081
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,970
a month,
a year on a basis for the next 50 years.

1082
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,140
So it's,
it's a strange thing because you know,

1083
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:29,974
your,
your census seemed to be designed to 

1084
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:36,370
tell you what's immediately relevant in 
this immediate space right now,

1085
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:39,280
here and now.
And so you see things a certain way,

1086
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:44,281
but they're not really that way and lots
of things that seem relatively innocuous

1087
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,904
from an objective perspective have the 
capability of manifesting themselves in 

1088
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:52,714
magnified proportions across time and 
all you have to do in order to allow to 

1089
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:59,050
have that happen is just do nothing.

1090
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,900
They'll grow of their own accord.
If you don't attend to them,

1091
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,273
and pretty much all the real problems 
that you'll face in your life are going 

1092
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,244
to be like that.
There'll be things in your 

1093
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,140
relationships,
for example,

1094
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:08,974
that you think,
well,

1095
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,200
I don't really have to attend to that.
It's like,

1096
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,520
fine,
you know,

1097
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:13,354
don't attend to it once you've been 
alerted to its existence and see what 

1098
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:18,610
happens when that's what this book is 
about,

1099
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,800
so it's bigger now.
Both the size of a dog,

1100
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,663
still not too bad.
It's a dog you could deal with that 

1101
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,420
probably barely sat down at the table.
The dragon sat down on the table.

1102
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,120
This sort of thing was not usually 
permitted,

1103
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,690
but there wasn't much billy's mother 
could do about it.

1104
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,570
She'd already said there was no such 
thing as a dragon.

1105
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,073
And if there is no such thing,
you can't tell it to get down off the 

1106
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:45,864
table.
I like this scene for a variety of 

1107
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,140
reasons.
One of the reasons I like it is because

1108
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,650
if you watch parents with their young 
children,

1109
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,640
one of the places that there's terrible 
conflict around is eating.

1110
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:12,030
Many children are somewhat neil phobic.
They don't like new things,

1111
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,770
or at least they tell you that they 
don't like them.

1112
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,590
And many children are also quite 
disagreeable,

1113
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,453
you know,
so children vary in their temperament 

1114
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,703
and there are some children who will do 
everything they possibly can to please 

1115
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:23,730
you.
And they're pretty,

1116
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:24,564
you know,
they're easy children to take care of 

1117
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,440
all the,
they have their own sets of problems.

1118
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,743
Um,
and then there are other children who 

1119
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:33,930
are very disagreeable and there are 
fundamental proposition.

1120
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,823
Position in life is no,
and that usually emerges at about the 

1121
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:39,420
age of two.
Right.

1122
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:42,930
And that's when children discover no,
and it's the magic word,

1123
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,793
you know,
because parents tell them that please 

1124
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:45,660
and thank you are the magic words.

1125
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,060
And that's wrong.
No is the magic word.

1126
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,370
Because what know is,
is a test case.

1127
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:51,240
It's like,
all right,

1128
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,313
where do I end and where do you begin?
And the way I discovered that as by you 

1129
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:56,340
asked me something,
I say,

1130
00:58:56,341 --> 00:58:58,170
no,
my son was like that.

1131
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,423
He was,
he was hilarious as a two year old 

1132
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:03,690
because like everything you asked him 
was no.

1133
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,650
So I'd ask him a bunch of things that I 
knew he didn't want to walk,

1134
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,800
do you know?
And he'd say,

1135
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:08,400
no,
no,

1136
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,420
no.
Then I'd say,

1137
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,254
well,
how would you like some chocolate ice 

1138
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:11,814
cream?
And then he was really on the road by 

1139
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:14,310
then and he'd say,
well no.

1140
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,640
And then you know,
he'd think about it and realize that,

1141
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,833
you know,
he just passed up an opportunity for 

1142
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:20,754
chocolate ice cream.
And so that was a good trick to play on 

1143
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:24,110
a two year old as far as I was 
concerned.

1144
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,730
Yeah.
So,

1145
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,390
but no is a really important word and 
it's,

1146
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:29,224
it's uh,
it's the place of the battleground 

1147
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,750
between the child.
It's a Friday and idea in some sense.

1148
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:36,290
Although Freud identified this conflict 
more with toilet training,

1149
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,900
which is also a place where terrible 
conflicts can emerge.

1150
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,363
I knew a family who had a daughter who 
would only use the toilet if she had a 

1151
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:47,690
diaper on.
Now that's,

1152
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,540
that's defiant man.
You know,

1153
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,170
she had full control over her system,
but there's no damn way she was going to

1154
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:55,004
do what her mother wanted her to do.
She had to put a diaper on and then she 

1155
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,300
would go to the toilet.
So yes,

1156
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,270
there was like a year's worth of warfare
around that.

1157
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:03,104
I can tell you,
but you see the same thing at tables 

1158
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:08,270
with kids because people have a real 
hard time,

1159
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,890
and I don't know if it's always been 
like this,

1160
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:13,400
but modern people have a terrible time 
trying to get their children to eat,

1161
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,443
you know,
cause they're possessed by stupid ideas 

1162
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,211
like,
well,

1163
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:17,810
the child will eat what's good for them.

1164
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,850
It's like that's,
do you,

1165
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,400
why would you expect a two year old to 
do that?

1166
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,740
You know,
who the hell eats what's good for them?

1167
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,800
It's like Chocolatey.
Claire's had milkshakes for lunch.

1168
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:28,634
You know,
that's the right thing to do and 

1169
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,373
children aren't stupid.
Or maybe they'll just eat hot dogs and 

1170
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:34,610
nothing else or maybe hot dogs and kraft
dinner.

1171
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,473
That's all they ever wants.
Like you let your kid get away with 

1172
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:38,144
that.
Well what do you do then they're going 

1173
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,234
to grow up to be someone who isn't smart
enough to enjoy food that's not that 

1174
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:45,734
helpful.
It's like there's about six things in 

1175
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,120
life that are intrinsically pleasurable 
and eating is one of them.

1176
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,223
So you know,
you can warp them pretty nicely when 

1177
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:56,510
they're little about what they're going 
to be allowed to eat and what not.

1178
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:57,344
And you know,
you deny them a whole lifetime of 

1179
01:00:58,761 --> 01:00:59,594
pleasure,
the pleasure that can be involved in 

1180
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,830
exploring new foods and eating new 
cuisines and all of that.

1181
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,980
But with,
especially with little monster children,

1182
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,210
you know,
getting their,

1183
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,850
getting their eating habits straight is 
no joke.

1184
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:13,100
You have to have rules.
There has to be consistency,

1185
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:16,100
there has to be disciplined and there 
has to be orderly timing.

1186
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,650
You know,
cause the kid is also trying to organize

1187
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,484
their,
their bodies are trying to organize 

1188
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,410
themselves with relationship to,
you know,

1189
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,253
the rhythms of the day with sleeping and
waking and eating and all those things 

1190
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:30,410
that are the basic basic elements of,
of,

1191
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,293
of a fundamentally healthy existence.
And trying to get a child to be in tune 

1192
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:39,560
with some sort of stable rhythm for some
children's is extremely difficult.

1193
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,940
I've had clients who's sleeping and 
eating was chronically disregulated.

1194
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,133
So which basically meant that for their 
whole life they never ate properly and 

1195
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,020
they never slept properly.
They never learned how to do it.

1196
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:56,540
And it's partly because this little 
battle here never occurred.

1197
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,270
It's like there is a dragon at the 
table.

1198
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,673
That's partly why it's so important to 
have your family around the table on a 

1199
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:03,614
fairly regular basis because you know,
that's a fundamental place where the 

1200
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:08,600
individual meets society,
human being,

1201
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:09,980
share food.
It's like,

1202
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:10,814
that's weird.
There aren't any other animals that do 

1203
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:14,000
that except fundamentally,
you know,

1204
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:15,740
from mother to,
to pop.

1205
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,933
But human beings share food and it's 
really built into our systems at a deep 

1206
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:20,930
level.
You know,

1207
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,270
I noticed with my daughter who was,
who was quite agreeable,

1208
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,480
at least when she was young,
um,

1209
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,400
I used to play tricks on her too.
So,

1210
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:30,234
you know,
when she was at the table and she was 

1211
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:34,950
about 18 months old or so,
maybe you should have some dessert.

1212
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,040
And then I'd ask her if I could have it 
and she'd give it to me right away,

1213
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:40,320
which of course made me feel horribly 
guilty.

1214
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,830
It's like stealing candy from a baby.
I felt like Mr.

1215
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,400
Burns,
you know,

1216
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,233
so,
but she'd handed to me right away and 

1217
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:47,754
with a smile on her face,
which I thought was absolutely 

1218
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:50,370
remarkable,
you know?

1219
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:51,204
And,
and it was curious to see that that was 

1220
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:54,810
built in as an instinct at such an early
age.

1221
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,850
By the time she was three,
you know,

1222
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:57,684
this kid's age,
there's no damn way she's going to hand 

1223
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,420
me her dessert.
You know,

1224
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:01,254
cause it was at that point,
I think somewhere around that point 

1225
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:03,810
that,
that,

1226
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,363
you know,
she had started to conceptualize 

1227
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,134
yourself more as an individual.
And that initial instinct that was a 

1228
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:12,260
sharing instinct had vanished,
you know,

1229
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,880
then you have to kind of socialize it 
back into place.

1230
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,320
But anyways,
there's plenty of dragons at the table,

1231
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,000
you know,
and you'll see that too.

1232
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,950
Sometimes you go out to restaurants and 
you know,

1233
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:23,784
there'll be a family there with,
with their two year old or two and a 

1234
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:26,580
half year old.

1235
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,290
And the thing is like completely out of 
control.

1236
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,124
You know,
it's like a cat with a clothes pin on 

1237
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:32,064
its tail running around the cafe or 
restaurant doing nothing but causing 

1238
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,360
trouble.
And you know,

1239
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,910
the thing about,
I had a client once who,

1240
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,990
who was very immature man,
but he,

1241
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:43,410
he had had a child and he wanted to sort
of,

1242
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,323
you know,
wake up a bit and try to be a civilized 

1243
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:49,200
human being and not to screw up this kid
too terribly.

1244
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,034
And he had this dream that um,
the crib for the baby was by the window 

1245
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:59,031
and that a bolt of lightening had struck
inside the window and let,

1246
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,700
let a ball of lightening go in the House
and it was tearing all over the place.

1247
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:04,130
You know,
and I thought when,

1248
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,000
when I discussed the dream with him,
I thought,

1249
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:06,760
well,
you know,

1250
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,640
the dreams telling you about children's 
let,

1251
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,500
there's a powerful potential inside of 
them.

1252
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,300
But unless it's socialized properly and 
integrated properly into culture,

1253
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:17,400
then it can be a terrible destructive 
force.

1254
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,900
And,
and there's,

1255
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,550
you know,
there's little doubt about that.

1256
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,830
So,
well,

1257
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:24,810
anyways,
it doesn't matter because billy's mother

1258
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:27,780
has already decided that there's no such
thing as a dragon at the table.

1259
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,240
And you know,
that means that when she takes her child

1260
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,380
to a restaurant or to a dinner and it 
misbehaves terribly,

1261
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,543
that the child will continually 
encounter nothing but fake smiles and 

1262
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,250
disapproval from all the adults that are
around it.

1263
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,490
And that's going to be it's destiny for 
the next number of years.

1264
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,391
And so,
you know,

1265
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:48,420
if you want to do something particularly
evil and vicious to your child,

1266
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:49,254
then made sure that you fail to inform 
them of any of the basic rules of 

1267
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:54,920
civilized behavior so that everywhere 
they go,

1268
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,763
the adults can pretend to tolerate them 
and then really be pleased when they 

1269
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,710
leave and never invite them back.

1270
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,300
Uh,
it's a great destiny.

1271
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,720
So mother made some pancakes for billy,
but the drag and ate them all,

1272
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,140
mother made some more.
But the dragon,

1273
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:22,930
those two mother kept making pancakes 
until she ran out of batter.

1274
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:26,890
Billy only got one of them,
but he said that's all he really wanted.

1275
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:27,724
Anyway.
So I'll tell you another story about 

1276
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:33,910
that.
So when I lived in Boston,

1277
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,283
I had little kids and my wife took care 
of some neighborhood little kids cause 

1278
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:41,980
she didn't have a green card and that 
was,

1279
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,710
she was home with the kids anyway.
So anyway,

1280
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:47,680
she took care of some other little kids.
One of them would only eat hot dogs.

1281
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:50,200
That was quite funny.
You'd only eat hotdogs that his mother's

1282
01:05:50,201 --> 01:05:53,230
place.
But at our house he had all of his lunch

1283
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:55,930
and he was perfectly happy about it.
So I thought that was quite amusing too.

1284
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:56,763
But anyways,
one day a neighbor came by and the 

1285
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:02,794
neighbor had a four year old child and 
the neighbor was looking for someone to 

1286
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:07,354
take care of the child because her nanny
had been in a car accident and couldn't 

1287
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:11,224
take care of the child temporarily.
So the child had sort of been 

1288
01:06:13,391 --> 01:06:16,770
circulating around neighborhood houses 
for a couple of days and you know,

1289
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,990
people were taking care of him.
Then he ended up at our house and um,

1290
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,600
which was fine.
And so he's a cute little guy.

1291
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:23,853
And,
uh,

1292
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,710
his,
the mother came to the door and she said

1293
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,443
she,
you know,

1294
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,020
push the boy and he was kind of like 
this.

1295
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,160
It wasn't very happy.
And,

1296
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:37,570
um,
she said he probably won't eat all day,

1297
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:40,030
but that's okay.
And I thought,

1298
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,273
hmm,
that's a,

1299
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,920
that's a remarkably interesting 
statement to,

1300
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,030
you know,
to,

1301
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:48,100
to put forth as a proposition.

1302
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:52,720
The first time we meet your son,
it's like he won't eat all day,

1303
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,250
which by the way,
is not okay.

1304
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,233
It's not okay and you're going to tell 
us that it's okay and you're going to 

1305
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:00,880
expect that.
We're just going to accept the fact that

1306
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:02,380
you think it's okay.
And that's,

1307
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,243
that's the whole story.
You deliver all that information in one 

1308
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,820
little sentence.
So I thought,

1309
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:08,990
well that's pretty damn peculiar.
Uh,

1310
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,800
I believe she was a psychologist too,
which was quite interesting.

1311
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,060
So,
okay,

1312
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:13,894
so that's fine.
So I went out to do something and there 

1313
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:17,554
was four kids playing in the house and 
when I came back the little guy was in 

1314
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:20,914
the porch,
like wear the boots were at everything 

1315
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:26,020
and he was sort of standing there like 
this and I thought,

1316
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:26,883
hmm,
that's not good because there's all 

1317
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:30,220
these other kids,
like he should've been in there playing.

1318
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,730
Hey that obviously that,
that's what a child is prime to do.

1319
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:36,670
He should've been in there messing about
with,

1320
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:37,504
I think there was a two year old and 
three year old and another four year 

1321
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,000
old.
He should have beaten there,

1322
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:40,863
you know,
causing trouble and having fun and 

1323
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:43,120
playing.
But he wasn't,

1324
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:46,000
he was standing in the porch like this 
and he wasn't happy.

1325
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,863
He wasn't happy.
So I looked at him for a bit and then I 

1326
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:51,550
poked them a couple of times because I 
thought,

1327
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,680
you know,
if you're interacting with little kids,

1328
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:54,640
they're very playful,
a,

1329
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:56,740
they're kind of like puppies.
And so if you,

1330
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,020
if you tease them a bit and tickled him 
a bath,

1331
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,270
then usually even if they're crabby,
you know,

1332
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,253
a smile,
a breakout that despite their best 

1333
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:06,010
efforts and then they'll sort of giggle 
and maybe,

1334
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:07,900
you know,
they'll try to whack you away and they,

1335
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:08,470
you know,
they,

1336
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,210
they go into a play routine.

1337
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,660
And although you may not know what 
mammals like us have a place and also,

1338
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:17,914
so we're intrinsically playful,
which is partly why we can get along 

1339
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:20,684
with dogs because of course dogs are 
intrinsically playful and most people 

1340
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:25,280
know how to play with the dog.
And you know,

1341
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,690
when a dog wants to play,
right,

1342
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:27,524
because it sort of puts his paws down 
and looks up at you and sort of grands 

1343
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:32,510
and puts its tail in the air and goes 
like Das.

1344
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:35,150
It's like clue in primate,
you know,

1345
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,420
it's time to engage in some playing and 
you know,

1346
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:41,510
you basically know how to do that.
And even the dog knows how to do that.

1347
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:44,660
So I'm poking this kid and trying to get
him to smile,

1348
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,190
but there's no damn way,
you know,

1349
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:48,680
I'm poking him.
He's just ignoring me like mad.

1350
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,270
And I thought that's not good.

1351
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,103
You know,
because you don't want your four year 

1352
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:54,680
old to have learned that you should.
You should.

1353
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,920
That it's okay to ignore adults or that 
you should ignore adults or that you can

1354
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:00,914
ignore adults.
That's all bad because the world's full 

1355
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:04,184
of adults and they know a lot of things 
and they control all the resources and 

1356
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:08,024
so you better get along with them.
Plus you're going to end up as an adult 

1357
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:14,660
for most of your life.
So if the general,

1358
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:15,494
you know,
if the first rule is adults can and 

1359
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:21,650
should be ignored,
then what the hell are you headed for?

1360
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,484
You know,
and it's one of the reasons that it's 

1361
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:24,464
really useful to make sure the children 
respect adults because they're going to 

1362
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:29,960
be adults.
So if they don't respect adults,

1363
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:33,020
then of course they don't have any 
respect for what they're going to be.

1364
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,190
Why the hell grow up?
You end up like Peter Pan Because that's

1365
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:38,420
what Peter Parents about,
right?

1366
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,860
Peter Pan Wants to stay at Neverland 
with the lost boys where,

1367
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:45,080
where there's no responsibility because 
you know,

1368
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,003
he looks at the future and only sees his
captain hook a tyrant who's afraid of 

1369
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,600
death.
That's the crocodile,

1370
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:51,434
right?
That's chasing him with a clock in its 

1371
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,040
stomach.
And it's the same thing as this dragon.

1372
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,250
So you know,
kids have to respect adults.

1373
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:00,200
It's you doing them a disservice if they
don't.

1374
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,311
So,
okay,

1375
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:02,660
so fine,
I'm poking this kid.

1376
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:04,790
There's just no damn way.
I'm not getting anywhere with them.

1377
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:07,640
And I thought this isn't good.
There's something deeply wrong with this

1378
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:09,410
little kid.
So that's fine.

1379
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,244
So then we sit all the kids down for 
lunch and the rule is you're damn lunch 

1380
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:18,350
and be thankful for it because you think
about this,

1381
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,184
there's,
Leonard Cohen wrote this song once 

1382
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:22,580
about,
I don't remember the song particularly,

1383
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:26,060
but he talked about the homicidal 
bitching that goes down in every kitchen

1384
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:28,190
about who is going to serve and who's 
going to eat.

1385
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,400
It's like if you haven't encountered 
that,

1386
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,470
then there's something terribly wrong.
You know,

1387
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,540
so because a lot of the tension in 
households is domestic tension,

1388
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,000
the tension between husbands and wives 
or husbands,

1389
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:41,834
wives and children.
It's like just who the hell is going to 

1390
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:47,780
do the domestic duties and how and when,
and the answer can't be,

1391
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:48,614
well,
we're not going to do them because then 

1392
01:10:49,731 --> 01:10:52,670
you know,
you eat cheetos and popcorn and you know

1393
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,070
for the rest of your life and that's not
good.

1394
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:55,904
It's got to the point in England because
the domestic situations have 

1395
01:10:58,941 --> 01:10:59,774
deteriorated.
The rituals of deteriorated to such a 

1396
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,324
point that about one third at families 
no longer have a dining room table and 

1397
01:11:05,781 --> 01:11:09,950
you can buy precooked hard boiled eggs.
Yeah,

1398
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:10,850
yeah,
right.

1399
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:11,361
You know,
it's,

1400
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:13,680
it's not a good thing and you might 
yourself,

1401
01:11:13,681 --> 01:11:16,740
why the hell everyone is either fat or 
has an eating disorder.

1402
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,170
And you know,
part of the reason is is that the entire

1403
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:23,100
domestic routine around regulating food 
intake has disappeared.

1404
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,850
That's a terrible thing for people 
because we're social eaters.

1405
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,410
So you might say,
well,

1406
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,770
if you sit down with a bunch of other 
people at a table,

1407
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:32,663
how much should you eat?
And the answer is you should eat on 

1408
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,750
average what everyone else eats.
And that's exactly what you do.

1409
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:41,670
Even if you don't notice it,
you know,

1410
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:45,420
people are so wired into,
we did experiments like this.

1411
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,800
If you,
if you bring on,

1412
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,013
or if you bring undergraduates who don't
know each other into a lab and you give 

1413
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,910
them a snack while they're doing 
something like watching a movie,

1414
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:57,510
they will eat the same number of chips.
So you know,

1415
01:11:57,511 --> 01:12:00,420
if one of the meets the whole half the 
thing,

1416
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:02,430
the other real you'd have if one only 
has one,

1417
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:03,510
the other only have one.

1418
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,280
The correlation between the food intake 
between the dyads was about 0.8

1419
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,323
it was staggering.
It seemed to be a little higher for 

1420
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:14,010
extroverts than for introverts,
but it was remarkably,

1421
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,350
remarkably can coordinate.
You can understand why,

1422
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:17,880
right?
Because human beings share food.

1423
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:22,881
It's like you are not going to be a 
popular tribes person if you eat,

1424
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:23,934
you know,
30% of the food when food is in short 

1425
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,930
supply,
you better be bloody awake and make sure

1426
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,520
that you don't take more than your 
share.

1427
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,593
And you know,
it's a fundamental element of human 

1428
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,250
nature to do that.
And you know,

1429
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:39,260
and we also regulate our sense of 
satiety by cues that are external to us.

1430
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,153
So regulating our food intake also 
because we're omnivores turns out to be 

1431
01:12:43,801 --> 01:12:46,110
a tremendously difficult thing.
And well,

1432
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,120
anyways,
back to this kid.

1433
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:48,983
So we bring all the kids to the table 
and they're sitting around in there 

1434
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,340
having lunch.

1435
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,460
And the rule is,
as I said,

1436
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,420
eat what is in front of you and be 
pleased and happy about it.

1437
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,580
So you might say,
well why would that also be a rule?

1438
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:03,414
It's like,
okay,

1439
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:07,260
put yourself in this position now 
because you'll be in this position.

1440
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:12,090
You're going to cook your damn kids some
lunch and you're going to do that.

1441
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,860
Well let's,
let's calculate it out.

1442
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,060
Cause I liked doing arithmetic.
So let's say it takes you half an hour a

1443
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:18,894
day and you do it seven days a week.
But we'll multiply that by three cause 

1444
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,790
there's three meals.
So it's an hour and a half a day,

1445
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,900
right?
So,

1446
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,734
okay fine.
Seven times an hour and a half has 

1447
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:30,600
roughly 10 so it's 10 hours a week.
It's 40 hours a month,

1448
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:32,620
right?
40 hours a month is a full work week.

1449
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:36,960
So 40 hours a month times 1212 full work
weeks,

1450
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,490
right?
Yes.

1451
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,520
That's three full months of 40 hour days
of cooking something for your damn kid.

1452
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,113
Now that's a lot of time.
And then you're going to do that for 18 

1453
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:48,960
years.
So then you might ask yourself,

1454
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,453
what sort of response do you need from 
your child in order to not feel 

1455
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:56,664
resentful and miserable about the fact 
that you have to do that for three 

1456
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:03,300
bloody months this year.
And you just have to think about this.

1457
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,313
And this is also why it's necessary to 
know that inside yourself you carry a 

1458
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:08,664
monster.
Just like the world outside you carries 

1459
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:10,884
a monster.
Do not think that you're going to be 

1460
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:13,264
able to maintain a healthy attitude 
towards your child or towards food or 

1461
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:17,974
towards yourself.
If all you can muster up for the effort 

1462
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:21,784
of cooking and preparing food is the 
attitude of a slave and continual 

1463
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,280
punishment from the people that you're 
offering food too.

1464
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,170
It's like,
who the hell wants that?

1465
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,573
So you want to teach the miserable 
little lighter that he's lucky that 

1466
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:34,690
there's any food there at all.

1467
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,523
And that the proper attitude is to say,
really thank you very much mom or thank 

1468
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:39,334
you very much dad.
I'm glad that you produce something and 

1469
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,570
then you know,
you can be all happy about the fact that

1470
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:44,200
you were,
you know,

1471
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,840
slaving away in the kitchen and you can 
like your kid.

1472
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,401
So,
and you know,

1473
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,200
you might think,
well everybody likes their kids.

1474
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:50,801
It's like,
yeah,

1475
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:53,470
right.
No that's not true.

1476
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,830
That's not true.
And now,

1477
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:55,331
and then,
you know,

1478
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,190
you read in the newspaper about someone 
who's,

1479
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:58,263
you know,
being pushed a little bit too far on 

1480
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:02,950
some day that they're unemployed and 
hung over and you know,

1481
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:03,784
the relationship has just broken up and 
they do something absolutely brutal to 

1482
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:07,180
their child.
And you think,

1483
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,470
well,
how could anyone do that?

1484
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:13,500
It's like there's a lot of history of 
terrible interactions between the mother

1485
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:14,704
and the child or the father and the 
child before something like that 

1486
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:17,110
happens.

1487
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,591
So,
you know,

1488
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:20,890
if you want to protect your child 
against the beast that's inside you,

1489
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,993
you might want to teach them to treat 
you with some respect so that you're 

1490
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:26,890
much more likely to be a civilized human
being around them.

1491
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,960
So,
all right,

1492
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:31,600
so anyway,
so this kid sitting there and there's no

1493
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,350
damn way he's going to eat anything.
Okay?

1494
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,780
So we decided we're going to feed him,
which I'm an expert at because my,

1495
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,910
my son,
the one who said no all the time,

1496
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,790
he was the most stubborn little cus you 
could possibly imagine.

1497
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,280
And one time when he was about nine 
months old,

1498
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:49,150
he got ahold of the spoon and it was 
like he was not going to be fed anymore.

1499
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:50,140
Hey.
So that's fine.

1500
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:50,591
Good.
You know,

1501
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:51,424
it's like feed yourself but no kids a,
they're too damn curious and playful 

1502
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:56,260
really to feed themselves.

1503
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,540
So you sit them in a high chair and then
you know,

1504
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:01,360
they fleeing the food onto the floor 
cause that's pretty cool.

1505
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,340
And they could watch that over and over,
you know,

1506
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:05,410
or they mess around with it or maybe 
they,

1507
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,313
you know,
put some in Mum's hair cause that's 

1508
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:08,434
interesting to it.
They have two or three bites and then 

1509
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:12,520
they're not ravenous and then they're 
much more interested in playing.

1510
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:13,803
And that's fine except that if the kid 
does need then it gets crabby and you 

1511
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,124
know,
whiny and miserable and then it just 

1512
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,690
disturbs the mother or the father and 
then it won't sleep at night.

1513
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,750
It's like that's no good.
So after about three days of that,

1514
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:26,584
I took the spoon back from him and he 
was not happy about that man trying to 

1515
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:32,230
get that little kid to eat.
Once I got the spoon,

1516
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:33,820
it was like a four hour battle.

1517
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,270
It was really remarkable.
So I,

1518
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,333
I,
I had a lot of respect for his ability 

1519
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:42,070
just to withstand stubbornness,
you know?

1520
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:45,730
But I'd learned by that time as a parent
that like if you want to discipline your

1521
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,900
child,
you,

1522
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:50,380
there's an attitude you have to take,
which is I am going to win this.

1523
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,160
Like I don't care how stubborn you are,
I am going to win.

1524
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:57,460
And because I know I'm going to win,
I'm not going to get angry.

1525
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:00,580
I'm just going to out stubborn you.
And so,

1526
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,510
so I take up some food and put it in 
front of him.

1527
01:17:04,511 --> 01:17:08,350
He go like this.
So that was a good trick.

1528
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:10,870
And so I tried get the food in there and
his teeth regretted.

1529
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:13,940
So I poke him,
you know,

1530
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,541
poke,
poke,

1531
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:15,021
poke,
poke.

1532
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:15,854
And after about 10 pokes,
he'd get annoyed and go and I put the 

1533
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:18,850
food yet.

1534
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,890
And then he tried to spit it out so I'd 
hold it.

1535
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:21,860
He had in this.
So then,

1536
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,600
so that was like three minutes,
you know,

1537
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:25,140
and then we did it with another 
spoonful.

1538
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,420
And you know,
after about,

1539
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,360
I'd say an hour of this,
my wife had to leave because it was like

1540
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:32,450
she just couldn't handle it.
And about an hour after this,

1541
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,430
he decided that,
you know,

1542
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,960
it was okayed and that he would let me 
feed them.

1543
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:39,530
But like it was brutal and it was 
amazing.

1544
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:41,930
I mean,
little kids are so damn tough,

1545
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:44,000
you know,
they're really cute and everything and,

1546
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,010
but they're so tough,
you just can't believe it.

1547
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:46,844
So anyways,
so we had this good at the table and he 

1548
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:53,600
was not going to eat.
So my wife who'd learned these tricks by

1549
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,390
this time decided to feed him and he had
a lot of,

1550
01:17:56,530 --> 01:18:00,440
sort of nine month old or eight month 
old behaviors because you know,

1551
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:01,274
kids have different strategies of 
resistance if they don't want to do 

1552
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:03,890
something.

1553
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,920
And those strategies get more 
sophisticated as they get older.

1554
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,810
But,
and he had some strategies,

1555
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:10,760
but they weren't sophisticated,
you know,

1556
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,190
like he didn't make jokes or knock this 
spoon way or,

1557
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:16,400
or get angry or,
or run away or any of those things.

1558
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:17,234
He did kind of nine month old things,
which means he just put his head down 

1559
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,773
and when she put the spoon towards him,
he just avert his head one way or 

1560
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:24,500
another.
So.

1561
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,753
So that was interesting because I knew 
that his parents had given up feeding 

1562
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:32,060
him when he was about eight or nine 
months old because those tricks worked.

1563
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:33,950
And so that's why she could come to the 
house and saying,

1564
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:36,170
he probably won't eat all day.
But that's all right.

1565
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,120
Which it isn't.
It's not.

1566
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:40,880
All right.
So find,

1567
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:43,400
so my wife is trying to feed him and he 
doesn't open his mouth,

1568
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:45,960
so she pokes from Tibet and sooner or 
later he gets mad and you know,

1569
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,590
goes ah,
and she puts the food in and she does.

1570
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,980
And then she pats him on the head as 
soon as he swallows it and says,

1571
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,240
look,
you're being a really good kid.

1572
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:54,440
You know,
you're doing a good job.

1573
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:57,110
And then,
so he's wondering what the Hell is going

1574
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:57,944
on?
And then it was so interesting because 

1575
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:02,030
she kept feeding him and he was still 
doing this,

1576
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,013
but as she patted him on the head,
he'd be doing this and he'd open his 

1577
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:06,554
mouth.
So it was like there was this weird 

1578
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:08,594
conflict between his habitual behavior 
and this thing that was being 

1579
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:12,750
reinforced.
So then she'd,

1580
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,020
you know,
put food in and pat him and he,

1581
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:16,700
you know,
he'd be kind of happy about that.

1582
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:20,360
And then he'd go back to his routine.
And then she did that for,

1583
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,093
I think about 20 minutes.
It wasn't disruptive like all the other 

1584
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:24,674
kids ate.
They didn't even really notice what was 

1585
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:26,030
going on.

1586
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,560
It wasn't,
it wasn't a big deal,

1587
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:28,394
you know,
but I was watching because I knew 

1588
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,690
something was up because the stupid 
thing that his mother said,

1589
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:35,060
and then the fact that he wouldn't play,
and he ignored me.

1590
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:35,790
I thought,
Nah,

1591
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,310
there's some reading,
not good here.

1592
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,860
There's dragon here.
And it's a big one.

1593
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,440
So she feeds him and then he finishes 
the whole bull.

1594
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:46,610
It's like,
and she says,

1595
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:48,950
you're a good boy.
You ate the whole bull and Jesus,

1596
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,510
you should have seen what happened to 
that kid.

1597
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:51,950
Man,
it just about broke my heart.

1598
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:52,784
Like really?
Like his eyes got big and he smiled and 

1599
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:56,294
he was just like,
he was super thrilled because he'd 

1600
01:19:58,690 --> 01:19:59,523
finally accomplished this absolute basic
necessity that he hadn't mastered in 

1601
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,890
four years.
He finally got it right and you think of

1602
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,973
of meals that he went through either 
being ignored or failing three times a 

1603
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:12,990
day for like three years.

1604
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,680
Nothing but failure and bad responses 
and you know,

1605
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,603
he didn't turn,
realized all that he thought he was a 

1606
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:22,080
bad kid and then all of a sudden post he
figured this out and you know,

1607
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:22,914
get a little reward for it.
It was like he just lit up and that 

1608
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:25,674
whole shell that he had on that he was 
like using to protect himself when he 

1609
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:32,130
was in the porch.
That just melted away.

1610
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,233
It was like,
it was horrifying and amazing at the 

1611
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,444
same time.
And then he followed my wife around 

1612
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,170
after that in the house,
just like a puppy dog.

1613
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:44,340
Like he wouldn't get,
he would not get more than one foot away

1614
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,320
from her.
It was unbelievable.

1615
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:47,154
And then we went downstairs to watch 
like a movie with the kids and she sat 

1616
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:51,084
on a rocking chair and he climbed right 
up on her lap and grabbed her just like 

1617
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:53,430
that.

1618
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:55,740
Harlow monkey grabbed the,
you know,

1619
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:58,140
the little soft mother instead of the 
wire.

1620
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:02,160
He mother pm's like this and he was like
that for like two hours.

1621
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:06,150
He wouldn't let her go.
So then the mother came home,

1622
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,373
his mother came home and she came 
downstairs and she looked at what was 

1623
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:11,131
going on,
you know,

1624
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:15,510
and this kid was like glommed onto my 
wife and she looked at her and she said,

1625
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,500
oh,
supermom.

1626
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,180
And you know,
took her kid and went home.

1627
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:21,240
It's like Jesus,
like if you don't think there's a dragon

1628
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:22,170
and that story,
man,

1629
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:24,930
you are not listening to it.
It was not good.

1630
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,780
And her response at the end was 
terrible.

1631
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,870
She should have said,
well,

1632
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:32,370
how'd you get them to eat?
It's like,

1633
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,960
what?
What the hell is he doing?

1634
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:36,510
Like hugging you?
He never does that to me.

1635
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,620
No Way,
man.

1636
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,453
She was going to let that piece of 
information in and it's no wonder 

1637
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:41,874
because the dragon and that story was 
her and it was something she did not 

1638
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:49,800
want to admit and she was willing,
perfectly willing to sacrifice her child

1639
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:52,200
to that,
to her failure to realize that she could

1640
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:53,034
be a dragon.
So that meant that the child was the 

1641
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:58,200
problem and that's a hell of a thing to 
do to a four year old.

1642
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:02,970
So it was not pleasant.
It was really not pleasant.

1643
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,503
In fact,
we probably did damage to the child by 

1644
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,390
actually getting them to do something 
good.

1645
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,224
A because we opened up him up to the 
possibility that he could behave 

1646
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:17,610
properly and be rewarded for that.
And that gave them hope.

1647
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,433
And so you can bloody well be sure that 
that hope was dispensed with the next 

1648
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:23,423
day

1649
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,473
salt.

1650
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:27,980
And that's why billy doesn't get 
anything to eat.

1651
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,533
Yes.

1652
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,673
Oh No,
I'd still do it because you know the 

1653
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:48,924
child,
at least the child got to learn that 

1654
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,830
there was adult somewhere in the world 
that would pay attention to them.

1655
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,650
You know,
so I mean,

1656
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,441
yes.
Well,

1657
01:22:58,441 --> 01:22:59,970
you have to,
you know,

1658
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:03,030
you can't let things that aren't right 
or occur under your,

1659
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,800
under your supervision,
you know,

1660
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,783
it's not appropriate.
And you should pay attention to little 

1661
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,700
kids.
You know,

1662
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,120
they're,
they're remarkable little things and you

1663
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:15,550
know,
they there,

1664
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:19,420
if you pay attention to your kids,
you'll never have better companions.

1665
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,561
You know,
children,

1666
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,990
they're remarkable.
They're really easy to get along with.

1667
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:25,240
Unless they're hungry or tired or hot or
cold.

1668
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:26,860
It's like you should be able to deal 
with that.

1669
01:23:26,861 --> 01:23:28,210
Writes for things.
It's like,

1670
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,260
is he hot?
Is He called his,

1671
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:30,610
he hungry?
You know,

1672
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,200
does he have to go to the bathroom?

1673
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,270
That's it.
And then,

1674
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:35,260
you know,
wherever you take them,

1675
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:38,020
they're happy until they get tired or 
hot or cold or hungry.

1676
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:40,600
And by that time,
you're probably one of those things.

1677
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:41,434
But you're too stupid to notice.
So the kid will notice first and then 

1678
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,430
you're done.
But it's fun.

1679
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:47,440
And the kids are like,
they're like little,

1680
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,630
they don't have any latent inhibition,
technically,

1681
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,780
I think is what's going on.
But when you're around little kids,

1682
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,430
you know you're no longer cynical 
because they still see the world and you

1683
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:01,120
can't because you're old and stupid and 
blind and you know the kid can still see

1684
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:03,010
the world.
And so when you take the kids around,

1685
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,640
you can see the world again because you 
can see it through their eyes and that's

1686
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,100
such a gift.
It's just unbelievable.

1687
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,650
So you know,
you don't want to mess with that and you

1688
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:12,484
don't want to be the one that's 
responsible for deciding that the kid 

1689
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:17,320
happens to be the monster that you won't
admit you are.

1690
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:19,150
And believe me,
you're a monster.

1691
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:19,984
There's absolutely no doubt about it.
The question is only do you know it and 

1692
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:26,080
are you going to do something about it?
And if you think that's wrong,

1693
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:27,370
then well,
you know,

1694
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,110
good luck to you.

1695
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,980
Belly went upstairs to brush his teeth.
Mothers started clearing the table.

1696
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:39,280
The dragon who is quite as big as 
mothered by this time,

1697
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:40,840
that's not so good,
right?

1698
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,740
Made himself comfortable on the hall rug
and went to sleep.

1699
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,430
So now she's ignored something for so 
long that it's basically her size.

1700
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:53,803
You know,
I've seen people in therapy talking 

1701
01:24:56,991 --> 01:25:00,260
about their marriages when they're sort 
of on the verge of divorce,

1702
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,860
you know,
and uh,

1703
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:04,813
they have dragons that they,
that the person brings with them that 

1704
01:25:08,841 --> 01:25:09,674
are their size or bigger.
And what that means in some sense is 

1705
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,274
that they've ignored certain things for 
so long that the problem has become so 

1706
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:17,294
complex and multifaceted and 
multi-headed that they no longer have 

1707
01:25:19,911 --> 01:25:22,820
the energy or the ability to solve it.
So it's like,

1708
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,133
you know,
I tried to calculate at certain times 

1709
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:28,130
how many decisions that you make during 
the day,

1710
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:29,870
you know,
whether you're going to react one way or

1711
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:32,810
another and maybe you're doing that in 
the context of a relationship.

1712
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:33,890
You know,
and you know,

1713
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,753
most of you know,
if you've had a relationship of any 

1714
01:25:36,051 --> 01:25:36,771
length,
you know,

1715
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:37,604
more than a couple of months,
you start to actually interact with the 

1716
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,300
person rather than your idea of the 
person.

1717
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,450
And you know,
there are conflicts and part of them are

1718
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:47,660
because you're both stupid,
neurotic and ignorant and half crazy.

1719
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,493
And some of them are because life has 
real problems and there's really 

1720
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:54,680
difficult things like conflicts of 
interest that have to be worked out.

1721
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:55,723
It's really hard and you know you can,
with each interaction that you have 

1722
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:00,284
within a relationship,
you basically decide whether you're 

1723
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:02,714
going to address the reality that's in 
front of you or whether you're going to 

1724
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:08,870
let it slide.
And you know,

1725
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:09,704
if you let 10 or 20 things slide a day,
those are all things that would in 

1726
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:19,030
principle have to be addressed in order 
to keep the relationship pristine and,

1727
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,890
and functional and adapted to the 
current situation.

1728
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:22,963
You let 20 things like that slide a day.
It's like 150 a week or 600 a month or 

1729
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,780
7,000
a year and you do that for 10 years,

1730
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:32,840
then it's 75,000
things that you haven't dealt with.

1731
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,730
And so then you go to therapy and was 
saying,

1732
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,170
our marriage isn't so good.

1733
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,820
And you know,
you look behind it,

1734
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:39,500
you see,
oh there's 75,000

1735
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:42,560
problems that you haven't solved.
It's like good luck starting now.

1736
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:44,540
You know,
you just can't do it.

1737
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,990
And at that point,
maybe there's no way out divorced.

1738
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:50,960
It's like good luck with that.
Especially if you have children.

1739
01:26:50,961 --> 01:26:52,820
It's like you might as well have 
terminal cancer.

1740
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,073
You know,
getting divorced with children is no 

1741
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:56,144
joke.
And I've seen people's lives absolutely 

1742
01:26:57,981 --> 01:27:01,580
demolished by that so that there was no 
hope they could recover.

1743
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:04,730
It's really not good.
I mean sometimes it works and the people

1744
01:27:04,731 --> 01:27:05,450
are,
you know,

1745
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,540
they can communicate enough to be 
reasonable about the,

1746
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:12,290
about the distribution of assets and,
and the children's custody.

1747
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:14,360
But you know,
if they're not reasonable,

1748
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:15,200
whoa,
my God,

1749
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:16,034
it's just awful.
So don't generate problems around 

1750
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:20,564
yourself by avoiding unnecessary things 
until the problem is so big that it's 

1751
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:26,660
bigger than you because you're basically
done at that point.

1752
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,180
You can't fix it.
You don't have the energy.

1753
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:32,960
So you can tell when a couples like 
that,

1754
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:36,830
because they keep bringing up things 
from the past like 20 year ago,

1755
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:37,840
things,
you know,

1756
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,700
he's always like,
you're,

1757
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,420
you've,
you've always been like that.

1758
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,433
You're like that now.
And you'll always be like that in the 

1759
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:44,834
future.
It's like that's no way to begin to 

1760
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,470
negotiation.
And then you can remember something that

1761
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:51,050
happened 20 years ago and bring it up.
It's like,

1762
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,180
that'll make you happy.

1763
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,400
By the time billy came back downstairs,
the dragon had grown so much.

1764
01:27:59,401 --> 01:28:00,234
He filled the hall.
Billy only had to go around by way of 

1765
01:28:02,521 --> 01:28:04,350
the living room to get to where his 
mother was.

1766
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,350
I didn't know dragons grew so fast at 
billy.

1767
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,700
There's no such thing as a dragon.
Said mother firmly.

1768
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,363
Yeah,

1769
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,110
cleaning the downstairs took mother all 
morning.

1770
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:21,944
What was the dragon in the way?
And having to climb in and out of 

1771
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,254
windows to get from room to room.
It's like that's a really funny one day 

1772
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:27,614
because it's like,
it's so obvious now that there's 

1773
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:31,160
something up,
but she's still not going to admit it.

1774
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:32,450
And so,
you know,

1775
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:33,613
I've,
I've been in places like that to where 

1776
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:37,363
there's so much interpersonal tension 
among the participants and so many 

1777
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:41,084
pathological things going on in the 
household that nothing simple can get 

1778
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:45,950
done.
You know?

1779
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:46,784
So like maybe that the job of making a 
tuna sandwich takes like two hours 

1780
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:53,000
because there's nothing,
but first of all,

1781
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:55,250
nobody can find anything to make it 
with.

1782
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,263
And you know,
the fridge is empty and maybe the tuna 

1783
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:00,500
cans or six years old and the breads all
moldy and stale.

1784
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,334
And then even if that wasn't the case,
they can't figure out who the hell is 

1785
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:04,770
going to go shopping.

1786
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:07,230
And then even if they could manage that,
there'd be big fight around,

1787
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,393
you know,
what should be on the sandwich and how 

1788
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:11,300
much tuna.
And so the,

1789
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,220
the point of this little part of the 
story is that,

1790
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,210
you know,
a simple task is only a simple task.

1791
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:21,690
If there aren't all sorts of impediments
around cluttering it up,

1792
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:22,801
you know,
and,

1793
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:23,634
and if,
and if there are impediments like that 

1794
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:26,880
cluttering it up,
then you just can't get it done.

1795
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:29,670
And then you can see why that's so 
terribly stressful.

1796
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:30,504
Because what it means in part is that 
there is no way that you can just do 

1797
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:34,164
something straight forward with ease.
Everything is about everything all the 

1798
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:38,520
time.
It's like,

1799
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,720
oh,
it's awful.

1800
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,310
It's awful.
And it's very,

1801
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:42,144
very common.

1802
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:46,770
You know,
you see couples all the time.

1803
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:48,300
This is a modern problem.
You know,

1804
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,293
one of the advantages to traditional 
divisions of labor is that everybody 

1805
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,660
knows what to do.
Now you might say,

1806
01:29:57,661 --> 01:29:58,950
well that's not fair.
It's like,

1807
01:29:58,951 --> 01:29:59,790
yeah,
okay fine.

1808
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:01,290
It's not fair.
That's probably true.

1809
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:04,380
The question is what the hell is the 
alternative?

1810
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:10,530
And the alternative is you have to 
negotiate every single task.

1811
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:13,890
So you know,
if you're going to habit with someone at

1812
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:16,020
some point in the future,
here's your options.

1813
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:20,850
Slavery,
tyranny or negotiation.

1814
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,013
So you can be the slave,
you can be the tyrant or you can 

1815
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:24,564
negotiate.
But the problem is in the absence of 

1816
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:31,320
routine and ritual and tradition,
there's no rules.

1817
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,250
So everything has to be negotiated.
And the problem with that is most people

1818
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:37,590
can't negotiate.
They don't know how,

1819
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:39,930
you know,
cause the negotiation,

1820
01:30:39,931 --> 01:30:43,050
it's a complex process and people are 
very unlikely to engage in it.

1821
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:43,883
So when I'm,
when I'm trying to get people to make 

1822
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:46,800
decisions,
when they,

1823
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:48,990
when they have to deal with something 
that's very complicated,

1824
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,090
the first thing I do is I say,
okay,

1825
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:51,471
look,
let,

1826
01:30:51,471 --> 01:30:53,580
let's lay out the problem space.
Okay,

1827
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:57,660
all we're going to do is discuss what 
might be going on here.

1828
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:58,494
We're not going to jump to any 
conclusions about whether any of these 

1829
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,390
theories are correct.
We're just going to contemplate them.

1830
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,613
And right away there's resistance to 
that because it's very difficult for 

1831
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:11,841
people to separate a hypothesis about 
the way things are from a description of

1832
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:16,134
the way things are.
So they get afraid that as soon as you 

1833
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,840
discuss something in a certain way that 
that's the way it's going to be.

1834
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:25,230
And so they can't even lay out the 
problem space.

1835
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,360
So that's the first impediment to 
negotiation.

1836
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:30,900
And then another impediment is,
um,

1837
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,780
they can define what they want,
you know,

1838
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:36,060
so like if you and I are going to 
negotiate about something,

1839
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:39,660
one of the things you need to know is 
what I could do that would satisfy you.

1840
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:41,280
And if the answer is,
well,

1841
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:44,430
if you knew me better,
you'd know what would satisfy me.

1842
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,340
Which is a very common answer.
It's like I'm,

1843
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,440
I'm hatched right from the beginning 
because like I'm stupid.

1844
01:31:49,441 --> 01:31:52,200
I don't know what will satisfy you.
I don't even know what will satisfy me.

1845
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,180
You have to,
you have to tell me,

1846
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:56,070
cause I'm not very bright.
It's like,

1847
01:31:56,071 --> 01:31:57,750
what do you want?
Well I don't know.

1848
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:58,680
It's like,
oh no,

1849
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,070
that's not good.
It's like,

1850
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,630
no,
we have two problems.

1851
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,360
The problem and whatever would make you 
happy.

1852
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:06,160
It's like,
it's terrible.

1853
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,350
And then you have to lay out the 
solution space.

1854
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:08,771
It's like,
what?

1855
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:11,410
We could do it this way or we could do 
it this way or we could do it this way,

1856
01:32:11,411 --> 01:32:13,400
or here's another option,
or this is an option.

1857
01:32:13,401 --> 01:32:15,460
And like why don't you think those 
through?

1858
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:16,294
It's like,
oh,

1859
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,340
that's a whole set of multiple 
realities.

1860
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:19,570
It's overwhelming.
It's like,

1861
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,880
I'm not doing that.
I'm tired of this discussion.

1862
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:23,350
I'm gone.
So,

1863
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:27,803
so there's a dragon in everyone's house 
of that size now because no one knows 

1864
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:34,290
what to do and no one knows how to solve
the problem of what to do because people

1865
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:36,840
don't know how to negotiate.
They just aren't good at it.

1866
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,450
It's hard to negotiate,
you know,

1867
01:32:39,451 --> 01:32:44,451
cause you have to suspend your judgment 
and you have to have a symbolic war that

1868
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:46,584
doesn't erupt into a real war.
And then you have to solve it and then 

1869
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:54,000
people have to agree to the solution and
then they have to enact a solution,

1870
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:54,930
right?
They have to be,

1871
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,360
they have to be,
they have to what?

1872
01:32:57,390 --> 01:33:02,390
Act Out their word once the solution has
been negotiated and it happens,

1873
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:06,390
but it's very difficult.
So people avoid it all the time and then

1874
01:33:06,391 --> 01:33:08,400
everything becomes incredibly 
complicated.

1875
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:15,530
I went to her house once quite regularly
where the husband refused to,

1876
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,580
he was kind of a traditionalist,
you know,

1877
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:22,440
and he refused to ever thank his wife 
for doing anything that was domestically

1878
01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:23,580
related,
like cooking now.

1879
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:25,350
And she also had a career and it was,
you know,

1880
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:26,184
a pretty demanding careers.
So it wasn't self evident that she 

1881
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:31,230
should be the one that was doing this,
but that doesn't matter.

1882
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:32,093
You know,

1883
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,670
she could cook but she wouldn't.
And so every time I went there,

1884
01:33:36,671 --> 01:33:40,090
I had the most God awful food.
It was just staggeringly terrible.

1885
01:33:40,091 --> 01:33:41,290
You know,
everything had done,

1886
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:42,124
been done to that food to torture it,
that add intelligent and irritated 

1887
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:46,384
person could possibly do.
And so the price that was being paid in 

1888
01:33:48,941 --> 01:33:51,340
that and the kids would neat and it's No
God damn wonder.

1889
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:52,720
You know?
It's like who would eat that?

1890
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:53,973
You know?
And so the price the family was paying 

1891
01:33:55,391 --> 01:34:00,391
for not negotiating around this complex 
operation because running a domestic,

1892
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,310
okay.
Economy is very complex operation.

1893
01:34:03,311 --> 01:34:04,144
The price they paid for it was,
every single meal was like curdled with 

1894
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:11,890
resentment and the food quality was 
terrible and everyone was angry.

1895
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,210
It's like,
oh my God,

1896
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:16,990
that's like four hours a day of that.
You know,

1897
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,390
that's like a quarter of your waking 
life.

1898
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,190
So,
and you know,

1899
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,323
after engaging in that sort of 
interaction with your husband or your 

1900
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:27,220
wife for like a quarter of the day for 
10 years,

1901
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:28,054
you can be sure that whatever goodwill 
you might have stored up is pretty much 

1902
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:32,350
evaporated.
So,

1903
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:34,270
you know,
one thing that you might think about,

1904
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:36,480
and this is counter intuitive,
you know,

1905
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:40,150
because people think what are the most 
important events in your life?

1906
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,430
And you know,
no one is going to say breakfast.

1907
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:43,601
You know,
you think,

1908
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:45,450
well I went to Europe for two weeks this
summer,

1909
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:47,560
something like that.
It's like all that stuff's irrelevant.

1910
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,980
Who Cares about that?
Exceptions are irrelevant.

1911
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:53,940
Your life is made up of the things you 
do every day.

1912
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,470
That's what it's made up of.
So,

1913
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:57,304
you know,
I know how many thousands of hours 

1914
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,260
you're going to spend having breakfast 
over the,

1915
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:01,640
you know,
the course of your life.

1916
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,610
But it's going to be something like one 
16th of the time you have left.

1917
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:06,680
So let's say you've got eight years 
left,

1918
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:07,953
that means you're gonna have,
you're gonna have spent five years 

1919
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:11,690
having breakfast.
It's like get it right.

1920
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,903
You know,
cause about I would say about half of 

1921
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:19,580
your life is routine and if you get the 
routines right,

1922
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:20,414
you know,
so everybody sits down and meals real 

1923
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:22,544
good and everybody's happy about it and 
all the little decisions have been 

1924
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:26,180
distributed property.
It's like Poof,

1925
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,073
half your life is good.
So you know and you won't get sat and 

1926
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:33,110
have an eating disorder,
which is also,

1927
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,093
it's also kind of a plus or you won't 
get as fat or have as much of an eating 

1928
01:35:37,851 --> 01:35:41,810
disorder by noon.
The dragon filled doubts,

1929
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:42,743
it's head hung out the front door.
It's tail hung out the back door and 

1930
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:46,424
there wasn't a room in the house that 
didn't have some part of the dragon in 

1931
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:49,064
it.

1932
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:52,610
Hmm.
I bet that there is a house like that on

1933
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:55,430
some of you will live.
You know where there's a lot of houses,

1934
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,080
somebody live in apartments,
it doesn't really matter.

1935
01:35:57,081 --> 01:36:00,020
But I bet you if you live in a house on 
a block of houses,

1936
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,093
there's at least one house on that 
street where the tail of the dragon has 

1937
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,980
started to come out of the house.
And you know what,

1938
01:36:06,981 --> 01:36:07,814
that's like gay because it's the house 
that you don't really want to look at 

1939
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:11,240
when you walk by.
You know,

1940
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:12,400
and maybe,
I don't know,

1941
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:13,243
that needs a new roof and like the doors
a little bit crooked and the law and 

1942
01:36:15,861 --> 01:36:17,210
isn't cotton.
You know,

1943
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:18,044
there's some rusty things lying around 
there and like it's just not taken care 

1944
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:22,670
of.
And you know,

1945
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:24,800
and maybe you know from the gossip in 
the neighborhood too,

1946
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:28,610
that there's something going on in that 
house that is just not good and it's got

1947
01:36:28,611 --> 01:36:29,444
to the point where it's so not good that
it's starting to spread itself out 

1948
01:36:33,111 --> 01:36:35,330
beyond the domestic confines of the 
house.

1949
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,460
So you know,
you love,

1950
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:39,470
you run into people like that now.
And then too,

1951
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:41,330
you'll notice this.
So you know,

1952
01:36:41,331 --> 01:36:43,150
sometimes,
I don't know if this has happened to him

1953
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:44,013
of you,
but it might have tapped you in some 

1954
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:46,750
ways.
You know that there,

1955
01:36:46,751 --> 01:36:47,584
there was people who can't not tell you 
everything about what's going on in 

1956
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:52,520
their life,
even if you've hardly even met them.

1957
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:55,010
If you see someone who's really in 
trouble,

1958
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,083
you know you'll sit on the bus and 
somebody who's clearly on the road to 

1959
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:01,244
being thoroughly de deranged,
we'll sit down beside you and they'll 

1960
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:05,780
start telling you about the problems of 
their life.

1961
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,823
It's like,
you know that the dragon that they're 

1962
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:10,190
dealing with is so big that they can't 
even contain it.

1963
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:15,340
There are so desperate to have it dealt 
with that they can't not talk about it.

1964
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:16,460
You know?

1965
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,620
And there's lots of people like that.
They're the ones,

1966
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:21,320
what is that stupid little phrase?
Tmi.

1967
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:23,060
Is that right?
Too much information.

1968
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,081
It's like,
yeah,

1969
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:24,914
well why does that happen?
It's because people are dealing with 

1970
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,154
anomalies and unexpected occurrences and
tragedies and they cannot articulate a 

1971
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:35,600
solution.
And most people think by talking,

1972
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,450
which is also part of the reason that 
therapy works.

1973
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:42,140
It's right.
Well do you think I doubted you might,

1974
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,020
but very few people think,
you know?

1975
01:37:45,021 --> 01:37:47,870
And so if you want to solve a problem,
you want to talk it over with a friend.

1976
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,840
And so you know,
you might just think that you're talking

1977
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:53,120
about the problem sort of.
You know what the problem is,

1978
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:54,680
but you're talking about.
So you don't,

1979
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,740
when you talk about it,
you articulate the problem space.

1980
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:02,160
You start to generate potential 
hypotheses about solutions.

1981
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:03,960
But more than that,
if you're talking to someone,

1982
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,063
you can watch them just like the little 
kid with the mouse would watch the 

1983
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:07,500
mother.

1984
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,250
It's like,
well,

1985
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,410
here's what I think the problem is.
And if you go,

1986
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,630
you know you're listening and you go 
like that,

1987
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:13,680
you roll your eyes,
you know,

1988
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:14,514
it's a hint to the person that maybe 
that's not the most appropriate way to 

1989
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:19,710
formulate the problem.
Now maybe you don't roll your eyes,

1990
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,544
but you know you don't encourage them.
Or maybe they tell you what the problem 

1991
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,830
is and you're really actively engaged 
in.

1992
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:26,664
You're nodding.
Well then they know that maybe they 

1993
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:28,464
formulated the way someone have sane and
tolerable would formulate it and then 

1994
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,920
they can walk through the solution.
So,

1995
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:43,180
so when you sit down beside someone and 
they have to tell you everything,

1996
01:38:43,181 --> 01:38:44,014
one of the things that you know is that 
they don't have anyone to listen to 

1997
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:47,374
them.
And part of what happens in therapy and 

1998
01:38:51,281 --> 01:38:53,080
a huge part of it is that you just 
listened.

1999
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:55,570
I have one client that's,
that's all I ever do with her.

2000
01:38:55,571 --> 01:38:56,404
She comes in twice,
once every two weeks and I just sit 

2001
01:38:58,331 --> 01:38:59,164
there and listen to her for an hour and 
now I can maybe have a bit of a 

2002
01:39:02,141 --> 01:39:04,270
discussion with her for the last 10 
minutes.

2003
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,360
But if I try to say anything for the 
first 50 minutes,

2004
01:39:07,361 --> 01:39:10,120
she just looks kinda irritated.
And you know,

2005
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:12,820
it's like I've interrupted the flow of 
the,

2006
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:17,710
of the interaction and she's alone.
She's an everybody to talk to.

2007
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,360
So,
you know,

2008
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:23,680
she wants to listen to herself think and
she can't do that by herself.

2009
01:39:23,681 --> 01:39:26,470
She has to have someone to do it with.
And so,

2010
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:27,603
you know,
people think by talking and some people 

2011
01:39:29,501 --> 01:39:32,770
have no one to talk to and so their 
problems start to spill out.

2012
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:33,783
And you know,
by that time you can't even help them 

2013
01:39:35,081 --> 01:39:37,450
usually because if you listen for three 
years,

2014
01:39:37,451 --> 01:39:38,284
it wouldn't be enough listening.
He just listen forever and you'd never 

2015
01:39:40,871 --> 01:39:41,830
get to the bottom of it.

2016
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:04,170
And the dragon awoke from his nap.
He was hungry.

2017
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:06,723
Bakery truck went by,
the smell of fresh bread was more than 

2018
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:14,001
the dragon could resist.
The dragon ran down the street after the

2019
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:14,904
bakery truck,
the house went along of course like the 

2020
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:17,490
shell on a snail.

2021
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,513
Cool.

2022
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,330
Read this book a while back,
I think it was called the glass castle.

2023
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,220
It's very,
very cool book.

2024
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:35,743
It's about this woman whose parents were
extremely creative and intelligent and 

2025
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,173
unbelievably unconscientious like just 
so unconscientious that it was mind 

2026
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:46,520
boggling,
disorderly and non industrious.

2027
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:47,890
And,
and so they were,

2028
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:48,743
they were a little bit on the 
psychopathic edge of things and you 

2029
01:40:51,891 --> 01:40:52,724
know,
her father would up all sorts of new 

2030
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:56,980
ideas and many of them were actually 
brilliant because he was no idiot,

2031
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:59,080
but he was kind of a petty crook and you
know,

2032
01:40:59,081 --> 01:41:02,200
he'd get gambling trouble and,
and you know,

2033
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:05,580
cheap people at cards and not pay his 
bills and so on.

2034
01:41:05,581 --> 01:41:07,300
And so like every three months they had 
to move.

2035
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,600
And like if you have to move every three
months,

2036
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:11,523
you know that the dragon in your 
household has got so big that it's 

2037
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:14,584
actually the one that's carrying around 
the house and that happens to people a 

2038
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:18,214
lot.
And so their lives are so disorganized 

2039
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:23,020
they can't even stay in one place for 
any length of time.

2040
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,700
No.
So

2041
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,813
the mailman was just coming up the paths
with some mail for the big speeds when 

2042
01:41:33,141 --> 01:41:35,230
their house rush past him and headed 
down the street,

2043
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,020
he chased it for a few blogs but he 
couldn't catch it.

2044
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:40,303
Okay.

2045
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,213
Oh,
if you move enough and you're unstable 

2046
01:41:44,871 --> 01:41:45,704
enough,
then none of the rest of society can 

2047
01:41:48,381 --> 01:41:49,214
communicate with you or stay in touch 
with you and that deprives you of all 

2048
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:55,760
the benefits that a certain degree of 
predictability would confer upon you.

2049
01:41:56,770 --> 01:42:00,590
Like you don't get your mail.
Mr.

2050
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,270
Buck bixby.
He's quite a genius too.

2051
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:05,630
When mixture,
Mr Bixby came home for lunch,

2052
01:42:05,631 --> 01:42:07,940
the first thing he noticed was that this
house was gone.

2053
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:13,100
It's like sometimes people don't notice 
things until it's got to that point.

2054
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:13,934
Right.
Because now and then you hear a story 

2055
01:42:14,631 --> 01:42:15,464
about someone coming home and like their
wife has packed up and taken the 

2056
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:20,600
children and that was the end of that 
and the person says,

2057
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:21,800
well,
I never saw that coming.

2058
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:25,790
It's like right,
you never saw it coming.

2059
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,910
And Mr Bixby,
conventional sort of guy,

2060
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:30,980
a little bit on the clueless side.
Obvious.

2061
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:34,370
Obviously he didn't know what the hell 
was going on.

2062
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:35,204
He comes home and his house is gone and 
it's a neighbor that has to tell him 

2063
01:42:37,821 --> 01:42:38,654
where it went.
It's like he's just as inattentive as 

2064
01:42:42,171 --> 01:42:43,004
his wife.

2065
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:44,873
Okay.

2066
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:46,223
Mr Bixby got in his car and went looking
for the house where he studied all the 

2067
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:49,794
houses as he drove along.
Finally he saw one that looked familiar 

2068
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,890
belly and Mrs Bixby,
we're waving from an upstairs window.

2069
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,173
Okay.

2070
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,413
Mr Bixby climbed over the dragon's head 
onto the porch roof and through the 

2071
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:11,990
upstairs window.

2072
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:21,060
How did this happen,
Mr?

2073
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:23,370
Bixby asked.
That's a good question.

2074
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,233
Right,
and that's where the story actually 

2075
01:43:24,931 --> 01:43:28,380
starts to turn around because somebody 
finally admits that there's a problem.

2076
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,090
So they say,
well,

2077
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:34,050
what's going on?
Which is to say there is a problem,

2078
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,240
you know,
because when you make a statement,

2079
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,223
the statement has all sorts of 
inferential meanings that are attached 

2080
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:41,520
to it.
And just to say,

2081
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,563
well what's the problem is also to say,
well that there is a problem and to say 

2082
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:47,994
that it's worthwhile formulating the 
statement that a problem and that it's 

2083
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:54,800
worthwhile thinking about it,
that's a big move.

2084
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:55,634
You know,
one of the things that Carl Rogers said 

2085
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:58,550
about therapy and he's absolutely right 
about this,

2086
01:43:58,551 --> 01:43:59,384
is that there are preconditions for 
therapeutic improvement and one of them 

2087
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:03,443
is the person who comes for therapy has 
to admit that there's a problem before 

2088
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:09,320
they come and they have to want to have 
a solution.

2089
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:12,830
And if that situation isn't there,
you can't do anything with them.

2090
01:44:12,831 --> 01:44:16,230
I,
I had people assigned to me at sometimes

2091
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:18,680
by the court,
it's like court assigned therapy.

2092
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:22,970
That is not useful because it's like the
person has to say,

2093
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:25,920
while I'm in trouble and there could be 
a solution,

2094
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:26,863
you know,
otherwise they're just sitting there 

2095
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:28,970
like this,
you know,

2096
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,863
sort of looking at you.
Or I had one guy who was a real 

2097
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:34,250
psychopath.
He was a child abuser and you know,

2098
01:44:34,251 --> 01:44:35,084
all he did the whole bloody therapeutic 
that the whole time I was with was brag 

2099
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:40,610
about what a pillar of community he was.
You know,

2100
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,920
and I,
he was really quite psychopathic,

2101
01:44:42,921 --> 01:44:44,900
so I tried to at least convince him 
that,

2102
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,333
you know,
he was likely to continue to get in 

2103
01:44:49,661 --> 01:44:51,700
trouble if he didn't stop what he was 
doing.

2104
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:54,280
But you know,
he was also one of those people who knew

2105
01:44:54,281 --> 01:44:55,114
absolutely everything and there was 
nothing at all that anybody could ever 

2106
01:44:57,971 --> 01:44:58,810
tell him.
And you know,

2107
01:44:58,811 --> 01:45:03,130
it was,
it was just like there was,

2108
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,443
I was,
it wasn't any more useful than it would 

2109
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:09,520
have been if I wasn't even in the room 
is completely pointless.

2110
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:13,510
So because he didn't have a problem,
everybody else had a problem.

2111
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,000
Dragon wagged his tail happily then even
faster than it had grown.

2112
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:25,001
The dragon started getting smaller.
Sooner is Kipnis sized again.

2113
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,870
I don't mind dragons this size said 
mother,

2114
01:45:41,070 --> 01:45:45,000
she's certainly come around.
Why did it have to grow so big?

2115
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,473
I'm not sure said belly,
but I think it just wanted to be 

2116
01:45:48,191 --> 01:45:49,024
noticed.
It's a tremendously profound little 

2117
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:53,231
story,
you know,

2118
01:45:53,231 --> 01:45:57,220
because it's got echoes of the,
of the,

2119
01:45:57,221 --> 01:46:02,221
of Paradise and paradise lost in it.
The dragon and the dragon in the garden.

2120
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:03,933
But it's even better than that because 
it shows how dangerous it is to ignore 

2121
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:08,134
things.
And then it caps it off with the 

2122
01:46:10,181 --> 01:46:13,630
proposition that even if it's a bloody 
dragon,

2123
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:16,780
if you just admitted to there,
oh,

2124
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:17,913
and look at it,
there's a high probability that will 

2125
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,583
shrink to a manageable size.
You could hardly ask for a better 

2126
01:46:24,221 --> 01:46:24,851
ending.
Right.

2127
01:46:24,851 --> 01:46:25,960
Because you know,
you maybe they,

2128
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,750
something magic happens in the 
thunderbolt,

2129
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,040
gets rid of the dragon,
you know,

2130
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:31,570
it's,
it's the wrong kind of ending.

2131
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:32,261
This is,
yeah,

2132
01:46:32,261 --> 01:46:33,730
yeah,
you're stuck with a dragon.

2133
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:34,564
But you know,
maybe if you pay attention to the God 

2134
01:46:36,121 --> 01:46:39,340
damn thing,
then not only does it stay kitten sized,

2135
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:42,130
which isn't so bad,
but you can deal with it.

2136
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:43,630
And then there's something else.
It's like,

2137
01:46:43,631 --> 01:46:46,270
do you really want a household with no 
dragons?

2138
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,150
You know,
like imagine that because people,

2139
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,320
one of the things Dostoyevsky pointed 
out in,

2140
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:54,060
in his,
this was in notes from underground,

2141
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:59,061
which is a very powerful commentary on 
the foolishness of utopianism.

2142
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,410
You know,
so if you,

2143
01:47:01,411 --> 01:47:03,900
if you produced a utopia,
there wouldn't be any snakes in it,

2144
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:04,734
right?
Cause Utopia is where everything's 

2145
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:06,271
perfect.
It's like,

2146
01:47:06,271 --> 01:47:08,940
what the hell would you do in a utopia?
You know,

2147
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:11,160
you just sit there while everything was 
perfect.

2148
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,173
What we're seriously,
do you really want everything to be 

2149
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:18,180
perfect or do you want to be surrounded 
by manageable problems that you can make

2150
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:19,650
a meaningful contribution to?

2151
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,170
Well that seems better.
You know,

2152
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:23,004
so,
so there's something better than 

2153
01:47:24,181 --> 01:47:25,650
perfection.
It's weird.

2154
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,910
And what's better than perfection is 
manageable imperfection because it gives

2155
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:30,744
you something to do.
And so one of the things Dostoevsky 

2156
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:35,220
said,
this was back in the late 18 hundreds he

2157
01:47:35,221 --> 01:47:36,054
said,
utopia's will never work because people 

2158
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:38,814
are basically somewhat insane.
And if things were too perfect around 

2159
01:47:43,141 --> 01:47:43,974
them,
all the go do is go around and smash 

2160
01:47:46,891 --> 01:47:47,724
things until something interesting 
happens so that they had something to 

2161
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:51,750
do.
And that that seems to be,

2162
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:52,950
you know,
precisely right.

2163
01:47:52,951 --> 01:47:56,970
So the moral of the story here is don't 
ignore the Damn Dragon,

2164
01:47:56,971 --> 01:48:00,510
but there's more than that too.
It's like if you attend to it properly,

2165
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:01,344
if you have your eyes open,
then maybe the thing will stay 

2166
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:05,880
manageable.
And that's a lovely ending.

2167
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:07,110
I mean,
one of the things we know,

2168
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:07,944
for example,
if you're dealing with people who have 

2169
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:11,020
an anxiety disorder,
maybe they had an agoraphobic,

2170
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:13,200
you know,
they're very terrified.

2171
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,370
Often they're terrified of death,
but they're really terrified of is this,

2172
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:18,923
they're terrified that they'll have a 
painful and sudden sort of death in 

2173
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:23,124
public while people are watching 
themselves make a fool of themselves 

2174
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:28,800
while they're dying.
So there's two elements to it.

2175
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,040
There's the,
the,

2176
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:33,180
the fear of mortal vulnerability,
which is real.

2177
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,390
You know,
and sometimes people develop agoraphobic

2178
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:38,250
after they've had heart palpitations or 
something like that,

2179
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:40,200
you know?
And so there's dragon inside when think,

2180
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:40,951
well my God,
you know,

2181
01:48:40,951 --> 01:48:41,784
I might die.
And so then they go to the emergency 

2182
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:44,154
ward three or four times when they have 
panic attacks because they're thinking 

2183
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:48,630
they have heart attacks.
And what are they afraid of?

2184
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:50,250
Well,
they've just figured out that,

2185
01:48:50,251 --> 01:48:51,084
you know,
they might be walking down the street 

2186
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:54,300
one day and die and it's like,
yes,

2187
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:56,130
that could happen.
You know?

2188
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:58,440
And it's often people who are quite 
dependent,

2189
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:59,303
who've been dependent for much of their 
life and whose dependency relationships 

2190
01:49:03,331 --> 01:49:06,960
have been disrupted in some way that 
start to manifest the symptoms.

2191
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,003
But then if you dig a little bit deeper,
there are also concerned about the fact 

2192
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:11,034
that you know,
well it's something unbearable is 

2193
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:13,824
happening to them physiologically.
They'll expose themselves to the public 

2194
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:19,590
and so there'll be watched.
So it's kind of,

2195
01:49:19,591 --> 01:49:22,680
it's both social judgment plus mortality
fear,

2196
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:25,260
which is like the sum of all fears in 
some sense.

2197
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:30,360
If you treat agoraphobic people,
what's quite interesting is you actually

2198
01:49:30,361 --> 01:49:33,150
don't ever convince them that the world 
is more,

2199
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:35,730
is less dangerous than they have now 
realized.

2200
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:40,380
And the reason for that is it isn't less
dangerous than they've now realized.

2201
01:49:40,381 --> 01:49:42,360
They had just never realized that.
Right.

2202
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:43,194
And so they'd never really grown up.
And so then you expose them to 

2203
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:48,910
situations of danger and you might say,
well,

2204
01:49:48,911 --> 01:49:50,770
they habituate and become less 
frightened.

2205
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:53,170
It's like that isn't really what the 
evidence suggests.

2206
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:55,840
What the evidence suggests is that they 
become braver,

2207
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,440
which is way better because the world is
dangerous.

2208
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,340
And so,
you know,

2209
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:03,220
if I had to fix you to cure you of your 
anxiety disorder,

2210
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:03,791
I have to say,
look,

2211
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,380
everything's going to be all right.
It's like,

2212
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,161
no,
no,

2213
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:09,250
you've already figured out that 
everything is not going to be all right.

2214
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,050
And so then that question is,
well,

2215
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:14,320
once you figured out that everything is 
not going to be all right,

2216
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:17,830
what are you going to do?
And the answer to that is there might be

2217
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:18,664
a lot more to you than you think.
And it could easily be that regardless 

2218
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:22,900
of,
you know,

2219
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:26,080
how fragile you think you are and how 
little of you there is,

2220
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:28,450
that might just be wrong.
You know?

2221
01:50:28,451 --> 01:50:31,600
And if you exposed yourself to things 
that were challenging and frightening,

2222
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:32,434
you'd find out that the monster that you
have inside of you has real utility 

2223
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:37,390
because you're a lot more dangerous.

2224
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,223
And capable than you think.
And that is what people who are treated 

2225
01:50:40,811 --> 01:50:42,730
for anxiety disorders conclude.
They think,

2226
01:50:42,731 --> 01:50:43,750
oh,
you know,

2227
01:50:43,751 --> 01:50:45,680
so maybe you,
it's usually women that have,

2228
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:47,680
they have agoraphobic.
It's quite interesting.

2229
01:50:47,681 --> 01:50:51,400
So maybe you get the woman so she can 
now go on subways again and she can take

2230
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:52,234
the Boston,
she can go in elevators and then she 

2231
01:50:53,051 --> 01:50:54,730
goes home and have this big fight with 
her husband,

2232
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,580
which he hasn't done in 20 years because
she's being too timid,

2233
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,470
you know?
And so what she's learned is,

2234
01:50:59,471 --> 01:51:01,150
Hey,
I'm not as useless as I think.

2235
01:51:01,151 --> 01:51:03,490
I don't need as much protection as I 
thought I needed.

2236
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:04,324
I can stand up for myself and you know,
then she can take on other challenges 

2237
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:10,480
that she wouldn't have been able to take
on before because you've taught her that

2238
01:51:10,481 --> 01:51:11,314
she's brave.
That is possible to be brave and 

2239
01:51:13,661 --> 01:51:16,210
courageous and that if you do that,
it actually works.

2240
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:18,520
And that's really what happens at the 
end of the story.

2241
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:19,354
It's like,
you know,

2242
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:22,620
Mr Bixby finally thinks while there is,
you know,

2243
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:24,550
the problem here,
we should figure out what it is.

2244
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:28,180
And the kid says what it is and everyone
listens and all of a sudden poof.

2245
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:30,190
You know,
it's back to manageable proportions.

2246
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,820
And so one,
one of there aren't that many optimistic

2247
01:51:33,821 --> 01:51:34,654
things in philosophy or in psychology or
in life that are truly optimistic and 

2248
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:39,334
reliable.
But one of the things that is both 

2249
01:51:41,171 --> 01:51:44,920
optimistic and reliable is you might be 
a hell of a lot tougher than you think.

2250
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:46,690
And so you know,
when you're,

2251
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:47,524
when you're assaulted as you will be 
throughout your life by terrible things 

2252
01:51:51,161 --> 01:51:52,420
happening,
you know,

2253
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:53,254
for example,
at some point when some of you've 

2254
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,203
already done this,
you're going to have to deal say with 

2255
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:57,970
the death of a parent,
you know,

2256
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,680
you can do that,
you know,

2257
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:02,290
and in a way that's terrible.

2258
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:04,450
It's terrible that you can do that 
because you might think,

2259
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:05,770
well,
if he really loved your parent,

2260
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:06,910
you know,
and they die,

2261
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:07,744
then the logical and appropriate thing 
is to fall apart and never be put back 

2262
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:12,634
together because anything less would 
mean that you didn't have sufficient 

2263
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:15,880
love.
It's like,

2264
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:16,961
no,
well,

2265
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:18,640
you know,
you are a bit of a monster.

2266
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:20,463
And it turns out that you can lose a lot
more than you think and you can still 

2267
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:25,421
move forward.
And,

2268
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:28,660
and even more importantly,
it turns out that that's the right thing

2269
01:52:28,661 --> 01:52:29,494
to do.
Because if a tragedy strikes in your 

2270
01:52:31,361 --> 01:52:32,890
vicinity,
you know,

2271
01:52:32,891 --> 01:52:37,891
you can either lay down and fall victim 
to it and then add to the problem or you

2272
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:39,154
know,
you can stand up and take it and deal 

2273
01:52:40,721 --> 01:52:41,554
with it and you know,
maybe be a comfort to the other people 

2274
01:52:43,661 --> 01:52:48,500
around you that are also suffering the 
tragedy and you can move forward.

2275
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:50,390
You know,
and I saw this,

2276
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,190
I'll start with this and then we can 
take a break.

2277
01:52:52,191 --> 01:52:55,940
I had a client at one point who was 
afraid of very many things.

2278
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,043
For example,
she was a vegetarian and part of that 

2279
01:52:58,701 --> 01:52:59,534
was because she was terrified of meat.
So she wouldn't go into a supermarket 

2280
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:04,670
where the butcher shop rows are.
And you know,

2281
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:06,110
you can understand that.
It's like,

2282
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:07,520
well,
how can you do that?

2283
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:08,354
It's,
there's nothing but may Hammond carnage 

2284
01:53:09,681 --> 01:53:10,514
there,
you know,

2285
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,710
and you don't see it.
But she saw it,

2286
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,020
you know?
And so it terrified her.

2287
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:18,750
And so I take her to butcher shops now 
and then get her kind of used to it.

2288
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:21,230
And,
and she had a dream at one point,

2289
01:53:21,231 --> 01:53:23,840
and I can't remember the exact nature of
the dream,

2290
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:24,674
but it was something like this.
She saw a gypsy in the forest and the 

2291
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:28,724
Gypsy said to her that unless she 
learned how to work in a slaughter 

2292
01:53:30,691 --> 01:53:31,524
house,
she'd never finished her degree because 

2293
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:33,644
she had been doing her degree forever 
and she spent like 20 hours a day 

2294
01:53:35,781 --> 01:53:36,614
sleeping.

2295
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:39,380
So cause she didn't want to be conscious
because it was too burdensome.

2296
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:43,490
So we talked about that dream.
She was quite a remarkable dreamer.

2297
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:44,181
And I said,
well,

2298
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:45,610
you better think about that.
Like you,

2299
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,380
you need to do something that would push
you beyond your limits.

2300
01:53:48,381 --> 01:53:49,214
It's like you've not going to go to a 
slaughter house because I don't think I 

2301
01:53:50,901 --> 01:53:51,734
can arrange that,
but maybe you better think about what 

2302
01:53:53,481 --> 01:53:54,314
you could do.
And so she went away and she came back 

2303
01:53:56,571 --> 01:53:59,960
the next week and she said,
I think I want to go see an embalming.

2304
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,030
I thought,
oh well,

2305
01:54:02,031 --> 01:54:02,690
you know,
Ooh,

2306
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:04,490
I didn't really expect that.
So I thought,

2307
01:54:04,491 --> 01:54:05,530
okay,
well that's fine.

2308
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:08,120
I'll,
so I called up a few funeral parlors and

2309
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,343
um,
I told them what was going on and I 

2310
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:11,421
said,
you know,

2311
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:13,550
is it possible that I could bring one of
my clients there?

2312
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:16,730
And they said yes because they're kind 
of used to deep like they deal with this

2313
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:17,451
everyday,
right.

2314
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:21,680
These people deal with that every day.
Mazing and so,

2315
01:54:21,681 --> 01:54:22,514
you know,
I took her there and it was quite an 

2316
01:54:24,411 --> 01:54:27,140
exposure experience for me too.
You know,

2317
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:27,974
cause I'd never seen anything like that.
And I'm a little bit on the squeamish 

2318
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:31,880
side or maybe even a lot on the screen 
we side.

2319
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,253
So you know,
we were in there and there was the 

2320
01:54:34,671 --> 01:54:39,670
embalming table and the body was laid 
out on the table and you know,

2321
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:44,680
they were doing the prep work that they 
have to do in order to preserve the body

2322
01:54:45,681 --> 01:54:47,540
for,
for the funeral in later.

2323
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:49,580
And you know,
what's quite a gory process,

2324
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:52,160
all things considered,
there's a lot of fluid drainage and that

2325
01:54:52,161 --> 01:54:54,950
kind of thing.
And so she was standing beside me,

2326
01:54:54,951 --> 01:54:56,840
we were outside the room,
it was a small room.

2327
01:54:56,841 --> 01:54:57,674
And so we were outside looking through 
the door and she was basically doing 

2328
01:55:00,051 --> 01:55:00,884
this.

2329
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:04,793
And you know,
as she did that she'd look longer and 

2330
01:55:07,591 --> 01:55:08,520
longer,
you know?

2331
01:55:08,521 --> 01:55:10,560
And then finally I would say after about
20 minutes,

2332
01:55:10,561 --> 01:55:12,090
she didn't run away.
After about 20 minutes,

2333
01:55:12,091 --> 01:55:12,924
she could just watch and then she asked 
if she could go inside the room and you 

2334
01:55:15,781 --> 01:55:17,130
know,
the guy you said that was fine.

2335
01:55:17,131 --> 01:55:20,100
And then she asked if she could touch 
the body and like she did all of that,

2336
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:23,250
you know?
And I learned a lot that day too because

2337
01:55:23,251 --> 01:55:26,460
I talked to them about how funerals are 
arranged and all that sort of thing,

2338
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:29,270
which is knowledge you need to know even
though it's terrible knowledge,

2339
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,193
unless you want to be useless,
you need to know about that sort of 

2340
01:55:31,861 --> 01:55:34,650
thing.
And you know what was really interesting

2341
01:55:34,651 --> 01:55:39,651
about that was after that she had some 
calibration point for her fears,

2342
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:40,980
you know,
so she thinks,

2343
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:42,870
well I'm terrified at this,
therefore I can't.

2344
01:55:42,871 --> 01:55:45,240
Do people think that it's like,
well,

2345
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:46,470
then she could think,
well,

2346
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,333
this is nowhere near as bad is like 
going to the mortuary and watching 

2347
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:51,960
someone be embalmed.
So like,

2348
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:53,640
I did that,
I can do this.

2349
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:54,661
It's like,
yeah,

2350
01:55:54,661 --> 01:55:56,340
right.
Absolutely.

2351
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,700
You know,
you have to be a monster to stay alive.

2352
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:01,833
You,

2353
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:03,810
it's better to be conscious monster 
though,

2354
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:06,540
then an unconscious monster because then
you know,

2355
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:11,950
you're in control of the monster rather 
than the other way around.

2356
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:16,210
And it's necessary.
And part of what this book says is,

2357
01:56:16,211 --> 01:56:16,720
look,
you know,

2358
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:21,460
if you pay attention to terrible things,
you can shrink them to manageable size.

2359
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:24,250
They'll never go away,
but maybe you don't even want them to go

2360
01:56:24,251 --> 01:56:25,084
away,
but at least they'll shrink to 

2361
01:56:26,870 --> 01:56:28,490
manageable size.
And that,

2362
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:32,360
and what that tells you is just how 
bloody powerful it is to pay attention.

2363
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,610
So there's nothing more powerful than 
paying attention.

2364
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:39,370
Okay,
so let's take a break for a bit.

2365
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:41,530
15 minutes.
