1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,703
What

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,810
takes so long to to to talk about that 
dragon thing,

3
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:13,760
man took me a huge.
It took me a long,

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,870
long time to figure out how to separate 
that out from the other archetypes,

5
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,910
you know,
it was all right.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,803
Alright,
so I'm going to bang through a bunch of 

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,830
images here.
And so that's an l chemical

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,160
illustration.
It's really cool.

9
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,110
This thing,
it's weird.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,450
So you can see the,
the.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,523
Okay.
So you can think about this as a map of 

12
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,624
psychological development or you can 
think about this as a representation of 

13
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,500
how potential reveals itself in 
actuality.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,770
And it sort of works from the bottom up.
So the first thing you see there is that

15
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:09,171
container and if you notice the dragon 
is emitting sperm into this thing that's

16
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:13,650
like an aid.
So and then this egg thing has wings and

17
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,750
that's the round chaos I was talking 
about before.

18
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,350
It's the container of the.
You can think about it,

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,740
you can think about it as the container 
of what matters.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,043
And one of the ways of really thinking 
about organizing your framework so that 

21
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,394
these,
this way of understanding can work for 

22
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:39,000
you is to start thinking about the world
as being made out of what matters.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,700
And then you come into contact that now 
and then when you come into contact with

24
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:49,320
something that matters.
Now heidegger had an idea like this,

25
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,260
by the way.
Heidegger was very interested in.

26
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,094
He thought Western philosophy had gone 
off its tracks in some sense with with 

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,170
socrates,
which I think is unfair.

28
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,004
I think what happened is that western 
philosophy developed immensely in one 

29
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,950
direction and left some other 
directions,

30
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,784
not very developed.
So I don't think it's fair to say that 

31
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:08,904
socrates like derailed us,
but he helped us blow up and really a 

32
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,880
lot in one direction.
But heidegger said,

33
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,620
look,
not nothing that for awhile,

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,320
it's too rational.
It's too limited.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,393
And it,
it,

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,470
it,
it misses the central issue.

37
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:27,000
For heidegger,
the central issue is what is being now.

38
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,660
You might've heard about David chalmers.
Anybody ever heard of David Chalmers?

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,510
Okay,
so David chalmers got famous because he,

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,090
he made this question about 
consciousness.

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,090
He said there's the hard problem and the
easy problem of consciousness.

42
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,283
The hard problem is,
is why we are conscious because his 

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,790
notion,
which I think is,

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,120
I don't know what to make of it really,
I've never been that fond of it,

45
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:51,954
is that we could just as easily be 
totally deterministic zombies machines 

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,800
with no consciousness whatsoever.
It's like,

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,290
or we can't figure out why we couldn't 
be like that.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,450
You know,
we can build a robot.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,373
Hypothetically.
They did everything that we did that 

50
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,010
wasn't conscious now.
Maybe we couldn't,

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,480
but maybe we could.
So then what is consciousness and why is

52
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
it.
I think that's formulated that question 

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,283
is formulated improperly because I think
the hard question is way harder than 

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,473
trauma is hard question because the 
question of being is a harder question 

55
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,824
and the question of being is why is 
there anything at all and what is it 

56
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,700
that is.
And,

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,940
and I don't think that's distinguishable
from the,

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,833
from the hard question because in some 
sense there isn't anything without 

59
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,260
consciousness or that's one way of 
looking at things now.

60
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,300
So that's the container of what matters.
And then out of that,

61
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,643
that's very,
that's as generalized and abstract as 

62
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,400
you can possibly get.
It's,

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,470
it's what's similar across every 
instance of what matters.

64
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,304
Now,
heidegger also thought that our basic 

65
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,104
orientation to the world was one of care
because he was trying to qualify our 

66
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,570
experience,
what is our experience like?

67
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:13,260
Or he would say,
what is human being like?

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,940
And one of the things he said is,
well,

69
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:15,774
it seems to involve care.
We care about things or we don't care 

70
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:18,804
about them,
but,

71
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,810
but care is central to what it means to 
be human.

72
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,530
And so the,
the,

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,960
the contact between those,
that set of ideas in this is that one of

74
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:35,211
the aspects of being is that it matters.
Now,

75
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,730
sometimes it doesn't matter at all.
That's what it appears to be,

76
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:39,564
but it looks like we're still concerned 
about what matters were very hurt when 

77
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,620
nothing matters anymore.
Right?

78
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,454
And I would say part of what happens 
when nothing matters anymore is we're 

79
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:54,831
completely blinded by our map.
The map is blinding us completely to the

80
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:57,834
possibilities of being.
We spiral downward as a consequence of 

81
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,144
that.
So what's happening here is that what 

82
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:05,544
matters itself first manifest itself in 
this horrific dragon like form because 

83
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,900
it's so

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,753
because what you don't understand and 
what's anomalous to you is certainly 

85
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:23,821
capable of devouring you,
but it's paradoxical because,

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,893
and this is why these archetypes are 
also so complex because logical people 

87
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,400
always say everything is either one 
thing,

88
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,570
it's not itself and the opposite of 
itself at the same time,

89
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,740
but that's a like.
It's a prerequisite for,

90
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,290
for the world that you can apprehend 
logically.

91
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,090
But the problem with that is is it's 
wrong.

92
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,930
Lots of things are what they are and 
what and the opposite of what they are.

93
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,120
At the same time,
human beings are like that.

94
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,730
Like you can hate someone and love them 
at the same time,

95
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,564
no problem.
And they can be a hateable and the 

96
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,171
lovable object at exactly the same time.
And Life can be wonderful and tragic and

97
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,854
cruel at the same time.
So like so the archetypes are actually 

98
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,080
partly there.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,913
So to help us represent entities or 
experiences or classes have experienced 

100
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:18,530
that don't have a logical framework.
We can't separate the bloody things out.

101
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,110
They always confront us as a,
as a unity,

102
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,944
and so the dragon figure,
the predatory reptile is like that 

103
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:27,950
because you might say without the 
predatory reptiles,

104
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,680
there's no gold,
and then you might ask,

105
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,750
well,
is the reptile worth the gold?

106
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,190
It's like,
well,

107
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,890
maybe the gold is worth more than the 
reptile.

108
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,973
I mean,
that's basically what human beings are 

109
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:39,824
betting on.
We're betting that if we confront the 

110
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,184
unknown and we gathered the treasure for
gathered the information as a 

111
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:48,770
consequence,
that will help us beat the dragon.

112
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,810
There's,
there's the,

113
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,250
the gold is,
is more than the dragon,

114
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,990
better be,
you know,

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,200
but we're betting on that and that is 
not terror management.

116
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,750
That's a whole different idea.
It's a whole different idea.

117
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,840
It's not a delusion or an illusion.
It's a bet.

118
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,990
And part of the bed is,
this is a character guardian idea.

119
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,700
You don't know that's true,
but you could live as if it's true.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,050
And kierkegaard would say if you live as
if it's true,

121
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,063
then it might become true,
but you'll never know unless you try to 

122
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,770
live as if it's true.
That's the act of faith from a character

123
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:22,604
guardian perspective,
you have to a priority decide that that 

124
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:28,244
will work and then you have to follow it
and you have to be willing to see where 

125
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,594
it leads.
Now I talked about this in one of my 

126
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,900
other classes.
I think I finally got it right,

127
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,760
and in some ways this is something we're
thinking about because I think this is,

128
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,860
this is a critical choice that people 
make.

129
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
So here's two ways to use language.

130
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,160
Like let's say I'm going to pick up a 
girl in a bar.

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,520
All right?
So I have a goal in mind and the goal is

132
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:57,110
sort of the girls irrelevant to the goal
in so far as she could be another girl.

133
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,160
So it's,
it's,

134
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,153
it's,
it's a psychopathic goal in some ways 

135
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,930
because it really,
really,

136
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,540
because the individual doesn't matter if
it is,

137
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:05,861
I'm,
I'm,

138
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,810
I'm serious about that.
It's an so what I'm going to do,

139
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,763
say if I'm a pickup artist,
I follow these pickup artists online a 

140
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,884
because I'm so curious about their use 
of psychology and all they ever do is 

141
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,844
come up with.
It's like a whole horde of man talking 

142
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,530
about how to deceive and manipulate 
women.

143
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,220
It's extraordinarily interesting and 
extremely psychopathic.

144
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,900
And,
and also it's very,

145
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:27,591
very,
very,

146
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,424
very,
very unsophisticated and unskilled 

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,513
because what the guys are lumps 
basically and what they're trying to do 

148
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:37,760
is to acquire the veneer of 
sophistication.

149
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,160
And that's psychopathic.
So anyways,

150
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,100
that's my little spiel on pickup 
artists,

151
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,173
but they're very interesting.
So what they're doing is teaching their 

152
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,234
followers instrumental language.
It's so if you want to sleep with a 

153
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,230
girl,
here's how to do it,

154
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,890
here's how to manipulate her,
you know,

155
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:53,724
and they have a bunch of tricks,
like we're an expensive watch and dress 

156
00:08:56,281 --> 00:09:00,210
up and also don't just dress up,
dress up rich,

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,073
roughly speaking,
but also add something peculiar to your 

158
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,850
wardrobe.
Like something that really stands out as

159
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,743
somewhat odd.
They call that peacocking so that the 

160
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,700
girl can see that not only are you rich 
and successful,

161
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,534
but you've got that little bit of 
individuality that sets you apart from 

162
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,700
all the other rich and successful guys.
You know.

163
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,773
And so that's like,
I know Cyrus Horace combination 

164
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,204
basically,
but it's all bullshit because the guys 

165
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:23,364
aren't like that so it's so,
so and then they have all these little 

166
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:26,574
routines they use that are verbal 
routines and they have these guys they 

167
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:32,430
go to the bar with to help them with 
their little routines and it's like it's

168
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,940
completely what are they doing?
They're using language instrumentally.

169
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,283
They have a goal in mind,
which is their goal and they know that 

170
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,523
what the goal is and they know that the 
goal is right in so far as they're 

171
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,764
pursuing the goal and then they're 
willing to say anything to obtain that 

172
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:48,924
goal.

173
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,830
Now you think,
well,

174
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,020
I think that's the instrumental use of 
language.

175
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,060
What do you do if you're not using 
instrumental language?

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,913
That's interesting.
What you do is you try to communicate 

177
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,490
about the situation and your response to
the situation.

178
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,324
Whatever it is,
as clearly and accurately and 

179
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:15,731
articulately as you possibly can all the
time and see what happens.

180
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,313
That's a whole different thing because 
the proposition there is to the degree 

181
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:23,960
that you're

182
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,530
transforming your experience into 
reality,

183
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,543
into articulated reality.
The things that will follow from that 

184
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,300
will be the best things that can 
possibly be,

185
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,560
even if you don't know what they are.
So there's an openness in that approach.

186
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:43,394
It's like I'm going to conduct my 
relationship with person x in the most 

187
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,720
truthful possible manner and I'm going 
to see what happens.

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,733
And then I'm also going to assume that 
whatever happens is the best thing that 

189
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,944
could have happened because like,
how the hell do you know if it's the 

190
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:59,270
best thing that could've happened?
Maybe the person's all offended,

191
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,610
near rotated.
I've seen this with my clients a lot.

192
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,444
So especially with the agreeable one say
because they're all bent out of shape 

193
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,160
with resentment because they're not 
saying something,

194
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,350
you know,
and so and you know,

195
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,640
and because they're not saying 
something,

196
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,670
they're getting shepherded into some 
situation they don't want to be in.

197
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,504
Like maybe they are,
they have to go live with someone they 

198
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,480
don't want to live with and they don't 
want to,

199
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,543
you know,
express themselves because that'll hurt 

200
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,530
someone's feelings.
It's like,

201
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:22,364
so we talk about that in a bunch and we 
figured out how you could say what you 

202
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:28,940
actually think,
and usually what happens is they say,

203
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:32,030
I,
they get in a whole bunch of trouble and

204
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,680
then two days later the problem goes 
away,

205
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,103
so they're afraid to say what they're 
actually using silence instrumentally 

206
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,980
basically because their idea is,
I don't want to fight with you.

207
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,680
Well,
so how do I not fight with you?

208
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,420
I don't say anything that will upset 
you,

209
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,670
so I will upset you when exactly you 
know,

210
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,504
like if you,
if you're an intimate partner with 

211
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,860
someone and you see them doing something
stupid repeatedly,

212
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,870
that is going to lead them into a pit in
like a month or two months or a year,

213
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,430
five years.
You don't get to say,

214
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:07,264
well,
I'm not gonna fight with you just 

215
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:08,974
because that'll be trouble because 
sooner or later they're going to fall 

216
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,460
into a pit and that's going to be 
trouble too,

217
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,990
so you're not doing them any favors.
You're just for stalling the catastrophe

218
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,790
into the future.
It's not helpful.

219
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,440
We're instead,
you could say,

220
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,274
well,
here's how it looks to me and this is 

221
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,470
how it looks.

222
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,393
It looks to me like this is where this 
is going and you probably don't want to 

223
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,174
go there and even if you do,
I'm not going to aid and abet and then 

224
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:31,594
they're going to get all upset and 
they're going to tell you that you're 

225
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,024
interfering and that you're mean and 
cruel and that you can only see the bad 

226
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,284
in things.
And if you withstand all that and 

227
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,480
they're going to get really angry and 
stomp out,

228
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,314
and if you can withstand that,
then they're going to cry and tell you 

229
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:47,230
your son of a bitch and mean and that 
they never want to talk to you again.

230
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,480
And then they'll go home and think about
it.

231
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,070
Then a week later they'll come back and 
say,

232
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,560
I never want to see you again.
Probably not.

233
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,760
Or they'll say,
Geez,

234
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:55,594
you know,
I thought about that and what you said 

235
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:57,994
made sense and I'm going to do.
I'm going to try to do something about 

236
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,060
it.
So.

237
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,810
But you have to decide to begin with 
whether or not you,

238
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,270
whether or not you're willing to risk 
the consequences of the truth.

239
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,970
And that doesn't mean you get to use the
truth as a weapon.

240
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,740
I mean,
that's not truthful.

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,980
You can use the truth as a weapon.
You know,

242
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,040
if you see someone who's

243
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,920
perhaps not as attractive as they could 
be,

244
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,370
you could say your,
your rather ugly,

245
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,560
you know,
which in some senses of the truth,

246
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,060
it's a,
it's a statement about,

247
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,960
but it's not the truth at all.
Because for it to be the truth,

248
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:34,794
it has to be embedded.
What it really has to be is embedded in 

249
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:41,961
the ocirus horace pyramid.
You know what your audience has to serve

250
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,260
the entire function of that integrated 
unit.

251
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,870
It has to serve tradition.
It has to serve enlightenment.

252
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,853
It has to serve vision.
And if it isn't doing any of those 

253
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,670
things,
it's not the truth.

254
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
Even if it's the truth in this local 
tiny slice,

255
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,860
you know I,
I just told you the truth.

256
00:13:58,861 --> 00:13:59,694
It's like,
no,

257
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,730
you didn't.
You took a little fragment of what could

258
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:06,480
be interpreted to be the truth and you 
turned it into a bat and then you hit me

259
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:07,314
with the bat and then you defended 
yourself by a false argument that's 

260
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,780
claiming that when you use the truth and
the local manner like that,

261
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,730
you're actually moral.
That's right.

262
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,564
That's not true.
It's incredibly deceptive because you 

263
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,404
know the best way to deceive someone.
It's to sort of tell them the truth and 

264
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:24,144
then you not only you can really get the
person than a because not only are you 

265
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,254
innocent because you've told the truth,
they are even more guilty because 

266
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,310
they're too weak to handle the truth.
So man,

267
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,290
you can really wall up someone with 
that.

268
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,124
So anyways,

269
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,723
that's the container of what matters.
And at first manifests itself in this 

270
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,910
potentially horrific form.
And so then the question is,

271
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,600
well,
are you willing,

272
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,850
willing to confront that and in what way
are you willing to confront it?

273
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,310
And then out of that arises at the very 
top.

274
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,050
That's illumination.
You know,

275
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,110
it's maybe the night first.
I think that's a crescent moon,

276
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,990
although I might be wrong about that.
I think it's a crescent moon.

277
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,233
What arises out of that is the contents 
of the unconsciousness and then finally 

278
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,290
illumination,
you know,

279
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,780
so it's like horace arising from the 
depths.

280
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,614
It's a story of transformation.
The transformation of what matters into 

281
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,560
illumination.
That's what that means.

282
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,613
So this is Jonah and what happened to 
Jonah roughly speaking is that God told 

283
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,100
him he was supposed to go somewhere and 
he didn't want to go there.

284
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,934
And so he got on a boat and then there 
was a big storm and none of the sailors 

285
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,100
knew why the storm came up.
And Jonah finally said,

286
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:43,934
well,
it's probably my fault because God told 

287
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,940
me to go do something and I didn't want 
to do it.

288
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,750
So God sent the storm.
So they take John and they throw him off

289
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,900
the boat,
you know,

290
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:52,734
and he,
he's okay with that because it's his 

291
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:54,644
fault.
And then the waters calm and then this 

292
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,174
big whale comes up and swallows them and
then it spits them out on the ground 

293
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,970
three days later,
roughly speaking.

294
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,180
So what's the idea there?
Well,

295
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,170
it's a complicated one.
The first idea is that if you're cold,

296
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,074
you better listen.

297
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,870
That's the first idea.
And you know people,

298
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,090
modern people never believe that they're
called to do anything,

299
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,610
but that's because they're not very 
bright and they don't pay any attention.

300
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,060
And you know perfectly well that you're 
called to do things because now and then

301
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:24,860
you know that you should have said 
something.

302
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,550
You know it right.
Sometimes you don't know should have you

303
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:32,390
said something should have united said 
something you don't know so fine.

304
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,224
You're not culpable,
but lots of times you bloody well know 

305
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:35,894
that you should have done something or 
you should have said something or you 

306
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:38,534
shouldn't have done something or you 
shouldn't have said something and you 

307
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:43,820
went ahead and did it anyways.
Well,

308
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,570
part of the moral of this story is 
beware of doing such things.

309
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,660
You know,
if you don't listen,

310
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,210
something will come up from the depths 
and swallow you.

311
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,020
And if you're lucky,
it'll spit you back up three days later.

312
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,854
But it's not necessary that it will.
It might just swallow you and that will 

313
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,600
be the end of that.
You know,

314
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,250
when I've seen people who are tangled up
in such trouble,

315
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,370
they don't have enough life left to fix 
it and it's usually the consequence of,

316
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,870
well,
I've tried to calculate it.

317
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,930
I think it's possible to make 100 bad 
decisions a day,

318
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,483
maybe more,
but certainly a hundred and those 

319
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,220
hundred bad decisions are usually sins 
of omission.

320
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,700
They're usually things that you know you
should do and then you just don't.

321
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,460
So there are things you should explore 
and you don't.

322
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,440
There are things that you should say 
that you don't.

323
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,200
There are obligations that you should 
undertake and you don't.

324
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,040
So it's passive avoidance in some sense.
It's willful blindness.

325
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,310
Just like the kind of willful blindness 
that doomed.

326
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh Cyrus.
So it's not active repression,

327
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,350
it's just failure to engage when you 
know you should.

328
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,423
Okay.
You do that at a hundred times in a day 

329
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:52,290
and it's like seven in a week and it's 
3000 in a month roughly speaking,

330
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,124
and it's 36,000
in a year and then you do that for 10 

331
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,120
years.
That's 360,000,

332
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:02,121
so then you have 360,000
things lying around you that you have to

333
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,004
fix and the problem is while you would 
even fix one of those things when they 

334
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,890
popped up,
and so that's how Taya Matt Reappears,

335
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,383
right?
There's little monsters they pop up and 

336
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,350
you could whack them with a hammer like 
whackable,

337
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:21,351
no problem if you want to,
but if you don't do that for 360,000

338
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,584
decisions,
then they all aggregate into this 

339
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,744
looming chaos monster and the 
probability that that thing's going to 

340
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:28,794
eat us or that you're going to live in 
its belly because that's where you end 

341
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,514
up.
It's a very bad idea and it's often the 

342
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:39,664
case that people just don't have enough 
time and energy left or willpower or 

343
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:46,740
character by that time because they're 
destroying their own character there.

344
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,340
They've had it.
You cannot help them.

345
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:50,320
You cannot fix it.
They're done.

346
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,540
They can't be rescued from hell.

347
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,461
Oh,
that's easy.

348
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,480
It's like,
it's like,

349
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,314
it's like,
um,

350
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,590
remember I told you about those 
experiments with the married couples,

351
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,993
the ones that are going to get divorced,
they walk into the little bed and 

352
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,980
breakfast and it's high deer and with 
the kind of no,

353
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,780
no ice smile.
It's like,

354
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,280
that's a predatory smile.
So like I kinda like you,

355
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,340
but these are really teeth and there for
eating,

356
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,710
you know,
really it's not pleasant.

357
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,900
And so they're interacting with each 
other.

358
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,760
Both of them are really nice,
but they're not,

359
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:24,594
they're not nice at all.
They're carnivorous rate to the damn 

360
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,330
core.
And so on the surface it's all roses and

361
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:34,350
sunshine and like a little inch below.
It's all like their,

362
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,373
like if you could see their unconscious,
you'd see two people with their hands 

363
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,134
around each other's throat and their 
body knows that because up go to the 

364
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:44,880
cortisol,
up goes to the heart rate.

365
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,310
They're sweating away,
you know,

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,690
that's the belly of the beast.
That's what that is.

367
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,130
And your body,
it's smart,

368
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,860
it knows where you are.
You're,

369
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,030
you know,
you can ignore it,

370
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,410
which you do.
You know,

371
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,340
it's like,
oh,

372
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,020
this isn't too bad.
It's like,

373
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:01,441
yeah,
it's,

374
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,670
it is.
It's really bad.

375
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,750
It's really,
really,

376
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,030
really bad,
and you do that long enough.

377
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:08,580
It's like good luck for you.
You know you've,

378
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,533
you've polluted your psyche and your 
surroundings to such a degree that you 

379
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:16,644
can't fix it and it,
it gets worse than that because if you 

380
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,440
stay there long enough,
you won't even want to fix it.

381
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,330
You'll be so angry at yourself or the 
other person that you're going to try as

382
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:28,164
hard as you can to do everything you 
possibly can to make it as bad as you 

383
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:32,964
possibly can.
And since you have virtually an 

384
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:38,610
unlimited imagination for evil,
it can get really bad.

385
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,230
So when you get into a self sustaining 
spiral at some point,

386
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,600
and that's a,
that's a hellish descent,

387
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,870
and the reason that hell is,
is because no matter how bad it is,

388
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,850
there's some damn devious,
nasty,

389
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,684
horrible little thing that you can do 
that you will do that will make it 

390
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,190
worse.
So

391
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,550
you know,
people who think that hell isn't real,

392
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,500
they are just not paying any attention 
at all.

393
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,870
It's plenty real.
So there's some other representations of

394
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:11,160
Jonah.
Luckily he got back up.

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,033
Same idea that wouldn't be in such a 
spectacularly successful movie if it 

396
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:28,220
wasn't archetipal to the core and it,
it just relates and archetipal tail.

397
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,030
So it's brave man against horrific beast
from the depths Greek.

398
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,343
So those are the Greeks going after the 
hydro and you see the circle at the 

399
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,540
bottom of the hydro there.
That's like a symbol of infinity.

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,780
And so what did the Greeks doing?
They're tackling infinity.

401
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,450
Well that is what the Greeks did.
That's why we still remember them.

402
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,880
It's like those characters,
they were tough people,

403
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,743
man.
There was something about them that was 

404
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,970
truly remarkable.
You know,

405
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,550
there was only 25,000
people in Athens,

406
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,140
so I don't know what was up with them,
but they certainly got this part right.

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,090
I guess maybe what was up with them is 
that's how they thought of themselves.

408
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,340
You know,
it's like they're not running away.

409
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,050
You know,
you could make a pretty strong case that

410
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,970
if a seven headed snake

411
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,420
with infinite length came rolling 
towards you,

412
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:23,190
it's time to head for the hills,
right?

413
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,000
Not like stand there with your bronze 
ax.

414
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,690
Is there any things like that?

415
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,680
Sure.
But it wasn't conscious.

416
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,890
It was mimic mimicry,
which is how you do it too.

417
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,120
You know,
you don't go to a movie,

418
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,540
go iron man,
Iron Mans mythological to the core,

419
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,540
especially the avengers movie.
It had a brilliant mythological feet and

420
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,383
uh,
you don't go there and watch iron man 

421
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,090
and then come out and say,
well,

422
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,924
let's decode iron man into his 
behavioral micro elements and 

423
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,570
incorporate those.
You don't do that.

424
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,870
You're gripped by it.
You're gripped by it.

425
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,330
And the transmission of information is 
at a level that's below articulation.

426
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,253
It's images stick.
So maybe it's modifying the structure 

427
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,850
of,
of the contents of your right hemisphere

428
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,550
who god only knows.
It's,

429
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,600
it's embodied,
you know,

430
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,190
that's why you know,
what happens.

431
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:30,340
You take a kid out to see a superman 
movie and then you bring them home.

432
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:31,174
What do they want to do?
They want to put on a little Superman 

433
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,470
Cape and wander around being superman,
you know,

434
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,543
and that's the level at which the 
information is being transmitted so 

435
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:40,541
that,
well,

436
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,374
what superman,
like what will play that out and to the 

437
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,950
degree that you can play it out.

438
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,213
Then the superman element in so far as 
you can mimic it now becomes part of 

439
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:55,610
your behavioral repertoire.
So did they know what they were doing?

440
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,433
Depends on what you mean by no.
Could they fully articulate what they 

441
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:01,970
were doing?
No,

442
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,560
but neither can we.
So that's what they knew.

443
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,833
Like they weren't taking something they 
knew in an articulated form and saying 

444
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,480
let's represent it as a hydro and a 
hero.

445
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,413
It's completely the other way around.
It's like we don't know what the hell 

446
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:16,694
we're doing,
but it seems sort of like a guy with a 

447
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,750
bronze ax attacking a snake.
It's like,

448
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,100
what kind of snake?
Well,

449
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,470
it's an infinite snake with many heads,
you know?

450
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,270
And that would have been a work of 
imagination.

451
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,700
Maybe.
Maybe conscious imagination,

452
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,534
you know,
like because those are artistic 

453
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:33,770
productions definitely.
But they're products of fantasy.

454
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,830
So this chaos monster dragon breaks 
itself into two things.

455
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,813
That's the initial differentiation.
So it breaks itself into the great 

456
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:47,330
father and the great mother.
So that's the emergent.

457
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:51,890
So it's the great mother in some sense 
emerges first and a great father second.

458
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:52,724
Although you can't really say that like 
the way the myths work is that three 

459
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,330
things emerge at the same time,
the great mother,

460
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,200
so that's kind of the unknown.
As you confronted and the great father,

461
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,560
which is you as a reader and then the 
hero,

462
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:07,394
which is you as an active agent.
You might say one of those proceeds the 

463
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,170
other,
but that isn't how it works in the myths

464
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:14,060
that just says no matter what,
soon as things splint,

465
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:17,000
that's what they split into.
There has to be something,

466
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,983
there has to be the interpretation of 
something and there has to be the 

467
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:23,324
interpreter.

468
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,210
Those are the fundamental elements of 
being.

469
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,790
And so it's an.
It's an idea,

470
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:32,420
the fundamental elements of being are 
there is a pool of information.

471
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,850
There's a reader of the information,
so that would be,

472
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,840
whoa,
oh cyrus,

473
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:38,090
roughly speaking.
And then there's a reader,

474
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,610
and so think about what happens when 
you're reading a book,

475
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,321
you know,
you might say,

476
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,310
well,
where's the book?

477
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,971
And you'd say,
well,

478
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:47,930
here's the book.
It's this little chunk of wood fiber.

479
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,040
It's like,
well no,

480
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,680
that's what your visual system deludes 
you into thinking when you're using it.

481
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,860
That's not the book at all.
The book contains patterns.

482
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:03,260
It contains representations of 
behavioral patterns and the way that you

483
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,190
interpret those behavioral patterns is 
by using the reader that's in your head,

484
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,024
which is really that structure,
that hierarchical structure that I 

485
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,913
talked about.
Because if you didn't have that in your 

486
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,240
damn had,
you couldn't understand the book.

487
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,283
Because the only thing that,
like if you and I are talking and we're 

488
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:21,500
communicating,
there's a lot we have to agree on.

489
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,410
Before we could even say anything about 
which we might disagree.

490
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,170
So if I'm writing a book for you people,
as,

491
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,093
as the readers,
what I have to do is assume a bunch of 

492
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,244
things that you know,
because then I don't have to say those 

493
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:36,090
things because it would take an infinite
amount of time.

494
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:36,924
Just say everything that I need to say,
so I have to assume that there's a 

495
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:39,974
trillion things I don't have to say 
because I already know that you know 

496
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,630
them and so then I can play at the 
fringes with those things.

497
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:50,631
So for example,
I can lay out a story about my character

498
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,400
becoming angry and I don't have to like 
tell you,

499
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,573
you know,
while we can tell he's angry because 

500
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,010
it's,
his brow is furrowed and you know,

501
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,650
he's starting to sweat and there's a bad
taste in his mouth and if you're angry,

502
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,700
that's how you feel.

503
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,490
And because you already knew all that.
So I don't have to bother with that.

504
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,800
I can just say,
you know,

505
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:08,820
like,
just set up the situation and Poof,

506
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,830
you know what anger means.
[inaudible] means you know,

507
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,300
what love means,
etc.

508
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,153
Etc.
So that's why thE reader has to be 

509
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,110
there.
And the thing to read,

510
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,870
sorry,
the,

511
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,710
the structure,
the interpreter has to be there.

512
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,850
And the thing that's doing the 
interpreter interpretation and the thing

513
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,460
that's being interpreted have to all 
come out at the same time.

514
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,410
Poof.
And that'S the,

515
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,320
the hero.
the great mother and the great father,

516
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,480
so that's how they pop out.
Now,

517
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,200
let me show you some cool things.
There they are.

518
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Now.
Students sent me the one on the left.

519
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,320
That's an ancient chinese representation
and then that one's great.

520
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,660
It's so cool.
Look at that.

521
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,260
You have the dragon in the background,
the snake with the knot and its tail.

522
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,450
That's ancient greek.
ThAt and it's.

523
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,323
It's chinese.
It's a very old chinese representation 

524
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,960
and out of the snake pops the divine 
parents.

525
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,430
Well,
why is that?

526
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,293
Well,
it's partly because the one of the 

527
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,414
primary things that emerges out of 
undifferentiated reality for human 

528
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:13,080
beings is the male and the female,
the father and the mother.

529
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,360
I mean that's the first things you come 
into contact with.

530
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,420
roughly speaking,
when you emerge out of the void,

531
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,520
and that's archetipal.
We know who our father is,

532
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:24,930
we know who her mother is.
It's like that's the.

533
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,170
That differentiation of the genders.

534
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,970
What time is it?
yeah.

535
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,063
Okay.

536
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,750
Okay,
well let's leave it there.

537
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,703
That's good.
Now we've gone into the great mother in 

538
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:38,704
the great father and I'm going to show 
you their symbolic representation and 

539
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:44,830
they're positive because one of the 
things that happens is you get the great

540
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:45,664
mother and the great father pop up and 
then the next thing is that they 

541
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:48,694
differentiate again and they 
differentiate into positive mother and 

542
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:54,370
negative mother and paused a father,
a negative father,

543
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,413
and then out,
and then at the same time the cross the 

544
00:28:58,271 --> 00:28:59,104
product of those two things,
which is the hero that also emerges and 

545
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:05,170
it's differentiates into the hero and 
the adversary.

546
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,350
And so then you have.
You have enough.

547
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:10,184
At that point you have enough different 
differentiation at that point in terms 

548
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:15,980
of representation that you can basically
encapsulate the whole world.

549
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,820
And so that's at the base of our 
conceptual structures.
