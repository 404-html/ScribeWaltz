1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,540
All right.
Whenever someone just drops.

2
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,150
What exactly that?

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,910
So we stopped last week.

4
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,203
Yeah.

5
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,623
Just before I start talking about Stalin
and Mao in one of the things that 

6
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:48,070
happened in the 20th century.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,970
Yeah.

8
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,803
Was that,
or what appeared to happen was that as 

9
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,164
soon as the classical religious 
substructures in the west became 

10
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:02,174
sufficiently undermine that they were 
very rapidly replaced with political 

11
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:09,944
utopian dreams and what appeared to 
occur as a consequence of that was 

12
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:20,540
generally nothing but disaster.

13
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:25,850
Okay.

14
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,560
It's not exactly a straight forward 
matter to figure out why.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,573
Okay.

16
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,453
I think the case of communism is 
probably the most instructive because 

17
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,540
it's the most complex.
You know,

18
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,940
you still see,
it's kind of interesting on the campus,

19
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:48,560
you still see people handing out the 
Communist newspaper from time to time.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
You know,
which I think is very interesting 

21
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:54,020
because if there were Nazis out there 
handing out Nazi newspapers,

22
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,980
there would be hell to pay.
You know?

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,580
So why there isn't held to pay when you 
see communists sanding out,

24
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,470
communist newspapers is not self 
evident.

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Given that the catastrophic catastrophic
outcome of Communist ideology was,

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,983
I don't see how you can make the case 
that it was any less devastating than 

27
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,404
what happened in Nazi Germany.
I've been trying to puzzle that out for 

28
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:24,754
a long time.
Why people have different attitudes to 

29
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,663
towards those two different utopian 
catastrophes and I think there's two 

30
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,560
reasons.
I think the first one is,

31
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:38,561
is that the Nazi movement was definitely
not universalist,

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,053
right?
It was for a certain kind of person and 

33
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,324
that was that.
So it was for Ariens and not for the 

34
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,334
world,
whereas the communist ideology promised 

35
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,970
like a universal,
like universal,

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,313
and so it's conceivable that it appears 
and appeared in still appears more 

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,630
fundamentally benevolent.

38
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.
Then the other interesting twist I think

39
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:21,554
is that,

40
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,270
okay,

41
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,170
the radical left wing philosophies were 
very appealing to intellectuals,

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,330
which I wouldn't say that was so true 
about the fascist in Germany.

43
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,643
Now I wouldn't,
I would also not say that the academics 

44
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:38,804
in Germany and in other countries 
comported themselves with a tremendous 

45
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,770
amount of courage when the fascist came 
to power,

46
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,923
but for one reason or another the 
communist propositions appeared to be 

47
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:52,844
more acceptable and even,
and even not only acceptable but 

48
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,334
attractive to people who to academics 
and intellectuals who are on the left 

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,530
now.
When George Orwell wrote a bolt down and

50
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,364
I think he wrote more effectively about 
that than anyone else because he was 

51
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,604
also,
he was sort of a socialist by 

52
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:21,340
inclination even though he was an 
Aristocrat by birth and,

53
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,510
and he had a fair bit of sympathy for 
the working class,

54
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,090
let's say.
Even though he had a very difficult time

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,690
spending time with people from the 
working class,

56
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,543
he said that he had to overcome a fair 
bit of class based discussed before he 

57
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:50,041
could truly consider himself an advocate
for the working class.

58
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,230
And he took some pretty extreme steps 
because he,

59
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,950
he traveled around Europe as a tramp 
more or less and also worked in very low

60
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,381
status jobs including a stint as a 
basically a dishwasher,

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,500
low level kitchen employee in 
restaurants in,

62
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,923
in Paris.
And one of the things that are well set 

63
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:14,674
about

64
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,143
the pine of Socialists or the kind of 
left wing thinkers that he meant in met 

65
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,604
in Europe who seemed to have nothing to 
do whatsoever with the working class 

66
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,883
except from an intellectual perspective,
is that they were driven in large part 

67
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:33,764
by resentment.
And so one of the things that are well 

68
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:41,180
said about this particular kind of left 
wing individual,

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,253
so that would be the privileged 
intellectual left wing who's actually 

70
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,304
part of the ruling class.
Whether or not they would like to admit 

71
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:54,071
it was that they weren't driven so much 
by sympathy for the poor as they were by

72
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:58,190
hatred for the rich,
which is a completely phenomena.

73
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,103
And one of the things that I wrote about
in my introduction to maps of meaning 

74
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:10,100
was my experiences working with the New 
Democratic Party in Alberta when I was a

75
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:10,934
kid.
You know I was about are between about 

76
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,780
14 and 17 or 14 and 18 I guess,
and I was,

77
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,990
I had privileged access in some ways 
because the person who was the member of

78
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,850
the Legislative Assembly for our writing
was the only member of the opposition in

79
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:30,020
Alberta at that time.

80
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,970
If I remember correctly,
it was all conservatives and one NDP or,

81
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,073
and he was in our writing even though I 
wouldn't say our writing was left wing 

82
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,934
by propensity,
it's just that people where I lived 

83
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,430
actually admired this guy.
He was leader of the NDP,

84
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,030
he was a good guy and the reason they 
were voting for him was because he was a

85
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,980
good guy.
It certainly wasn't because he was in,

86
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,023
he was a member of the NDP,
and so in the few years that I was 

87
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,910
involved with the NDP,
I got to know,

88
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,493
I got to know him quite well and his 
wife and then peripherally I got to 

89
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:04,454
observe the sorts of things they were 
doing out provincial conventions or 

90
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,950
national conventions and that sort of 
thing with,

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
because when those conventions came up,
he would be associating with some of the

92
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,190
premier's of provinces at that time,
like Roy Romer now and and the leader,

93
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,334
ed broadbent,
and then a number of the leaders of the 

94
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,790
sort of national labor unions,
and it was pretty interesting to observe

95
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,624
them because a lot of them were 
committed people and they did have the 

96
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:39,140
interests of the working class person in
mind,

97
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,033
I would say.

98
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,820
But then when I was just associating 
with the party hacks,

99
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:51,680
I suppose in general it was a whole 
different issue because most of them,

100
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,400
as far as I could tell,
weren't driven by care.

101
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,220
They were driven by resentment and,

102
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,313
okay.

103
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,683
My experience as a clinical psychologist
has taught me that the two most 

104
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,520
pathological emotions are the two most 
destructive emotions.

105
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,354
I think you can,
you can or attitudes cause I'm not sure 

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,860
they're exactly emotions is resentment 
and arrogance

107
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,123
and resentment seems to be something 
like the observation that the world is 

108
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,810
not a fair place,
but worse than that,

109
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:29,644
that it's not a fair place in a manner 
that's particularly unfair to you 

110
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,770
because it's obvious that the world 
isn't a fair place.

111
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,150
It's predicated,
you know,

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,410
the world is a tragic place and there's 
justice.

113
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,143
If there's any justice,
it's imperfect justice and you might 

114
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,154
think,
well how can you not be resentful under 

115
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,790
those conditions?
But,

116
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,870
and I think that's a powerful argument.
How can you not are a powerful question.

117
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:00,090
How can you not be resentful under those
conditions?

118
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,870
But I can tell you that all it does is 
make it worse.

119
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,603
And it's an interesting,
it's very interesting form of worse 

120
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,144
because people justify their resentment 
against the system or against being 

121
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:14,874
itself for that matter by rationalizing 
to themselves the fact that it's so 

122
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,143
clearly on just that that having any 
admiration or support for it verges on 

123
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,184
the pathological.
But the problem with that is that as 

124
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,544
soon as you adopt that attitude,
you start to act in ways that make the 

125
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:39,270
conditions that you were originally 
objecting to much worse.

126
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,170
So then instead of being at least 
neutral with regards to the problem,

127
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,730
you're accelerating and strengthening 
the original issue.

128
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,893
And I really think that's true with 
resentment and nature actually wrote a 

129
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,484
fair bit about resentment.
He called it [inaudible] tomorrow I 

130
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,660
think is if,
if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

131
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,613
Yes.

132
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,613
I'm wondering like that,
but I'm wondering how you would and 

133
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,593
maybe areas that like if someone feels 
like the world doesn't get them 

134
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,840
anything,
everything's worth for them.

135
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,793
Like,
how do you reframe that or like help 

136
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,630
them understand that like,
yes,

137
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,473
the world isn't fair,
but like not so much worse for you than 

138
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:31,510
for any other how to,
how to get around that.

139
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,920
How would you get around that with the 
patient?

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Well,
it's a good question because you know,

141
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,234
that definitely happens is that's a 
problem in psychotherapy is you often 

142
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,950
have someone who has a chip on their 
shoulder.

143
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,230
It just one way of thinking about it,
do you know?

144
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,633
And part of it is to disabuse them of 
the notion that anyone escapes from 

145
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,210
that.
You know,

146
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:53,044
because one of the,
one of the things that I think drives 

147
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:56,614
class hatred in so far is that still a 
relevant phenomena and I think it's 

148
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:00,574
still quite relevant,
is that people who people have strange 

149
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:07,180
ideas about who's rich and who's poor.
First of all,

150
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:08,014
especially in North America because most
North Americans think that anybody who 

151
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,070
has more money than them is rich,
right?

152
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,904
When the fact of the matter is that 
everybody in North America is rich 

153
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:18,994
beyond belief compared to any reasonable
historical standard and that almost all 

154
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:25,150
the problems that can be solved with 
money,

155
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,110
like with magnitude of money have 
already been solved in North America.

156
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,000
There's still problems of relative 
poverty,

157
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,150
but that's a completely different issue.
Relative poverty in absolute poverty are

158
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:38,470
not the same problem because relative 
poverty has to do with dominance,

159
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,304
hierarchy position and absolute poverty 
has to do with privation and the 

160
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:44,344
argument that there are people in North 
America who are in privation because 

161
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:48,484
they don't have money.
I think that's an incredibly 

162
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,760
unsophisticated and weak argument.
They might in privation,

163
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,440
but the probability that that's because 
they don't have money or the probability

164
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,660
that money would six that is virtually 
zero.

165
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,820
So for example,
if you give,

166
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,743
I've had plenty of clients in my 
practice and the best times of their 

167
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,350
lives were when they had no money 
because as soon as they had any money,

168
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,880
man,
they are in serious trouble.

169
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,500
The,
those were often people who are addicted

170
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,640
to something or other,
you know,

171
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,990
like alcohol or cocaine.

172
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,880
As soon as they got their unemployment 
check or,

173
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,960
or even their employment check for that 
matter,

174
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:25,390
they were gone for like four days,
you know,

175
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,090
and they spent every bloody cent of it.
And that was the end of that.

176
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,880
And giving them more money was not going
to fix the problem.

177
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,373
And there's lots of people for whom 
having more money would not fix their 

178
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:37,564
problem at all.
It's not that easy to figure out how to 

179
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,384
do sensible things with money.
And it also makes you a target for 

180
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,240
people to take advantage of you 
virtually instantaneously.

181
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,613
You know?
So the idea that the kind of poverty 

182
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,854
that characterizes North America is 
there because some people don't have 

183
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:53,920
money.
It's just,

184
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,580
that's just soul.
It's so unsophisticated assessment.

185
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,414
First of all,
it assumes that poverty is homogenous 

186
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,400
and it's by no means homogenous.
You know,

187
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,234
I also grew up with working class kids 
and hardly any of them graduated from 

188
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,344
high school.

189
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
Virtually none of them went to 
university.

190
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,770
A lot of them went off to work in the 
oil rigs,

191
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,460
which was,
you know,

192
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,080
pretty damn spectacular from a 
perspective of money.

193
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,090
They never had any money.
They spent it all,

194
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,830
you know,
they'd go work in the Bush for two weeks

195
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:23,380
and they'd come out for four days or 
five days at spend,

196
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,000
you know,
$4,000

197
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,560
in the bars.
And that was the end of that.

198
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,210
And then they were back in the oil rigs.
You know,

199
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
maybe they'd buy a car after working for
a year or two,

200
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,990
but they usually,
you know,

201
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,883
and it lost their license because they 
were driving while impaired or wrap the 

202
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,930
thing around a tree or something like 
that.

203
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:38,764
There was no,
the money in some sense had almost no 

204
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,424
utility for them because money isn't all
that useful unless you know what to do 

205
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:45,904
with it.

206
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,370
So,
so back to the resentment issue,

207
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,204
you know,
orwell's comment on and it's like a 

208
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:52,924
psychoanalytic comment in some sense.
One of the things the psych that 

209
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,343
psychoanalytic thought is really,
really useful for is that it always 

210
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:02,470
makes you ask a question,
which is where's the other half?

211
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,460
So if someone says,
I'm doing this and here's,

212
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,790
and I'm doing it for good reasons and 
I'm a good person,

213
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,090
then the psychoanalytic,
the psychoanalyst always asks,

214
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,571
well,
okay,

215
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,860
where's the,
where's the,

216
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,600
where's the other half of that?
Like is it projected onto someone else,

217
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,434
which is almost always the case,
or is it lurking around underneath 

218
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,900
causing some sort of trouble that the 
person doesn't want to admit to?

219
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,130
Well,
that's very,

220
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,930
very frequently the case as well.
And so orwell's diagnosis for,

221
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,510
um,
the moral insufficiency of,

222
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,330
okay,

223
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,163
leftwing socialists Utopian left wing 
socialists in the United Kingdom was 

224
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,414
that they were just resentful,
especially the intellectuals and the 

225
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:50,774
reason they were resentful because even 
though they were smart and privileged 

226
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:57,320
and well-placed,
say in universities and so on,

227
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,453
there were lots of people around who had
more money in theoretically more power 

228
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,300
than they did.
And that was annoying.

229
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,134
And so what they did to,
to reconcile themselves to that was to 

230
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,370
pretend to be advocates for the working 
class,

231
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,653
but all they were doing was masking 
their own resentment about being 

232
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,980
improperly rewarded by the power 
hierarchy.

233
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,550
And when I read that and I wasn't very 
old,

234
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,190
I was probably 17 or so when I read 
that,

235
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,024
I thought that's exactly right.
He got it exactly right now he wrote 

236
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,301
that book.
The book was the road to Wigan pier,

237
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,260
which is a great book and or well spent 
a bunch of time,

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,640
I believe in the 30s with a coal miners 
in,

239
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,990
in the northern Uk.

240
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,430
And I mean those people,
man,

241
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,310
they had a hard life.
You know,

242
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,443
the coal miners would go out in the 
morning and then they would have to 

243
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:54,320
crawl down a tunnel way the hell 
underground to work.

244
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,680
They couldn't stand up in the tunnel 
because it wasn't tall enough.

245
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:00,980
So they started their work day,
which was very long and arduous,

246
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:01,814
like 12 hours long by crawling three 
quarters of a mile on their hands and 

247
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:06,834
knees just to get to where they were 
going to work and they need to get paid 

248
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,004
for that.
That was just like the morning exercise 

249
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,810
before you got to,
you know,

250
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,683
take a pick ax and hack coal out of the 
walls for 12 hours and then crawl back 

251
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:21,320
home and breathing in cold desk the 
whole time so that you were,

252
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,183
you know,
an old man by the time you were 45 and 

253
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,650
had black lung and the working 
conditions were absolutely appalling.

254
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,500
The company's owned all the houses.
They,

255
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,480
they charge the workers as much for rent
and food as they made,

256
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,440
except a little bit more so that not 
only were they paying all the money they

257
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,274
were making back to the companies,
but they were falling into debt at the 

258
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,810
same time they were doing it.
So,

259
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,950
you know,
it was no,

260
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:46,784
it was no joke.
And so it wasn't like Orwell was blind 

261
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:54,401
to the basic horrors of that.
He wrote a phenomenal book detailing out

262
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,930
there working conditions,
um,

263
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,120
you know,
as an onsite observer.

264
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:04,121
But then he followed it up with an essay
and the essay was well,

265
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,770
given the undeniable misery of 
industrial working class life,

266
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,023
why is it so difficult for the 
Socialists Philosophy to become 

267
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,280
prevalent?
And widespread,

268
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,413
prevalent enough and widespread enough 
in the UK so that it has some permanent 

269
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,040
power.
And his answer to that was,

270
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,874
well,
it's because most of the people who are 

271
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,783
leading the working class political 
movements don't care one bit about the 

272
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:30,764
poor.

273
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,780
They're just mad about the rich.
And I thought that's dead on.

274
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,614
And I also think that if you ever do an 
analysis of any sort of political 

275
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:43,400
movement without factoring in the effect
of resentment,

276
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,770
you're just not paying any attention at 
all.

277
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,350
The question isn't who do people like,
who are they supporting?

278
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,380
The question is who are they attempting 
to?

279
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,214
We'll press with their support of 
someone else and it's just as true on 

280
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:55,974
the right as it is on the left.
I'm not making any comments at the 

281
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,274
moment about the right because at least 
on university campuses we've already 

282
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:07,311
decided that the radical right is,
is morally intolerable.

283
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,023
They can't even show their face.
Whereas we're perfectly willing to 

284
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,480
accept the radical left.
And that's something that never fails to

285
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,943
amaze me.
It also never fails to amaze me that 

286
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,560
people don't even know that.
It's amazing.

287
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,360
You know,
because I know,

288
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,510
cause I've asked students this year,
after year after year,

289
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,760
the number of students who knows no what
happened in the Soviet Union or in China

290
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,500
during World War II pales in comparison 
to the number of students who know about

291
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,640
the Holocaust,
for example,

292
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:41,040
even though they might not know that 
much about the Holocaust.

293
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,980
That's what I'm trying to explain how it
gets,

294
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,260
well then I'll go a little farther with 
it.

295
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:03,094
I mean,
part of the reason that orwell wrote 

296
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:06,514
what he wrote,
he was really the first Western 

297
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:11,380
intellectual who woke up to what was 
happening in the Soviet Union.

298
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,243
And he basically woke up in the 1930s 
now it got complicated too because in 

299
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,290
the Spanish civil war,
just before World War II,

300
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,710
the good guys were the communists,
right?

301
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:28,600
Because there was a split essentially 
between the radical left and the radical

302
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,450
right in Spain and the radical right 
one.

303
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,990
And so Spain was basically fascist until
1982 under,

304
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:35,824
under Franco.
And Franco was an ally of Hitler and 

305
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,220
Mussolini and so forth.
And so during the 1930s,

306
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,530
it was considered quite heroic if you 
were,

307
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,293
I would say,
a young intellectual to go to Spain and 

308
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:49,750
fight on the side of the,
uh,

309
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,340
of the,
of the left.

310
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,560
And I think that was

311
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,913
that kind of set the moral tone in some 
sense because I think you could make a 

312
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,394
case that in Spain,
the left wingers were the good guys in 

313
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:06,324
that particular struggle,
even though it's not obvious by any 

314
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,254
means,
that they would've stayed the good guys 

315
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:14,220
if they would have won the war.
So I think part of it is,

316
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:18,420
is that among intellectuals,
the idea of the left as freedom fighters

317
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,343
took on,
took quite strong hold in the Spanish 

318
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:24,340
civil war.
And then I know that's where Orwell,

319
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,280
it impact in part,
for example,

320
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,100
it was exposed to it and the romance of 
that continued.

321
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:29,934
But so that's one possible answer.
The other one I think is the communist 

322
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:34,884
universalism.
I think that that fascism was an anti 

323
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:42,960
intellectual movement to its core,
whereas communism wasn't,

324
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,500
and it was,
it was often led by intellectuals and it

325
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,310
was really an doctrine.

326
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,863
Whereas fascism,
I would say was fundamentally an 

327
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,310
emotional doctrine or a dramatic 
doctrine or,

328
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,144
or something like that.
It was a lot more primordial because it 

329
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,110
was,
it was race based fundamentally,

330
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,670
you know,
so it,

331
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,370
you know,
young believed that the fascists,

332
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,200
the fascism in Germany was a reawakening
of pre Christian paganism,

333
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,210
roughly speaking like,
you know,

334
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,343
like real,
like real really like blood-based 

335
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,313
tribalism.
And so he thought of it as a regressive 

336
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,270
movement.
And,

337
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,103
and I think that that's certainly a 
position that's worth considering the 

338
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,460
communists,
you know,

339
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:25,294
they laid out a rational description of 
their upcoming utopia and it actually 

340
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,010
made quite a bit of sense from a 
rational perspective,

341
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:33,844
you know,
because when you start with a 

342
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:39,100
proposition like from each according to 
their ability to each according to their

343
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,630
need,
first of all,

344
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,980
it sounds attractive,
you know,

345
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,680
because the proposition is,
well,

346
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,514
you should,
you should obtain what you need from 

347
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,184
society.

348
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,430
So if you're,
if you're in trouble or if you're in,

349
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,400
if you're sick or if you're hurt,
then there should be a,

350
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,850
a backup for you so that you just don't 
fall out of society.

351
00:21:58,851 --> 00:21:59,980
And,
and parish.

352
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,173
And by the same token,
why not ask of people what they can 

353
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,374
contribute so that the stronger people 
in the more able people contribute as 

354
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:09,814
much as they can.
And the last April people contribute as 

355
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:12,214
much as they can.
And in some sense there's something 

356
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,820
that's universally fair about that.
Well,

357
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:17,260
you know,
as a,

358
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,380
as a set of logical propositions,
it's not self evident that it's wrong.

359
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,430
So,
and I,

360
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:30,400
I would say that certainly in Russia for
example,

361
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,760
which was basically surfs and Derisk 
Dick Kratz,

362
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:36,400
you know,
at the point of the first world war,

363
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:41,290
because the Russians were just crawling 
out from beneath a czarist monarchy that

364
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,440
was basically medieval in nature,
you know,

365
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,730
that was pretty attractive.

366
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,863
The question is,
the problem was who attractive to who 

367
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
and the way it played out in practice.
And you can just imagine this for 

368
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,170
example,
so imagine that there is a village.

369
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,004
And so one of the things that happened 
in Russia and the Soviet Union was a 

370
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:00,874
process called D Kula causation.
And the Kulaks were the co Kulak was a 

371
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:10,831
name given to the farmers in the Soviet 
Union who were in say in a given village

372
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:15,670
who were reasonably prosperous.
And so those might be people that have a

373
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,504
brick house and who have been running 
their farm for whatever reason well 

374
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,840
enough so that they could have a few 
employees.

375
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,723
Now one of the propositions of the 
radical left in the Soviet Union was 

376
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:29,944
that if you had any capital,
so that basically if you had any excess 

377
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,614
money at all,
and that would be enough money maybe to 

378
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:40,510
buy a brick house and to improve your 
machinery into hire a couple of people,

379
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,643
that fundamentally what you had done was
stolen that from the Labor of the 

380
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,470
proletariat of the working class.

381
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,220
And so then,
and you can understand that,

382
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,430
cause that's a Marxist,
that's a Marxist idea.

383
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,264
The Marxist idea was that Labor produces
excess value and that what capital does 

384
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:05,630
is vacuum up that value and basically 
steal it.

385
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,650
And so there's never really any 
appreciation in,

386
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,543
in the Marxist doctrine that there are 
creative things that can be done with 

387
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,074
capital itself.
And that Labor is actually rather 

388
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,310
difficult to,
to um,

389
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
define,
you know,

390
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,320
like good example of that is with say 
you're thinking about Bill Gates.

391
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,090
You know,
I mean,

392
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,280
it's not an easy,
it's not easy to make the case that Bill

393
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,113
Gates made $70 billion by exploiting his
workers or as customers doesn't seem to 

394
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:43,090
me that that's an accurate description.
No.

395
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,933
Now you can argue about the details with
regards to certain mon monopolistic 

396
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,930
practices and so forth.
But you know,

397
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:51,764
what I saw happening with Microsoft,
because I'm older than you guys and I 

398
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:55,790
watched what happened.

399
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,030
The computer's really kicked in,
in about 1993,

400
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,163
although we were using them fairly 
extensively by 1985 of the net kicked 

401
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,300
in,
in 1993.

402
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,253
What happened before gates was that 
programs were sold one by one and they 

403
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:15,050
were unbelievably expensive.
You know,

404
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,884
so a typical word processing program at 
the dawn of the computer age would have 

405
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,370
been approximately as much as the 
computer was,

406
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,380
which was way more expensive than they 
are now.

407
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,770
And what happened with gates was he 
bundled programs together.

408
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:30,470
That would be the Microsoft office,
Microsoft office suite,

409
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:33,740
and drop their prices by a factor of 
probably 20.

410
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,930
So all of a sudden,
poof,

411
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:40,580
everybody had Microsoft office.
It was a brilliant marketing ploy.

412
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,653
I mean,
what happened was that he noticed that 

413
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,420
the price of software rabidly plummets 
towards commodity level.

414
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,780
Right?
And he just accelerated the process.

415
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,153
So my point is,
is that regardless of what you think 

416
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:58,640
about Bill Gates,
the idea that he got his money merely by

417
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,310
stealing it from the Labor that produced
his,

418
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,443
his,
uh,

419
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,350
products is not,
it's an unsophisticated approach.

420
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,213
It's not self evident in the least.
It's also the case that large pools of 

421
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:13,130
capital,
you know,

422
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:16,450
you got to ask yourself if,
if,

423
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,430
if capital was distributed equally among
the population,

424
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:20,264
while the first thing you can be sure of
is that it wouldn't stay equally 

425
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:25,310
distributed for very long,
not very long at all.

426
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,630
And the second thing is,
is that it also begs the question is,

427
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,464
do you want a system where the only 
people who have substantial economic 

428
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:35,600
power are actually members of the 
government?

429
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,170
Or is it safer to have large pools of 
capital somewhat arbitrarily distributed

430
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,670
in the general population?
So there multiple sources of power,

431
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,103
you know,
so if you think about what's happening 

432
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,180
in China,
for example,

433
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,253
it doesn't seem self evident to me that 
the rise of multiple millionaires and 

434
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,880
multiple billionaires in China has been 
a bad thing for the population.

435
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
Not least because those people hold 
power that can buttress the entire 

436
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:06,270
society against the overwhelming 
centrality of the government.

437
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,470
You know?
And now you might argue that you know,

438
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,323
person,
they shouldn't have that money because 

439
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:14,700
it's unfair.
And I suppose in you can make a case for

440
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:15,750
that,
but,

441
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,190
but it's very unit dimensional,
that sort of thinking.

442
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,110
And another thing that you might think 
about is that there are certain kinds of

443
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:22,944
projects that can't be undertaken 
without massive pools of private 

444
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,750
capital.
So for example,

445
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,290
if you want to build a chip fabrication 
plant,

446
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,333
it's $4 billion.
So those aren't going to get built 

447
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:38,130
unless there are large pools of unused 
capital,

448
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,050
more or less at hand.
And you know,

449
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:40,884
Ilan Musk,
for example right now is going to build 

450
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:47,610
a massive factory to produce a new kind 
of lithium ion battery.

451
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,444
You know,
and it's going to be staggeringly 

452
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:52,110
expensive and he has no idea if that'll 
work.

453
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,110
And probably it's hard to say probably 
it won't because most things don't work,

454
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,883
but there's not even a chance that a 
project like that could get off the 

455
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,784
ground given it's unbelievable,
unbelievably high risk nature and the 

456
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:07,374
demand for excessive levels of capital 
unless he happened to have more money 

457
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:15,740
than God.
So it's necessary to,

458
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,020
to,
to analyze problems at a high resolution

459
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:24,021
level and not fall into the foolishness 
of unit dimensional utopian schemes.

460
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,500
And partly because the,
that'd be speaks ignorance as far as I'm

461
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,334
concerned.
If you use an ideological approach to a 

462
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:31,524
problem,
all that means to me is that you don't 

463
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,624
know what the hell you're talking about 
and that you're too lazy to figure it 

464
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,780
out.
And,

465
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,303
but,
but worse than that is that underneath 

466
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,054
the ideological presuppositions,
there's always some kind of hatred of 

467
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:49,911
one form or another that's never,
never agreed to by the people who happen

468
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:53,190
to be in that position on the 
ideological spectrum.

469
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,030
And that turns out to be something 
that's tremendously dangerous.

470
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,153
You know?
So I know someone who's a businessman 

471
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:03,690
who's had a tremendous amount of 
success,

472
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,770
although,
um,

473
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,800
it wasn't permanent success in some 
ways,

474
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,920
although success is rel rarely 
permanent.

475
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,653
You know,
I talked to him about both left and 

476
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:19,440
right wing approaches to economic 
revitalization in Canada.

477
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,873
And one of his primary claims is that 
Canada's too unsophisticated and it's 

478
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:26,334
legal and political systems to support 
high tech industries against 

479
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,600
international competition.
We're just,

480
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,900
we just don't have the power 
fundamentally,

481
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,090
conceptually or legally.
And so he says,

482
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:40,230
well,
the left wingers,

483
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,150
you know,
their basic is that while you don't need

484
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,223
large corporations and they're,
they're more of a pain in the neck than 

485
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,033
they're worth.
And certainly there's no sense in the 

486
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:54,910
government supporting businessmen.
And that's just not helpful because most

487
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:55,744
countries that have tremendously 
powerful say intellectual property 

488
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,783
companies and which is where all the 
money is now have a legal system behind 

489
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,404
them and a governmental system behind 
them that's doing absolutely everything 

490
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:08,584
they can to support the distribution of 
those companies out into the 

491
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:16,210
international market and to ensure that 
they succeed.

492
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,690
And then on the right you have people 
who say,

493
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:20,524
well,
all you have to do is pair government 

494
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:22,714
down to nothing.
And then the entrepreneurs can go out 

495
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:27,340
there and make money and you know from 
his perspective,

496
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,970
and it's an extraordinary well informed 
perspective,

497
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:31,804
neither of those solutions are going to 
work because the world is too damn 

498
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,910
complicated for the answer from the 
right to be,

499
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:39,490
well we need less government,
which is,

500
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,840
that's not an answer,
right?

501
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,700
Any Moron can say that in one second.
It's not,

502
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,030
it's not a co coherent system of 
thought.

503
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,450
It's devoted to the solving of a 
specific problem.

504
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,510
It's way to row low resolution,
you know?

505
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:55,240
And then you can easily untangled the 
rights claims because,

506
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,074
because the right is basically orderly 
and because there's somewhat disgust 

507
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,090
sensitive,
they look at people who are reading the,

508
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,343
you know,
what the low end of the dominance 

509
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,170
hierarchy distributions.

510
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,003
And they think,
well it's just useless bastard to never 

511
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,490
do any work that are down there.
And if they would just,

512
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,773
you know,
get off their ass and look around there 

513
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:12,854
be a job for them.
And the thing about that is that it's 

514
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:19,780
true for a certain percentage of the 
people that they're referring to because

515
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,780
there are unconscientious people who 
don't do a damn thing.

516
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,033
But then it's untrue because there's all
sorts of reasons why people end up at 

517
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:27,964
the bottom of the dominance hierarchy.
And some of them have to do with the 

518
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,740
fact that they're not very 
conscientious,

519
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:37,480
which is why conscientiousness predicts 
success over the span of your life in a,

520
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,060
in a,
in a western democracy.

521
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:40,894
But then there's all sorts of other 
reasons why people aren't thriving that 

522
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,010
have nothing to do with,
you know,

523
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,113
their willingness to work.
So it's not sort of approach that's 

524
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,910
useful for solving any sort of complex 
problem.

525
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,440
So,
and then there's the additional problem,

526
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:57,274
which is that the people who are 
offering utopian solutions aren't who 

527
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:03,370
they say they are.
And that's a big problem.

528
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,043
And I think we learned that we should 
have learned that more than anything 

529
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,820
else by looking at what happened in the 
20th century.

530
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,880
You know?
And I think the fact that like,

531
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,070
just out of curiosity,
I'm sure I've asked you this before,

532
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:15,904
but how many of you were aware that 
stellan starves 6 million people in the 

533
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:23,020
Ukraine in the 1930s okay.
How did you learn that?

534
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,990
Okay,
so,

535
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,410
so you knew that,
how do you know?

536
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,910
I was really interested in that.

537
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,730
So did you learn that on your own?
Yeah.

538
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,803
You learned that on your own.
How many people were taught that in you 

539
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:46,210
were were okay after university?
Yeah,

540
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,420
university.
Okay.

541
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,730
That's good.
Anybody else learned at university

542
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,063
projects?

543
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,230
It's a very strange form of luck.
All right.

544
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,800
In a class like that guy.
But like

545
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,533
right.
And the 6 million deaths in the Ukraine 

546
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:20,790
in the 1930s that's not like this by the
way

547
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,403
course.

548
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,410
Right?
Right.

549
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes.
Well,

550
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:27,114
and now it's just the,
that's just the tiny tip of what 

551
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:32,640
happened in the Soviet Union between 
1919 to 1959

552
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,823
it was embarrassing.

553
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,040
It should be embarrassing.
Like it's,

554
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:37,581
it's,
you know,

555
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,010
the,
the,

556
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,843
the thing that's so terrible about that 
is that what happened in the 20th 

557
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,170
century is something that we need to 
understand.

558
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,560
We have to understand it because it's 
the most,

559
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,350
you know,
the,

560
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,870
the commission of those atrocities both 
on the left wing and the right wing,

561
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,943
especially when you view them from a 
Nietzschean or Dostoyevsky and 

562
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:58,694
perspective,
which is that while they were the 

563
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,710
inevitable consequence of the collapse 
of,

564
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,520
of traditional religious systems,
that's a,

565
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,720
that that is something that's so 
important that it's the most vital thing

566
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,900
you need to know in my estimation.
I mean,

567
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,660
the other thing that we need to 
remember,

568
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,210
and this is sort of creeping up on us 
again,

569
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,540
by the way,
is that the,

570
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,703
the potential for nuclear holocaust,
which was really a partners in 1962 and 

571
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:33,671
in 1984 was a direct consequence of this
utopian of the,

572
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:36,410
of the battle for various utopias.

573
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,140
And you know,
it just about wiped us out.

574
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:42,380
And the thing is,
is we haven't solved that problem yet.

575
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,890
We haven't solved it at all because it's
the old horror.

576
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:46,724
So Cyrus problem,
which is how do you stop your damn 

577
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:54,590
institutions from becoming genocidally 
corrupt?

578
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,390
And to me,
that's,

579
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,253
that's a cross cutting problem.
It's not like how do you stop the 

580
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,194
government from becoming corrupt?
Or how do you stop corporations from 

581
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:03,884
becoming corrupt even though those are 
two perfectly reasonable sets of 

582
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,830
problems.
I can't see how they're different.

583
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,770
Um,
but then how do you,

584
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,633
how is it that you act within 
institutions so that you don't become 

585
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,504
corrupt and also so that you don't 
further the corruption of the 

586
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:21,944
institution?
And you can be absolutely sure that for 

587
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,064
all of you,
this is going to be one of the most 

588
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:30,470
fundamental ethical problems that you 
face throughout your entire life because

589
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,560
you're all going to be members in one 
way or another,

590
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:35,630
have large and powerful institutions.

591
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,243
So the way you comport yourself in those
institutions is going to determine in 

592
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,084
large degree the,
whether you're a slave or a free person 

593
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,064
or a tyrant.
And also whether or not the institution 

594
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:54,210
within which you work becomes tyrannical
and destructive.

595
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,330
And like I see this particularly in my 
clinical practice,

596
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,523
lots of the people who I've dealt with,
their problem has been pathologies in 

597
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,750
their workplace.
They're bullied by a manager,

598
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,700
for example,
or maybe by a coworker,

599
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,743
or they're driven to absolute insanity 
by the proliferation of completely 

600
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:17,030
counterproductive and crazy,
uh,

601
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,070
regulations and rules.
So,

602
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,373
and they don't know what to do about it.
Generally they're too afraid to do 

603
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,020
anything about it.
And,

604
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,943
but that's not helpful because if,
if they're afraid to stand up and stop 

605
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,950
it,
then they pay a price,

606
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,200
possibly,
often not the price.

607
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:36,320
They think they'll pay it by the way.
But,

608
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:37,154
oh,
but if they don't stand up and do 

609
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:38,934
anything about it,
they also pay a price in my observation 

610
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:41,694
has been that,
that although that's a price you pay 

611
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,040
ounce with,
with Flash,

612
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,340
ounce by ounce,
instead of one pound at a time,

613
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,533
you end up losing more over the long run
than you do by standing up and having 

614
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,650
something to say.

615
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,230
Uh,
your advice.

616
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,120
My partner,
he's a contractor,

617
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,663
the contract or another contractor and 
the contractor was giving you a part of 

618
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:07,420
my power is in your story matters and 
stuff.

619
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:09,430
And then sort of sad like,
you know,

620
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:11,820
if not interested in doing the work or 
whatever,

621
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,690
then forget it.
And like I said,

622
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,780
my boyfriend by tax,
not the best medication or whatever,

623
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,630
they said,
well you know,

624
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,280
you know him would say if you're not 
prepared to walk away then you know,

625
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,740
you're never really going to get their 
rights back.

626
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,940
So you know,
prepared to walk away.

627
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:38,470
You think strong minded like he would 
absolutely put it in.

628
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:39,794
But yeah,
I can edit it down a bit from what he 

629
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:43,624
would normally do.
And it actually worked out for the 

630
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:46,931
better.
It suddenly,

631
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,540
oh hours increased responsibility 
increased.

632
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,640
Once you realize like,
oh,

633
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:52,474
like you're mismanaging me.
It's not that I don't want to work more 

634
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:58,990
is that you know that the problem here 
and you want to hire someone else,

635
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:00,550
then I implore you to go do that.

636
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,313
One of the things that's quite 
interesting about people who are 

637
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:09,601
tyrannical is that they're often weak 
and so they'll,

638
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,940
they'll push on you and they don't have 
any real internal boundaries.

639
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,370
They'll push on you and push on you.
And as far as you can be pushed,

640
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,413
there's no ending to that.
And they may even delight in that 

641
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,643
because if they're weak and resentful,
the fact that they can exercise some 

642
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,500
power and caused some misery is actually
quite satisfying.

643
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,963
Especially maybe if they're,
they're also jealous of you for one 

644
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,414
reason or another,
then they can really make your life 

645
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,130
hell.
But

646
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,260
a lot of ways to my partner,
right.

647
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:46,050
So I think that it was coming from a 
place of insecurity.

648
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,060
Right,
right.

649
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,200
Well that's a very common,
oh,

650
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,034
it's,
it's very,

651
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,270
it's very common.
I mean you guys will all experience that

652
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,300
or,
or meet it out as you move through your,

653
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,680
your,
your life.

654
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:58,514
Because there'll be lots of times when 
you're in a situation where you're 

655
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:04,040
smarter and more competent than the 
person who's supervising you.

656
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,470
And you might have your head screwed on 
straight or two.

657
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,633
Whereas the loss would be times where 
you're supervising someone who's like 

658
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:13,760
that and they have advantages over you,
you know,

659
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:15,350
so,
but if you,

660
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,323
as a general rule,
if you're willing to walk and you tell 

661
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:24,740
the person exactly what's going on,
they will leave you alone from then on.

662
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:28,490
They will walk a wide berth around you 
and leave you the hell alone.

663
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,421
Now,
you know,

664
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:30,254
they might cause some conspiratorial 
trouble in one place or another trying 

665
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:34,850
to get back at you.

666
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,880
But my experience has been that that's 
rare than you think.

667
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:39,530
In general.
It's not very effective.

668
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,660
But unless you're,
you know,

669
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,820
one of the things soldier Nixon talks 
about,

670
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:44,654
and Frankel as well,
and this is all relevant to the last 

671
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,840
half of the course,
is,

672
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,160
um,
where should your fundamental value find

673
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,720
itself?
Now,

674
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,063
you know,
we've been talking about the hierarchy 

675
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:58,130
of values.
You know,

676
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,353
I've showed you that idea many times 
that your action is nested inside a 

677
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,240
conceptual map and that's nested inside 
another conceptual map and so forth,

678
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,643
all the way out as far as you can go.
And one of the things that I'd been 

679
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,670
curious about is,
well,

680
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:16,580
how far out can you go?
And I think,

681
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,220
I think I know actually how far out you 
can go.

682
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,054
I think the ultimate question I believe 
for human beings is whether or not 

683
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:29,450
they're working to make the world a 
better place or a worse place.

684
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,193
Okay.
And you could say better by whose 

685
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:33,494
standards are worse by whose standards,
but I don't care about that question 

686
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,210
because I would say that for each 
individual,

687
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,523
they're either trying to make the world 
a better place by their standards or a 

688
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:45,944
worse place by their standards.
So the question of absolute standards 

689
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,330
actually doesn't enter into it.
So because if you're resentful and,

690
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,553
and while we'll just go with resentful 
cause resentment moves towards 

691
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,430
resentment,
moves towards genocide fundamentally,

692
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,010
now it takes a while to get there.
But that's really where it's headed.

693
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,623
If you're resentful,
what you're going to do is try to make 

694
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:10,190
the world a worse place in whatever 
creative manner you can think up.

695
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,500
And you'll know it's worse.
I mean,

696
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:14,480
you might be a little wrong and maybe by
accident,

697
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:16,250
some time when you try to make something
worse,

698
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:17,060
it'll get better.

699
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,910
But that's just a mistake.
It's not like you don't know what you're

700
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:20,744
doing,
you know bloody well know what you're 

701
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:22,664
doing.
And I think people know exactly what 

702
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:26,960
they're doing at each time they make a 
decision,

703
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,220
not that they necessarily know what 
they're doing across large spans of time

704
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,443
and not that they necessarily all of 
those decisions because you don't 

705
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,280
remember any of your decisions,
right?

706
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,533
They just start manifesting themselves 
out in the world as consequences and 

707
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:43,034
they,
and you also start to build systems in 

708
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:45,374
your head that do things automatically.
And so like if you're resentful and you 

709
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,240
act on that repeatedly for years,
you're going to build a little automatic

710
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,670
resentment monster at the back of your 
brain.

711
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,850
And it's just going to do things like 
that without you even noticing.

712
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,520
And that's when you become unconscious 
in the,

713
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,350
in the psychoanalytic way.

714
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,410
You're bloody conscious when you make 
the decisions.

715
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,190
Now you might not be fully conscious of 
all the repercussions,

716
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,250
but you can't be,
but I don't think it matters at all.

717
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,533
The other thing that I've observed or I 
think I've observed is that I've never 

718
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:21,851
seen anyone ever get away with anything 
they ever did and I think the reason for

719
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,020
that,
I think it's quite clear,

720
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,530
it's that if what you're dealing with is
real,

721
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,540
so it's,
it's there,

722
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,310
it's actual,
it has some structure.

723
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:36,320
If you bend or twist it,
that twist and Ben stays there,

724
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,154
it's going to snap back.
It's going to cause some trail of like 

725
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,174
some causal trail of trouble.
Now the trail might be so peculiar and 

726
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:49,280
bizarre that by the time it produces a 
negative outcome for you,

727
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,220
you have no idea what the initial cause 
was.

728
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:55,700
But I can tell you what tremendous 
amount of what you do in psychotherapy,

729
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:56,534
especially of the more psychoanalytic 
variety rather than the behavioral 

730
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:03,680
problem solving variety,
which is also extraordinarily useful.

731
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,020
In fact,
it's primarily useful is,

732
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,300
okay,
why did this happen?

733
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,500
And you trace it back and you trace it 
back and you trace it back and you trace

734
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,480
it back and then all of a sudden the 
person goes,

735
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,320
Aha,
there's how the dominoes fell.

736
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:18,660
You know,
when,

737
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,660
sometimes it's horrifying because 
sometimes the initial problem isn't even

738
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:24,824
the persons,
it's like something that happened 

739
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,660
between their mother and their and their
mother's father.

740
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,733
You know?
So you can certainly be the person who 

741
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,560
inherits multigenerational Karma.
I mean,

742
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,780
that's basically old cyrus.
You can think of,

743
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,120
oh,
Cyrus as multigenerational Karma,

744
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,313
you know,
you inherit all of the errors that are 

745
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,000
embedded in the adaptive system,
you know?

746
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:50,120
And that's also what makes young people 
often resentful about,

747
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,890
you know,
the power structure,

748
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:56,870
the patriarchy or,
or,

749
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,190
or the military industrial complex or 
whatever you want to call it.

750
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,383
You know,
of course the bloody thinks corrupt and 

751
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:05,810
half ready to fall over,
you know,

752
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,480
it is because first of all,
things get outdated.

753
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,510
Just as time progresses.
And second,

754
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:15,800
they get outdated and corrupt because 
people are willfully blind and refuse to

755
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,200
update them.
And so you're stuck with that.

756
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,034
You're stuck with that from a social 
perspective and you're stuck with that 

757
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,920
with regards to your own individual and 
familial history.

758
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
So you know,
that's partly why I wanted to portray it

759
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:32,940
in this class as an existential problem.
It's not,

760
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,703
it's not,

761
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,730
you shouldn't take it personally.
It's just a condition of life.

762
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,743
It's like fragility,
individual fragility as a condition of 

763
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:45,804
life.
You're stuck with having to deal with 

764
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:51,060
that corruption of society is a fact of 
life.

765
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,063
You have to deal with that.
The perversity of the natural world and 

766
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:58,170
the fact that you don't know everything 
is a fact of life.

767
00:44:58,171 --> 00:44:59,004
And then the chaos that underlies 
everything that you come from and that 

768
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,920
you will return to.
That's also a fact of life.

769
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,383
And so then the question is,
and those are ugly fact because I've 

770
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,280
only concentrated on the negative 
element there,

771
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:13,530
but those are ugly fact.
So then the question is,

772
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:15,660
well,
what should you do about that?

773
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,423
And despair and nihilism and resentment 
or a perfectly logically reasonable 

774
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,350
response.
The problem is though,

775
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,243
as far as I can tell,
is that all that does is turn tragedy 

776
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:33,960
into hell and it turns out that hell is 
actually worse than tragedy.

777
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,333
And I've seen this in many situations.
So a while back I was with a family 

778
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,003
where one of their family members was 
dying and not a particularly pleasant 

779
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:45,114
death.
It was associated with a degenerative 

780
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,810
brain disease.
You know when those are,

781
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,300
those are,
they're not as nasty as they get,

782
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:52,134
but they're certainly up in the plenty 
nasty category and the family comported 

783
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,610
themselves incredibly well.
You know,

784
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,444
they had a lot of experience with death.
One of them was a palliative care nurse 

785
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:06,000
and most of them had some medical 
experience,

786
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,223
so they weren't naive about such things.
But the family came together and took 

787
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:13,464
care of the person who was deteriorating
and did what they had to to help them 

788
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:21,840
when it was necessary.
So the person's prime caretaker,

789
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:24,300
her,
her husband was very,

790
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:25,134
very good at admitting when things had 
fallen down yet another level and doing 

791
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,194
something about it right then and there 
instead of pretending that it wasn't 

792
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,880
happening.
Which is a great way to catastrophe.

793
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,080
I'm like,
you know,

794
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,370
it was quite,
it was not pleasant but it wasn't hell.

795
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,620
They managed it,
you know,

796
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:44,454
when it pulled the family together a 
little bit better and everybody who was 

797
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:48,864
going through the experience had the 
support of everybody else and there 

798
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,474
wasn't a lot of garbage underneath the 
family carpet that that often is this 

799
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:56,084
sort of thing that comes up when 
families are extremely stressed and 

800
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:58,860
yeah.

801
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,693
MMM.

802
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,133
One of the things I think they all 
gained was that their family tightened 

803
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,074
up approximately as much I would say as 
the support they lost from the family 

804
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:17,630
member who departed now.

805
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,140
So that makes you wonder a situation 
like that.

806
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:22,974
It's like,
well obviously the world has this 

807
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,340
tremendously negative multilayer 
structure,

808
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,400
but that leaves open the question,
which is,

809
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,970
well,
if you reacted to it properly,

810
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,583
to what degree could you ameliorate it?
It's pretty damn obvious that you could 

811
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,050
make it worse.
Like that's easy.

812
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:44,681
You know,
if some,

813
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,514
if a catastrophe befalls you and all you
can do is run around in circles and 

814
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:53,020
panic and you're just as maybe a 
catastrophe occurs.

815
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:53,854
And it's affecting five people and you 
fall apart in a cowardly and 

816
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,844
pathological manner,
then they have two people to deal with 

817
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,990
at a time of crisis instead of one.
And I can't see that being the least bit

818
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:07,180
useful.
And so one of the things that means,

819
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,014
and you know,
it's also something I really don't 

820
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,010
understand why people aren't taught 
this,

821
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:12,844
is that one of the things you have to do
is to learn to be competent in the face 

822
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:16,870
of tragedy.

823
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,590
And you also have to understand that 
that's not brutality.

824
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,290
You know?
Cause one of the things you might wonder

825
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,124
is if someone close to you dies,
how morally obligated are you to fall 

826
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,070
apart?
And you could easily say,

827
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:31,540
well,
if you really love the person,

828
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,260
the devastation should be total.
And then if you say,

829
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:36,320
well,
it shouldn't be total,

830
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:38,200
because that just adds to the 
catastrophe.

831
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:42,430
Then what that implies is that there's a
sort of toughness that you have to have,

832
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:43,264
even in intimate relationships that 
allows you to remain standing in the 

833
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:47,794
midst of a hurricane.
And there's something about that that's 

834
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,430
kind of harsh,
you know?

835
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,190
So if you're the person who has to make 
funeral arrangements,

836
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:56,440
when you're,
when are your parents passes away?

837
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,630
One of the things people might wonder 
is,

838
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,880
well,
how can you be calm enough to do that at

839
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,020
a time like that?

840
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,360
But the answer to that is,
well,

841
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,194
it's exactly at a time like that when 
you better have your act together and 

842
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,374
that means you can't be too afraid of 
death and that you can't be too afraid 

843
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,980
of being left on your own and that you 
have to be able to stand on your own two

844
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,200
feet.
And that in that sort of time,

845
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,470
there's enough of you so that you can be
of service and,

846
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,860
and support to the people around you who
may be,

847
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:26,720
have fewer resources than you maybe are 
younger,

848
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,830
more helpless,
and that you can actually help.

849
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,970
And that's a much better.
Not only is that a much better outcome,

850
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:37,924
but it's the right aim.
That's the way that you should be 

851
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:41,320
conceiving your development in the 
future.

852
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,210
You know,
you should be the sort of person who can

853
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:45,790
be relied on when,
when things fall apart.

854
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,073
And I also think that that's analogous 
to what we were talking about before 

855
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:50,734
with regards to your ability to 
negotiate from within the confines of 

856
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:54,484
pathological structures.
You should not lay yourself so open to 

857
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,414
loss that if you lose your dad,
it means you've configured your life 

858
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,973
improperly.
So if you're so dependent on one person 

859
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:05,674
that you cannot tolerate their loss,
then what that means is you have not 

860
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:09,904
distributed your support properly along 
all of the multiple sources of support 

861
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:19,930
that you could conceivably have.
You can't stand on one leg like no legs.

862
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:20,764
You're,
you're done.

863
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,220
You're in chaos.
One leg that makes you too vulnerable.

864
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,520
It's not wise.
And so you have fortify yourself so that

865
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:33,260
not only can you withstand the pressure 
of tyranny from the pathological systems

866
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:34,094
that you'll end up involved in,
but that you can also tolerate the 

867
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,280
catastrophes of Mother Nature without 
falling apart and,

868
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:42,380
and disintegrating.

869
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,393
Because say you may fall ill or you may 
start to grow old and it's the only 

870
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,420
thing that'll be,

871
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,180
I think that's exactly the same problem 
is that,

872
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,031
you know,
I mean I,

873
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:04,290
I know the basic dimensions that you 
have to fortify,

874
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,420
you know,
we actually,

875
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:06,254
we,
you've covered them in the future 

876
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:08,460
authoring program,
roughly speaking.

877
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,380
It's not that difficult to lay them out.
And I would sort of think about these as

878
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,890
the central elements of human nature in 
some sense.

879
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,213
No.
And one of the things that is worth 

880
00:51:19,441 --> 00:51:20,274
pointing out by the way,
is that most utopian schemes admit to 

881
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:25,410
know human nature,
right?

882
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:29,460
Because they paused at a certain kind of
utopia to find that as perfect.

883
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,294
And then imagine that they can build the
human being that would fit in that 

884
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,860
utopia.
That's certainly what happened among the

885
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:37,530
Nazis.
And also what happened among the radical

886
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:38,550
left wingers,
you know,

887
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:41,430
so they're going to build the new 
socialist man.

888
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,610
And that would be someone who was 
completely unselfish and devoted towards

889
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:45,150
the state.

890
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:45,983
It's like,
well,

891
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,480
you don't want to build someone who's 
completely unselfish.

892
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,651
It's,
it's,

893
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,300
it's a foolish endeavor.
It's a,

894
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,090
it's a hubris stick and arrogant 
endeavor.

895
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,700
You know,
you have no idea how much selfishness is

896
00:51:56,701 --> 00:51:59,640
necessary,
but non is certainly the wrong amount.

897
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,503
Like I would say roughly speaking,
you should take care of yourself about 

898
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:08,250
as well as you take care of someone 
who's close to you,

899
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,293
who's best interests you have at heart.
I think you have a moral obligation to 

900
00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:13,644
do that.
So basic moral obligation you have to 

901
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:15,894
yourself,
which is that on average year as 

902
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:20,790
valuable as everyone,
every other individual is on average.

903
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:24,780
You know,
when you may have some elements that are

904
00:52:24,781 --> 00:52:27,810
particularity virtuous and some elements
that are particularly,

905
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,480
you know,
we can contemptible but,

906
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,620
and those should be uplifted and,
and dealt with.

907
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,693
But you don't have any right to hurt 
yourself and you don't have any right 

908
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:40,860
not to take care of yourself.

909
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,693
And part of the reason is exactly that.
It's like you have to distribute 

910
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:48,450
yourself out so that you're also not a 
burden and being overly selfish.

911
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:51,090
It's certainly one way to to do yourself
in.

912
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,433
And you know,
it's also this sort of thing that's 

913
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:56,340
never discussed seriously in the modern 
world,

914
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,670
in relationship to such things as 
marriage because we're very,

915
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:03,990
very immature in our conscious morality.
So you might think,

916
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:05,910
well,
why get married?

917
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,700
This is a question that you attempted to
address.

918
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:11,310
For example,
what's the purpose in marriage?

919
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,310
Well,
the standard routine is that,

920
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:14,760
uh,
uh,

921
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,593
you know,
uh,

922
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,543
uh,
14 year old girl who still believes in 

923
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,580
Unicorns.
You know,

924
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:21,414
it's while you find the love of your 
life and then fundamentally the 

925
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:27,330
arrangement is and magic for,
for,

926
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,100
for the rest of your life.
It's,

927
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,930
you live happily ever after.
You know,

928
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:31,764
and there's,
there's something to that on the 

929
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,044
mythological plane,
but you got to think that's not a 

930
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:39,870
philosophy of,
of intimate relationship.

931
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,540
You know,
it's so naive and,

932
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,600
and undeveloped that it's embarrassing.
So with regards to marriage,

933
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,043
I mean,
I can tell you some things I know about 

934
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,790
with regards to keeping a longterm 
intimate relationship together.

935
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,803
One is you,
you can't lie to your partner and they 

936
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:00,680
can't lie to you.
And the reason for that is,

937
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:02,610
is that if you don't know what's going 
on,

938
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:03,444
you can't adapt to it.
So if the person's lying to you or 

939
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:07,374
you're lying to them,
neither of you are there so you're not 

940
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:12,240
going to be able to get anywhere with 
that.

941
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:13,074
Cause you know,
if someone tells you that the truck is 

942
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:19,080
broken down when the car isn't working 
and you go up to fix the truck,

943
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:20,850
that's hardly going to get the car 
going.

944
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,253
So we know one of the things we tried to
impress on our children when they were 

945
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,700
growing up,
you know,

946
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:30,210
to some chil children always experiment 
with lying,

947
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:31,044
was that if you lie to me,
I can't help you because you don't know 

948
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,260
what the hell's going on.

949
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,900
So how the hell can I help you if I 
don't know what's going on.

950
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,333
And you know,
people like Carl Rogers and his 

951
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,693
certainly echoed in the psychoanalytic 
community in la at large is that rogers 

952
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,793
in particular said the precondition for 
a therapeutic relationship is that the 

953
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:51,930
people agree to tell each other the 
truth.

954
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,610
Now young took that a step farther,
which I think is absolutely brilliant.

955
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:57,444
And it's,
it's a measure of his humility and 

956
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:02,550
genius that he was able to formulate 
this idea.

957
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:05,040
He said that in order to tell someone 
the truth,

958
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:10,041
you have to tie them to use so they 
can't run away and vice versa.

959
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,570
And that's the purpose of the marriage 
bond from,

960
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:13,404
uh,
from the perspective of psychological 

961
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:17,580
development.
It's like we all have a monster.

962
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,013
We all are monsters.
And if the person with whom you're 

963
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:25,680
communicating can run away,
there's no way you're ever going to show

964
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,060
them what sort of monster you are.

965
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,893
And then there's no way you were ever 
going to learn what sort of monster you 

966
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:31,980
are.
And there's no way you're gonna know how

967
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:33,600
to control it,
you know?

968
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:34,434
And so part of what's kept me on the 
straight and narrow in so far is that 

969
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,900
speed possible during my marriage is 
that,

970
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,663
um,
I know that I'm not getting rid of this 

971
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,084
woman.
And so if I don't solve the damn 

972
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:51,450
problem,
I'm going to be living it out painfully,

973
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,920
daily,
weekly,

974
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:54,540
monthly,
or yearly.

975
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,820
For the next,
for the rest of my life.

976
00:55:56,821 --> 00:56:00,480
It's like in India,
have to imagine that it's like,

977
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:01,141
no way,
man,

978
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:01,974
I'm going to have this out here right 
here and now because the alternative is 

979
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,100
I'm going to have this problem forever.
And so is she.

980
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:11,490
And,
and the corollary of that is that if I'm

981
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:14,160
having a problem with her,
I'm also,

982
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,323
despite my own desire,
open to the possibility that it's my 

983
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:20,310
stupidity that's causing it.

984
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,413
It's not like I'm just going to roll 
over and admit it because I tend to 

985
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:25,264
think I'm right,
but I do allow for the possibility that 

986
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:28,924
I might be wrong.
And so if she can convince me that I'm 

987
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:33,520
wrong and sometimes I help her make the 
arguments,

988
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,360
then I want to find out because I also 
don't want to have the problem every day

989
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,194
for the next bloody 50 years if it 
happens to be my stupidity that's 

990
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:43,210
causing it.
And so it's,

991
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:44,044
it's terror and humility that that lead 
me to attempt to find out where I'm 

992
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:51,700
wrong.
It's not because I'm a good person.

993
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,623
I wouldn't say that it's because I know 
enough that I know enough to know that 

994
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:56,944
if I am blind in some area,
I'm going to get hit by the thing I'm 

995
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,690
blind about over and over and I don't 
want that.

996
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:05,710
That's partly why I had you guys imagine
your catastrophic future.

997
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,370
It's like you need to know where you 
don't want to go.

998
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,443
I also think that's why cultures,
part of the reason why cultures have 

999
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:17,590
always positive heaven and hell or at 
least heaven and the underworld,

1000
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,580
because those are real places now what 
they have to do met,

1001
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:22,743
met what their reality is.
Metaphysically it's like God only knows 

1002
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,733
literally,
but as actual places that you could 

1003
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,480
inhabit,
it's like they're,

1004
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:37,450
they're all,
you just have to wake up and look to see

1005
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:39,730
that.
Lots of people live in hell,

1006
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,220
you know?
And some of them are so deeply embedded.

1007
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:43,054
I like to think of hell as the worst 
suburb of the underworld and that's the 

1008
00:57:46,691 --> 00:57:47,524
part where you go,
you go into chaos and that's the 

1009
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,370
underworld and then the chaos in 
bidders,

1010
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,020
you and you sink deeper and deeper.

1011
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,130
And when you've got to the spot that's 
so deep that you can't get out,

1012
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,353
then you're in hell.
And people are there all the time 

1013
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:03,700
because their lives are so surrounded by
chaos that they can't fix them.

1014
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,360
And that's really,
you do not want to be there.

1015
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,510
So young's proposition with marriage 
was,

1016
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,580
well there was a variety of them.
They're very,

1017
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,380
very intelligent.
You know,

1018
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:15,214
he said for example,
that the reason that you ally yourself 

1019
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:18,784
with someone is because the probability 
that your faults and your virtues won't 

1020
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:23,824
line up is quite high.
Just like you know you're not going to 

1021
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:28,084
get,
your children aren't going to get a 

1022
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:30,424
disease that's,
that requires two disease genes 

1023
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,953
generally because the probability that 
you'll be a carrier of a particular 

1024
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:42,220
mutation and that your partner will be 
at the same time is quite low.

1025
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,950
It's part of the reason why there is 
sexual reproduction.

1026
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,350
So your errors and your partner's errors
aren't going to match up.

1027
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,333
And so their strengths,
we'll cover your weaknesses that occurs 

1028
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,124
at a genetic level,
but it also occurs at the level of 

1029
00:58:56,291 --> 00:59:01,240
information exchange.
So if you're lucky where you're weak,

1030
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:02,074
your partner won't be.
Now often you see in marriages where 

1031
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:04,924
they start to really crumble is where 
one person's weakness hits another 

1032
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:11,410
person in their weakness and it starts 
to develop a positive feedback loop.

1033
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,680
So,
so in my marriage for example,

1034
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:18,640
my wife tends to be accusatory and I 
tend to be guilty and that's,

1035
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,860
that's a difficult thing for us to deal 
with.

1036
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,733
So,
and you know,

1037
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,580
now and then it kind of opens up a bit 
of a hole,

1038
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,750
but,
and,

1039
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,190
and that,
those little positive feedback loops can

1040
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:30,560
develop all over the place.
But the point is,

1041
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:32,780
is that,
you know,

1042
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:33,823
if you're,
if you're trying to build yourself into 

1043
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:40,280
the sort of person who can withstand 
tyranny and not contribute to it and can

1044
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:41,114
keep the adversarial side of their 
personality under control and can 

1045
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,470
tolerate tragedy without becoming 
embittered by it,

1046
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,250
then you're trying to hammer yourself 
into a particular kind of shape.

1047
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:56,030
And I would say that shape is 
approximated by figures like horace,

1048
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,864
for example,
or even more accurately the combination 

1049
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:03,020
of horace and no cyrus.
And the way you do that is by rectifying

1050
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:03,854
your faults.
And one of the advantages to having 

1051
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:06,674
someone else around is that if you can 
get a dialogue going that's predicated 

1052
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:11,504
on truthful exchange of information,
then you can repair your flaws and that 

1053
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:19,340
makes you way tougher and it makes the 
other person way tougher.

1054
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,201
You know?
And,

1055
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:23,210
and there's all sorts of things that go 
along with that that are very good.

1056
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:25,400
So,
so if you're not cynical,

1057
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,030
one of the things that you might say is 
that when you fall in love with someone,

1058
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,333
you're allowed a glimpse of what they 
could be and then that alerts you to 

1059
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:39,350
that possibility.
Now it's just a possibility.

1060
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,810
You're not going to get there without a 
tremendous amount of work.

1061
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,390
So the window opens and you can see 
through it.

1062
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,180
Some of that's going to be delusioned 
based on your own,

1063
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,510
you know,
faulty viewpoints.

1064
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:54,680
But controlling for that,
the window opens up.

1065
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,320
I think the latent inhibition is 
stripped off for a little while.

1066
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,530
And so you can see the person as they 
might become.

1067
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,503
And then that closes.
And then if you're careful and you 

1068
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,374
worked diligently,
then you can start making that 

1069
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,374
possibility into an actuality.
And that's then that the benefit from 

1070
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:18,590
that is that you do build yourself more 
and more into the sort of person that is

1071
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:22,120
working for the betterment of reality 
instead of four.

1072
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:26,570
It's perversion and destruction and 
that,

1073
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,793
you know,
so I said the ultimate external rang of 

1074
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:31,604
the dom of the value hierarchy.
Something like are you going to work to 

1075
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:35,054
make being better or worse?
So that's like the battle between good 

1076
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:40,070
and evil fundamentally,
which is why it's architectural.

1077
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,710
And then the innermost ring is,
well,

1078
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:47,300
are you going to manifest a heroic 
stance in the world,

1079
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,163
which means that your eyes are open and 
you're willing to take on difficult 

1080
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,033
problems and not shy away from them.
Or are you going to be primarily 

1081
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,544
adversarial in your role and 
communication between someone who's 

1082
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:02,180
close to you?
The bond,

1083
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,370
and this is why from the union 
perspective,

1084
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:05,204
the viral is actually necessary is you 
won't do the God damn work if you can 

1085
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:11,510
run away.
And it's a very interesting idea.

1086
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:12,344
I believe it to be true.
I believe it to be true because I think 

1087
01:02:15,141 --> 01:02:15,974
in many situations there's no damn way 
you're going to reveal what you're like 

1088
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:23,340
to someone unless you know they cannot 
run away.

1089
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,920
Okay.

1090
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,460
So partly because it's embarrassing,
partly because it's difficult,

1091
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:30,830
partly because it's frightening.
You know?

1092
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,650
And it's strange too because it's very 
frequently the case,

1093
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:36,250
and this is part of the union idea of 
the shadow,

1094
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:37,084
is that those terrible things that you 
want or even that you've done are 

1095
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:44,240
sometimes pointers to parts of your 
personality.

1096
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:48,260
They are incredibly powerful and strong,
you know?

1097
01:02:48,261 --> 01:02:50,810
So for example,
here,

1098
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:51,644
here's a,
here's an archetypal way of looking at 

1099
01:02:53,121 --> 01:02:53,954
it.
So one of the things I've noticed about 

1100
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:59,450
men,
and I think this is a universal truth,

1101
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:00,284
is that,
and this has to do with the bifurcation 

1102
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:06,570
of the feminine archetype,
is that right on the,

1103
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,493
on the positive and there's basically 
the Virgin Mary on and on the neck off 

1104
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,780
for all intents and purposes and on the 
negative.

1105
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:15,300
And there's like the whore of Babylon,
you know?

1106
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,330
And so for men,
the Virgin Mary part,

1107
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:20,190
his mother,
sister,

1108
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,290
daughter,
roughly speaking.

1109
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,000
So those are asexual relationships and 
the relationships that are fundamentally

1110
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:32,210
predicated on positive care.
And then there's mistress prostitutes,

1111
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:34,140
stripper over here,
you know,

1112
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:34,974
and the problem is,
is all the sexual energy is on the 

1113
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:41,280
negative side now.
And so what happens with the man is that

1114
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,470
okay,

1115
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,960
because they're not very sophisticated 
in their,

1116
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,213
in there

1117
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,120
psychological integration or in their 
worldview,

1118
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,870
there's no way they can tolerate a woman
who's both.

1119
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,510
So what they do,
because the negative,

1120
01:03:57,511 --> 01:04:00,330
the sexual element contaminates the 
purity.

1121
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,110
And so what they do,
men do this to their wives all the time,

1122
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:05,940
is that every time,
once they get married,

1123
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:08,880
every time their wife does anything 
that's vaguely sexy,

1124
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,850
they punish her by commission or 
omission.

1125
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:15,090
Like you're not going out in that are 
you?

1126
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,690
You know,
if you say that to your wife 20 times,

1127
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:19,703
it's like she's going to be dressing 
like a 50 year old peasant in no time 

1128
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:23,460
flat.
You know,

1129
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:26,070
because she's going to be not only 
responsive to that,

1130
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,083
it's also very easy to hurt someone if 
they go to the trouble of trying to 

1131
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,270
manifest themselves as attractive and 
you punish them for that.

1132
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,463
That's a much more effective punishment 
than telling them that they're not 

1133
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,760
looking very good when they're not 
looking very good.

1134
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,770
At least they can expect that.
Right.

1135
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:44,604
It's not polite,
but to punish them when they're doing 

1136
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:49,290
something that in some sense is virtuous
and that's it.

1137
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:49,871
You know?
Neat.

1138
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:53,910
You said it's,
if you really want to punish someone,

1139
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:54,744
you punish them for their virtues and 
what he meant by that is that's when it 

1140
01:04:57,781 --> 01:04:59,790
really hurts.
Now you might say,

1141
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,350
well,
why would the man do that?

1142
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,101
Well,
first of all,

1143
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:04,380
he's uncomfortable with the idea that 
mother,

1144
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,333
sister,
daughter could have any element of 

1145
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:10,650
sexuality whatsoever because that 
contaminates the purity.

1146
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,813
But then there's also his own resentment
and insecurities and the way they 

1147
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:16,500
manifest themselves is,
well,

1148
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:19,300
I'd rather you were at home fat,
ugly and unhappy.

1149
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,880
Then out there potentially attracting 
another man.

1150
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,700
And that's a pretty damn vicious way to 
live.

1151
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:25,953
And all it does eventually is turned 
into mutual contempt because the man 

1152
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:34,330
produces what he's aiming at and the 
woman hates him and no bloody wonder.

1153
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,763
So,

1154
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:37,543
so

1155
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,580
part of you might think like in a 
relationship,

1156
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:49,710
because it has to encapsulate sexuality,
there's all sorts of demands and desires

1157
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:52,950
that might manifest itself within the 
confines of the relationship.

1158
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,383
You know,
and those are the desires that may have 

1159
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:01,290
to be fulfilled in many cases with a 
relationship outside the marriage.

1160
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,333
Right?
So that would be almost a purely sexual 

1161
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:04,194
relationship very often.
But that only becomes necessary when 

1162
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:10,860
that isn't allowed and encouraged inside
the relationship.

1163
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,230
That's a very complicated thing.
First of all,

1164
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:15,930
each partner might have to admit to what
they actually want.

1165
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,303
Well,
cause people are very unlikely to do 

1166
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,820
that.
They're afraid of it and so,

1167
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:22,770
and they or they think there's something
wrong with it.

1168
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,910
Well everything that's powerful.
Sexuality included.

1169
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,383
I mean you only have to know trifle 
about Freud to understand that has a 

1170
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,980
tremendously dark side.
Sexuality and aggression.

1171
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:36,660
I mean,
those things are dangerous.

1172
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,810
And part of the way people deal with 
them is they just don't get very good at

1173
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:41,160
either of them.
You know?

1174
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:44,580
And then that's not helpful because it 
means they're primitively aggressive and

1175
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:45,414
primitively sexual and then they do all 
sorts of unsophisticated things at a 

1176
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:50,760
whim,
not helpful.

1177
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,840
So all that has to be tangled up inside 
the relationship too.

1178
01:06:54,841 --> 01:06:56,160
And that's very,
very difficult.

1179
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,060
They'd have an affair when they're 
drunk.

1180
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,533
Right?

1181
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,790
Which is often why people get drunk.
Well really,

1182
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:13,624
you know,
I mean that's why people get drunk so 

1183
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:17,380
they can do stupid things that are fun 
obviously.

1184
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:21,100
And no wonder because it's fun to do 
stupid things that are fun and it's even

1185
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:24,070
more fun to do them when you're drunk,
but it's not.

1186
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,113
But if you're the least bit awake,
you try to make sure that you don't put 

1187
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:34,750
yourself in a situation like that at a 
point of maximal temptation.

1188
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,630
And like if you're resentful,
for example,

1189
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,240
you're just waiting for an opportunity 
to cause trouble.

1190
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:45,420
So those

1191
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,343
absolutely,
I mean one of the things that this is 

1192
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:53,240
part of the union idea of encountering 
the shadows.

1193
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,470
You have to watch what you fantasize 
about.

1194
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,703
Now lots of fantasies look pathological,
especially if they're dealing with 

1195
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:01,734
material that has been repressed.
Because what happens is that like the 

1196
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,910
more sexually unsophisticated and 
useless you are,

1197
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,043
the more resentment is going to be 
tangled up in your fantasy and the more 

1198
01:08:12,991 --> 01:08:15,650
extreme that's going to become,
you know,

1199
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,573
so

1200
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,110
you work backwards,
give or take.

1201
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,263
So

1202
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,621
more,
more,

1203
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:24,730
more,
more.

1204
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,350
That's kind of a Friday an idea.
So that would be a catharsis idea.

1205
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,160
Relieving pressure.
What I would say,

1206
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:32,980
it's better to think about it from a 
Piagetian perspective,

1207
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:37,900
which is how do you turn that into a 
game that can be played in a sustainable

1208
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:42,340
manner across large stretches of time 
without disrupting your entire life.

1209
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,560
You know?
And what part of what that might mean if

1210
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:47,500
you're an adventurous sort of person and
you'd like to cause trouble,

1211
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,693
is that you better figure out how to 
cause quite a lot of trouble within the 

1212
01:08:51,521 --> 01:08:52,354
confines of your life in a way that 
doesn't disrupt the entire structure 

1213
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,450
because that's what you're like.
You're going to need trouble.

1214
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,553
You know,
and maybe you were going to marry 

1215
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,770
someone who likes trouble and so,
Hey,

1216
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,620
away you go.
You know Eric Norman,

1217
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:10,270
who was one of most most apt students,
most able students,

1218
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,283
he wrote a book at the end of the second
world war called depth psychology in a 

1219
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:16,450
new ethic.
And in there,

1220
01:09:16,451 --> 01:09:21,130
one of the things he recommended was 
don't try to be better than you are.

1221
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,850
And he didn't mean don't strive for 
perfection.

1222
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:28,060
He meant that for,
for example,

1223
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:31,630
if you're having an extremely violent 
fantasy about your father,

1224
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:33,670
let's say,
and it's so violent,

1225
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:35,530
you don't even want to let it into your 
head,

1226
01:09:35,531 --> 01:09:36,364
it's like you better bloody well let 
that thing play out and see what it 

1227
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,384
means.
And it's going to mean all sorts of 

1228
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:43,540
things that you are not comfortable 
with.

1229
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,213
But

1230
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,913
that doesn't mean that the impulse 
that's driving that isn't something 

1231
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,784
that's absolutely necessary for you to 
integrate so that you can be powerful 

1232
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:56,580
enough to survive without being corrupt.

1233
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,130
Okay.

1234
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,050
So,
and it's no joke,

1235
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,303
it's no joke because one of the things 
that you've said about the shadow and 

1236
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,053
the shadow in some senses,
the adversarial element of the 

1237
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:08,744
individual,
but it can also be the tyrannical 

1238
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:15,740
element of the state and it can be the 
pathological element of Mother Nature to

1239
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,810
those things are all sort of tangled 
together,

1240
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:20,090
right?
Because like your most violent,

1241
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,790
aggressive fantasies,
assuming you have such things,

1242
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,090
you can think of them as a manifestation
of the dark side of nature.

1243
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,830
That sort of an analogy to Freud's ID.
So,

1244
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,673
or you can think of them as only 
emerging as a consequence of the fact 

1245
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:36,290
that you are tyrannized by a society 
that is out of kilter.

1246
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:37,641
You know,
you know,

1247
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:41,690
each level of explanation has its 
relevance and its place,

1248
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,363
but

1249
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,170
it doesn't matter where you localize the
impulse.

1250
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,980
The question is what do you do about it?
And you know,

1251
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:00,330
one of niches observations was he said 
morality is cowardice.

1252
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,343
And what he meant by that was that most 
of what people claim to be moral virtue 

1253
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,863
is merely their fear to do anything that
they would actually like to do that 

1254
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:13,444
society would deem inappropriate.
It has nothing to do with morality 

1255
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:17,094
whatsoever.
And what they do is say I moral not I'm 

1256
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:23,010
cowardly.
And part of the reason,

1257
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:23,844
for example,
why people are so attracted to bad guys 

1258
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:29,820
stories,
you know,

1259
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,120
crime criminals and serial killers and 
all those sorts of people,

1260
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,870
Vampires.
And you know that that whole destructive

1261
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:39,810
force is because those

1262
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:42,523
characters aren't fearful.
They're just what other people there 

1263
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,040
just what people would be like if they 
weren't afraid.

1264
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,290
Okay,
so then you might say,

1265
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,124
well,
should you act in a manner that isn't 

1266
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:57,980
inhibited by fear?
Well,

1267
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:01,070
maybe then you turned into a mafioso or 
a psychopath.

1268
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,413
Well,
obviously that's not necessarily the 

1269
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:05,804
final element of worship there.
Maybe there's something past that where 

1270
01:12:10,941 --> 01:12:12,920
you have those things under your 
control,

1271
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,023
but it's not obvious to me that the 
criminal in certain circumstances isn't 

1272
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:22,724
more moral than the virtuous person.
If the virtuous person is just 

1273
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:27,104
abstaining because of fear,
then all they are is a cowardly 

1274
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:30,644
criminal.
And then you know when that's an that's 

1275
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:34,490
an idea that's,
well it's,

1276
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,353
it's a,
it's a neat chain idea in some sense 

1277
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:38,850
that was elaborated in large part by 
you.

1278
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:40,910
You know,
so,

1279
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,870
because one of the things you have to 
ask yourself is like if you're in a,

1280
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:47,750
if you're in an organization and someone
is bullying you,

1281
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:53,120
what needs to be at your fingertips 
before you will stop it?

1282
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,103
And the answer to that is you have to 
have enough force to stop the person 

1283
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:01,294
from doing it.
And that's going to take this same kind 

1284
01:13:04,661 --> 01:13:06,700
of forest that in some sense that,
uh,

1285
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,140
impulsively violent hell's angels.
Biker is capable of manifesting.

1286
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Now that doesn't mean that you should be
all admiring of the hell's angels biker,

1287
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:18,663
you know,
because that's not an integrated and 

1288
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:23,044
stable solution.
But it also means you shouldn't assume 

1289
01:13:27,911 --> 01:13:31,630
that your weakness constitutes a virtue 
because it doesn't,

1290
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,753
it just,
it's just a place of weakness where 

1291
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:38,620
degeneracy can flourish.

1292
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:44,780
So the pattern in their wife,
combination of roles,

1293
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:58,690
what's sort of the flip side of the 
bifurcation of like Neverland,

1294
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,373
honor kind of thing and how that 
sexuality for women looking at and then 

1295
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:13,490
how can we then raised in that kind of 
tie furcation can possibly grow up to be

1296
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,410
sort of deposit and or she's in the 
Virgin Mary,

1297
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,244
which is like desirable while also sort 
of paying homage to the fact that they 

1298
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:22,300
have sexuality.

1299
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,730
That's the question.
That's seriously,

1300
01:14:26,731 --> 01:14:31,731
I mean I would say in some sense that's,
that's one of the prime moral questions.

1301
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,980
So here,
here's the situation.

1302
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,833
It's like how friendly you should you be
with your husband's friend if you're 

1303
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:41,284
attracted to them.

1304
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:46,420
Okay,
well you have to think this through very

1305
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:47,530
carefully,
right?

1306
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,560
Because the answer isn't not friendly.
The answer also listen,

1307
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,800
no sexual provocation whatsoever because
that takes a huge chunk of the spice out

1308
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:02,074
of human interactions.
It has to be Tz with limits and the 

1309
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:07,954
limits have to be very,
very firmly evident and continually 

1310
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:14,050
manifest.
And then it's fun.

1311
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:15,813
And then if you're like,
if your husband had it is any sense and 

1312
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:18,424
he can trust you,
then what that means is that the whole 

1313
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,043
energy of the whole situation is,
is elevated big part of it because 

1314
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,660
there's no reason to deny sexual 
attraction.

1315
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:34,390
The question is what the hell do you do 
with it?

1316
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,030
And part of that is,
well you,

1317
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,750
you make it subservient to the greater 
whole and that,

1318
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,840
and you have to decide what that is.
I mean we've been talking about that to,

1319
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,213
to,
you know,

1320
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,390
I already mentioned today what sort of 
being you should aspire to be.

1321
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,223
You know,
you should be someone who can stand up 

1322
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:56,440
in the face of tragedy and tyranny and 
your own appalling lack of virtue.

1323
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,520
You know,
that's,

1324
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:00,300
that's a really,
that's a wonderful thing to aim at for,

1325
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:03,520
for all sorts of self evident reasons.
And then the question is,

1326
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:04,354
well,
how do you tangle sexuality up into 

1327
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:06,221
that?
Well,

1328
01:16:06,221 --> 01:16:09,670
not by repressing it.
I would say by using it as a,

1329
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:10,863
as a sophisticated ability and that 
takes practice and it takes 

1330
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:20,350
encouragement and it takes attention and
vision and it also takes the willingness

1331
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,184
of your partner to allow that to occur.
And that's not going to happen without 

1332
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:25,714
trust.
And that's not going to happen without 

1333
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,313
honest.
So it's a funny thing because what that 

1334
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:34,810
means that is honesty and trust opens up
the door to gains.

1335
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,180
And if,
if you're good enough at those games,

1336
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,180
you might not have to go outside of your
relationship for excitement.

1337
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:44,770
You might be able to get enough 
excitement exactly where you are

1338
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:50,100
and question a bit of a stretch.
I see you're out in the more,

1339
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,490
more often.
Um,

1340
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,580
are those people in a way doing the same
thing but with [inaudible]?

1341
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,200
No,
they're just delusional.

1342
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:05,823
Yeah.
I don't think there's any evidence 

1343
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:13,010
Soever I've never seen anyone in a 
relationship like that who's actually,

1344
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,100
who actually has a clue about 
relationships.

1345
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,293
There's delusion and somewhere in there 
it's like the friends with benefits 

1346
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,740
arrangement.
It's like,

1347
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:24,680
no,
that doesn't work.

1348
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,450
There's a whole bunch of reasons.
I mean,

1349
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:27,284
first of all,
it presumes that you can detach 

1350
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:33,320
sexuality from emotional commitment.
I mean every 16 year old,

1351
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:37,850
what admirer of porn believes that or 
would like to believe it,

1352
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:40,760
but it's not in the least bit true.
How could it be?

1353
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:46,450
So then it's also predicated on the idea
that both partners are equally committed

1354
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:49,130
and attracted.
And that's never true.

1355
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,820
One person is always way more attracted 
in a situation like that.

1356
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:54,860
Then the other,
even if they don't want to admit it,

1357
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,293
you know,
and then there's the idea that you can 

1358
01:17:58,221 --> 01:17:59,054
have a friendship and introduced 
sexuality into it and it's still a 

1359
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:03,560
friendship.
It's like no that's not right.

1360
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,320
I mean the,
the levels of naivety that,

1361
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:11,590
that are underneath the idea that 
something like that could be possible is

1362
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,480
mind boggling.
It's like,

1363
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,920
so this is fairly common.

1364
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,250
Well,
so is stupidity,

1365
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,013
you know,
I don't mean with your generation in 

1366
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:23,660
particular.
I don't,

1367
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:24,523
you know,
I don't,

1368
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,820
I certainly like people talk about 
younger people as being more foolish and

1369
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:31,850
self obsessed than you know,
baby boomers.

1370
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:32,684
But you can bloody well forget that they
were the most self obsessed generation 

1371
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:36,130
in the world.

1372
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:38,710
I wasn't saying that it's common as a 
justification.

1373
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,800
That as a segue to the question of what 
you would advise for some people.

1374
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,920
Well the thing is is people are deeply 
confused about relationships and it's no

1375
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:46,970
bloody wonder.
I mean,

1376
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,953
the reason they're confused about 
relationships is because of the birth 

1377
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,220
control pill.
I mean,

1378
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:56,150
that's a biological mutation of,
of massive proportions,

1379
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:56,984
right?
It's probably the biggest biological 

1380
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:03,611
event that hit the human race,
that hit that hit animal life.

1381
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,700
Ever since sexuality evolved,
this is a big deal.

1382
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:08,563
Like no female creatures I've ever had 
voluntary control over the reproductive 

1383
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:13,940
status before.
So,

1384
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:14,943
and it's only,
that only happened in 1960 it's like 

1385
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,430
that's yesterday.
It's a blink of an eye.

1386
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:21,170
And so everybody's trying to sort that 
out.

1387
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,790
Nobody knows what the hell to do about 
it,

1388
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,150
but you know,
what do you do with autonomous women?

1389
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,583
They're annoying,
they're interesting and attractive and 

1390
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:30,794
they do all sorts of bizarre things,
but they're so damn complicated that 

1391
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:34,610
they don't know what to do with 
themselves.

1392
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:39,470
And neither do men.
So everybody's struggling along with how

1393
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:40,304
to deal with that.
And then that all gets contaminated 

1394
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:43,244
with,
you know,

1395
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,630
stupid wish,
fulfillment,

1396
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:45,464
resentment and ignorance and willful 
blindness and general stupidity and to 

1397
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:49,940
produce all sorts of,

1398
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:52,370
okay.

1399
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,370
Completely harmful solutions.
So,

1400
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,410
so,
and we could go,

1401
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:01,303
look,
let's go back a little bit and let's go 

1402
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:05,930
back to those dimensions of life.
Just because you guys can argue this out

1403
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:06,531
with me.
You know,

1404
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:07,800
I'm,
I'm perfectly happy to,

1405
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:09,510
to,
to hear what you have to say.

1406
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,553
What I've observed is that in order for 
you to have enough pillars underneath 

1407
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:17,760
you,
because you don't want to be knocked out

1408
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:19,980
by a single event,
it's not good.

1409
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,640
And single events that are capable of 
knocking you out are on their way.

1410
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,653
Some of you,
no doubt have already experienced them 

1411
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,990
and there's,
there's going to be many of them in your

1412
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,820
life.
So you need friends.

1413
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,530
How many?
That's an open question.

1414
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:35,383
[inaudible] is the wrong number,
especially for men because it turns out 

1415
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:41,880
that men without friends seem to be 
unhappier than women without friends.

1416
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,103
So,
but that doesn't mean women don't need 

1417
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:45,234
friends.

1418
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,030
You need an intimate relationship of 
some sort,

1419
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,093
you know,
and I would say in the absence of a 

1420
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:52,944
better theory,
you should do it traditionally because 

1421
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,710
the probability that you're going to 
spin out of your own experience,

1422
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,600
a solution that's better on average than
the traditional solution is zero.

1423
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:08,010
You don't have the lifespan to do it.
So unless you get really lucky,

1424
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:11,790
you know and stumbled into it,
but it's very unlikely you need,

1425
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,103
you need to do something that's of 
benefit to the collective and it's 

1426
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:19,050
reciprocally beneficial to you.
That's usually a job.

1427
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:21,720
Or if you're lucky it's a career which 
would even be better.

1428
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:27,530
You need a family of some sort because 
otherwise you're just too isolated.

1429
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,763
Especially when you get older.
So in that probably is going to involve 

1430
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:36,120
children and I think children are 
probably 30% of life,

1431
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,030
maybe more.
They might be 50% of life,

1432
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:39,864
but there's certainly 30% you need to 
figure out what you're going to do with 

1433
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:47,040
your time outs,
with your own private time.

1434
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,890
You need to figure out what you're going
to do with that,

1435
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:52,220
that's valuable.
Um,

1436
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,153
and you have to watch your health.
And that partly means making sure that 

1437
01:21:56,221 --> 01:21:59,250
you don't fall down various drug and 
alcohol abuse holes.

1438
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,653
So,
and then you keep yourself relatively 

1439
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:02,724
intact and like,
I don't think that's everything you 

1440
01:22:04,531 --> 01:22:06,660
need,
but if you're missing any one of those,

1441
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,483
then you're weaker.
Now you could probably miss one or even 

1442
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:14,070
two of those who still be fundamentally 
okay.

1443
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,353
You know,
because I don't think you need to stand 

1444
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:19,170
on six legs,
but you certainly need to stand on three

1445
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:22,530
or four.
And so one of the things I would suggest

1446
01:22:22,531 --> 01:22:23,364
is that,
and I would say also learned this from 

1447
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,770
young,
is do not deviate in too many directions

1448
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:29,604
at the same time.
You're lucky if you can deviate in one 

1449
01:22:32,131 --> 01:22:34,380
direction without blowing yourself 
apart.

1450
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,740
Because as soon as you deviate,
then you're in a chaotic domain.

1451
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:39,750
And there might be a lot of possibility 
in there.

1452
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:40,783
There are no doubt is.
But the idea that you can tolerate that 

1453
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:47,700
is it's possible,
but it's unlikely.

1454
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:51,360
That's why most people are conservative.
So now,

1455
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,830
so then the next issue in part is,
well,

1456
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:57,690
how do you meld all those things 
together?

1457
01:22:57,691 --> 01:23:00,390
And that's partly why I told you about 
the Ph Eddie and ideas.

1458
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:05,440
Because I think that that the idea that 
what you're trying to do is to produce a

1459
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:10,441
sustainable game that can be implemented
across large sections of time.

1460
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,300
That's not an inhibitory model,
right?

1461
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:14,134
It doesn't mean while you should just 
crush your regression or crush your 

1462
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,400
sexuality,
or it doesn't even mean that they should

1463
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:21,220
be sublimated,
which is the Friday and alternative.

1464
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,054
What it means is that those capabilities
should be made sophisticated so that 

1465
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,720
they're actually in play all the time.
You know?

1466
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:31,810
So if you see somebody who is 
sophisticated and aggressive,

1467
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:35,140
they are aggressive all the time,
always in everything they do.

1468
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:36,580
But it's,
it's,

1469
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,410
it's more like power.
It's not,

1470
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:42,250
it's not impulsive Dick Damage.
So it's an,

1471
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,790
it's an unbelievably useful thing to 
have at hand,

1472
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:49,090
partly because it enables you to say no 
and you need to be able to say no.

1473
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,250
Because if you can't say no,
then you're a slave

1474
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,393
so

1475
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,940
well.
So then you might ask,

1476
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:56,710
well,
how do those problems get solved?

1477
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,810
Well,
one of the things I can tell you is that

1478
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:00,183
marital union is a human universal.
So the probability that something like 

1479
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:09,030
that is the right solution is it's 
canonical.

1480
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,370
Well,

1481
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:13,980
maybe you can find a better solution,
but I wouldn't count on it.

1482
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,913
So

1483
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,053
yeah.
And there's other things that people 

1484
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:22,434
don't take into account that,
and that's partly because I think that 

1485
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,520
we refuse to admit them.
Um,

1486
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,740
the temporal course of life is radically
different for women than it is for men.

1487
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,330
And men have a much larger horizon to 
play around with and women do.

1488
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,480
And so,
man,

1489
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:41,490
can I,
like I have friends who got married when

1490
01:24:41,491 --> 01:24:43,350
they were in their late fifties and had 
children.

1491
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,960
You know,
that's not,

1492
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:48,060
it's not that uncommon,
you know,

1493
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:50,100
and they're doing fine.
You know,

1494
01:24:50,101 --> 01:24:50,934
both the one man I'm thinking about,
he married a woman from the third world 

1495
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:55,403
and he treats her far better than she 
ever expected to be treated by anyone 

1496
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:00,983
you know.
And they have a child and he is 

1497
01:25:02,521 --> 01:25:05,880
absolutely dotes on the child and 
everything seems to be working out fine.

1498
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:08,490
But as a general rule,
that's not an option for women.

1499
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,133
And so women have to solve most of the 
problems in life before they're 40 

1500
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,183
probably before they're 35 and so that's
a real problem and no one talks about 

1501
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:19,714
it.
No one will admit to the existence of 

1502
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:21,544
that problem.
So what the reason I'm saying that is 

1503
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:25,654
because what that means is that women 
have less time to experiment with 

1504
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:28,954
alternative.

1505
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,300
Okay.

1506
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,133
Modes of sexual being than men do 
because the price they paid for losing 

1507
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:38,070
the time during the experimentation is 
prohibitively high.

1508
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,000
Not that I would say that this is true.
There are obviously exceptions,

1509
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:46,043
but just think about in some ways it's 
better that women kind of pop this 

1510
01:25:53,391 --> 01:25:54,224
limited opportunity.
Cause I have one friend who's 29 years 

1511
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,150
different and she resentenced her mother
so much for it.

1512
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,370
And that's probably what her father

1513
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,600
you think because of the age difference.

1514
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:08,523
Yeah,
because she died when she was 10 so men 

1515
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:12,063
can still like,
you know when you're on your deathbed 

1516
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,860
you can probably still have a kid.
Like I can't.

1517
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,753
But isn't that kind of a good thing?
Because even though so many people have 

1518
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:25,330
kids when they shouldn't,
at least women,

1519
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,200
this is a weird argument,
I feel like,

1520
01:26:28,201 --> 01:26:29,034
I mean like antifeminist but at least 
women eventually stop having that 

1521
01:26:33,161 --> 01:26:33,994
opportunity thing.

1522
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,133
I want to feel like you're opening up a 
bigger question and one of the bigger 

1523
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:45,790
questions that you're opening up is the 
utility of radical limitations.

1524
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:51,070
So people always assume that more choice
is better.

1525
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,473
It's not necessarily the case.
I mean part of the reason that modern 

1526
01:26:55,031 --> 01:26:55,864
people torture themselves to death is 
because their horizon of choice is 

1527
01:26:58,331 --> 01:27:00,910
staggeringly large.
What should I do?

1528
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,310
Well,
you know,

1529
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,330
if you're trying to dress a three year 
old,

1530
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,740
the three year old says,
I want to pick what I'm going to wear.

1531
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:10,770
But then the three year old looks in the
closet,

1532
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:13,090
it's like that's it.
They're stuck.

1533
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,133
What you do is you lay out two things,
have two options of closing on the bed 

1534
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,470
and you say,
do you want this one or that one?

1535
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,900
And they're perfectly happy cause they 
got to choose.

1536
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,093
But the choice horizon isn't so large 
that it is anxiety producing in and of 

1537
01:27:28,421 --> 01:27:29,254
itself.
So there is some utility in tight 

1538
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:33,010
limitations.
You know,

1539
01:27:33,011 --> 01:27:33,844
it's something to actually meditate on 
with regards to the fact that life 

1540
01:27:36,341 --> 01:27:38,620
itself is finite.
You know,

1541
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:40,680
because people don't like that idea.
I said,

1542
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:42,760
well wouldn't it be better if we could 
live forever?

1543
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,623
It's like

1544
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:50,370
are not that fond of the idea that I'm 
not going to be here in 40 years.

1545
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:56,550
And I thought about it a lot,
but it isn't absolutely obvious to me to

1546
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:57,384
what degree that should be extended.
And if it was whether or not that would 

1547
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:02,730
be better.
So then that,

1548
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:05,820
that brings up the deeper question,
which is well,

1549
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,633
okay,

1550
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:10,103
the relationship between the fact that 
things are limited and the fact that 

1551
01:28:12,781 --> 01:28:13,614
they exist at all.
Like there's a relationship between 

1552
01:28:16,651 --> 01:28:19,140
limitations in existence.
So for example,

1553
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:23,490
there's a lot of things you can't do 
while you're playing chess because there

1554
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:24,324
are rules to playing chess.
But the fact that those rules are there 

1555
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:30,600
and that there limits means that you get
to play chess.

1556
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,100
And that's a weird thing,
right?

1557
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:34,920
Because what you,
what you've done is taking a large field

1558
01:28:34,921 --> 01:28:35,754
of possibility.
You could play any game and you're 

1559
01:28:38,401 --> 01:28:38,911
saying,
well no,

1560
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:41,550
here's 10 arbitrary rules.
It's like Poof,

1561
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,533
all of a sudden there's an actual game 
that you can play that has virtually 

1562
01:28:45,511 --> 01:28:48,660
infinite possibility in it.
And there's something about that.

1563
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,093
Like it seems to me that like we're 
constrained potential and that unless 

1564
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:58,200
the constraints were there along with 
the potential,

1565
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,930
there wouldn't be any way of actualizing
anything.

1566
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,680
You know that the root where genius 
comes from Jeanie

1567
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,193
and a genie is this magical thing that 
can do anything except it's cramped 

1568
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:17,040
right up in this little tiny container.
So it's this weird combination of divine

1569
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:21,810
possibility and stringent limitation.
And that's what human beings are like.

1570
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,400
And they complain about the limitation,
lack or limitation might be a creek.

1571
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,130
I think limitation is a precondition for
being,

1572
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:32,610
I believe it.
And then the issue is,

1573
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:33,683
well,
if limitation is a precondition for 

1574
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:35,934
being how best to handle the limitation.
And I really think that's the central 

1575
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:42,630
question of morality.
Now the,

1576
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:43,763
the point you're making is,
well maybe it's not such a bad thing to 

1577
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:49,530
have a time horizon.
It's like I would say,

1578
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:52,470
well it depends on what you do about the
time horizon.

1579
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:54,863
So one of the things that I see that 
really torture is modern people is the 

1580
01:29:58,321 --> 01:30:01,550
availability of divorce.
You know,

1581
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:03,240
it's a weird thing to think about,
right?

1582
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:05,940
But you know,
people will ask themselves,

1583
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,440
well,
is this a relationship I should be here?

1584
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:10,270
Well,
okay,

1585
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,950
try finding a relationship where you 
won't ask that question.

1586
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:18,120
You want to be tortured by that question
for the rest of your life,

1587
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:22,410
or do you want to just solve it once and
then do something else?

1588
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,050
While that's,
that's a tough question,

1589
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:26,663
but I believe it's better to solve it 
once and then to move on to other 

1590
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:31,524
things.

1591
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:38,200
Well,
I certainly don't think that's something

1592
01:30:38,201 --> 01:30:39,550
to aim for.
You know?

1593
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,340
You know what?
I know they don't think people do.

1594
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:46,670
But you can make a case that if there's 
an escape route,

1595
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:53,250
you don't sacrifice everything to making
it work.

1596
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:54,893
And I don't think you can make a 
marriage work without sacrificing 

1597
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:59,310
everything to it.
It's too hard.

1598
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,760
And so if you leave open the back door,
then you don't have to commit to it.

1599
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:08,400
You don't actually have to commit to it.
And if you don't commit to it,

1600
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:11,580
I'm going to work.
Well,

1601
01:31:11,581 --> 01:31:12,414
even if you don't leave,
you're going to be tortured by the 

1602
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:16,320
possibility that you could.

1603
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,823
No.

1604
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,361
Yes,
that's right.

1605
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:22,570
It's if it's,
yes,

1606
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,840
yes,
yes.

1607
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:25,861
No,
you know,

1608
01:31:25,861 --> 01:31:26,694
I'm not saying this is right.
I'm also not saying the divorce 

1609
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:29,664
shouldn't be allowed,
although I think the fact that we 

1610
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:31,974
casually introduced it into our culture 
in the late 1960s was an absolute 

1611
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:35,874
catastrophe.
I think all the evidence suggests that 

1612
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:38,904
because what's happened now is that the 
only people who get married and stay 

1613
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:45,150
married are rich people.
So,

1614
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:47,280
I don't know if you guys know that,
but you know,

1615
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:50,880
if you stratify society by socioeconomic
status,

1616
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,133
it's the middle class and above have 
long lasting permanent marriages and 

1617
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:59,040
usually have children within them.
Below that,

1618
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:04,700
it's serial relationships usually have a
relatively unfulfilling kind,

1619
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,393
single motherhood and excess poverty.
And it's almost all for women because 

1620
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:15,310
women almost always have,
they almost always have young,

1621
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:18,370
the young children,
they're granted custody or it just works

1622
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:19,204
out that way in the relationship.
So it isn't obvious to me by any means 

1623
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:27,790
whatsoever that that's constituted an 
improvement for the majority of children

1624
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,340
or the majority of women.
Oh,

1625
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,273
well for that matter,
I don't think it's constantly didn't 

1626
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:36,570
improvement for the majority of men.
So now these are all I'm,

1627
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:38,763
you know,
I'm,

1628
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:42,580
I'm not stating these as facts,
I'm stating them as observations.

1629
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:44,570
This is how it is appeared to me.
And

1630
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,230
some things you have to be all in for 
him.

1631
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:52,700
Okay.

1632
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:57,700
Or you can't get what they might offer.
You can't hedge your bet.

1633
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:00,320
No,
I've already said that.

1634
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:03,080
Doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to 
survive on your own.

1635
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:08,780
I think you're actually more likely to 
be the kind of partner who can battle in

1636
01:33:08,781 --> 01:33:12,200
a relationship if you could live on your
own,

1637
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,630
because then you can say no.

1638
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:18,063
Oh.

1639
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:19,050
Oh,
okay.

1640
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:21,570
Okay.
All right,

1641
01:33:21,571 --> 01:33:24,960
so let's take a break and then I want to
read you something.

1642
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:30,290
I want to go through a story with you.
So let's take a break for 10 minutes.
