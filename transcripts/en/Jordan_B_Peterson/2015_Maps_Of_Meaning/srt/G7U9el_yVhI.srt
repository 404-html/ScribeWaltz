1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
It happened,
so now we've got to the point where the 

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:03,780
story says,
well,

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,390
human beings became self conscious and 
here's,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,253
here's the problem with that.
The problem is is that we're terribly 

5
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:15,111
self conscious about our inadequacies in
or vulnerabilities and that that sets up

6
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,164
enmity between men and women and it 
dooms women to pain in childbirth and 

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,220
child rearing and a dooms men to work.
It's a big problem.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,623
Okay,
so now the next story that comes up in 

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,710
the sequences in the story of Cain and 
Abel.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,053
Now you know we talked about the dragon 
of chaos and then the terrible mother 

11
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:36,204
and the creative mother and on the 
tyrannical father in the secure father 

12
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,814
and then the adversary and the hero.
Cain and Abel are the first 

13
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:45,864
manifestation of the adversary in the 
hero and what happens is they emerge as 

14
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,530
soon as the genesis,
the original genesis story.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,363
And so what the story basically proposes
is that once people became self 

16
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,440
conscious to modes of being emerged as a
consequence of that,

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,790
and one mode is represented by Cain in 
the other mode is represented by Abel.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
And that's echoed in the story of the 
hostile brothers in stories of hostile 

19
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,680
brothers everywhere,
but it's also paralleled in Christianity

20
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,440
by the idea of the relationship between 
Christ and Satan.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,550
So it's like Cain and Abel are 
precursors to the idea of Christ and,

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,563
and,
and,

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,300
and Satan.
Now what happens is that,

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
so kane is the older brother and that 
makes him sort of the embodiment of 

25
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,224
tradition.
He would also be the favored one in 

26
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:33,894
terms of the traditions of the ancient 
Israelites because he would be the one 

27
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,920
that inherits everyone,
so everything.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,340
So he's actually the one that's,
he's the embodiment of tradition.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,200
And there's some advantages to that 
because he's privileged because of it.

30
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,034
But there's some disadvantages because 
to the degree that culture itself has 

31
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,610
become sterile and inappropriate and he 
manifests that.

32
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:57,180
That means that he manifests error by 
merely being what he was.

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,710
Now what happens with and enable is the 
young is the young brother.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,563
So

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,410
Abel was a keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

36
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,783
Okay.
So there's,

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,160
there's a,
there's a dichotomy of,

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,173
of professions here.
And people have read that in all sorts 

39
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:21,994
of different ways,
but one of the ways that you can think 

40
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:26,950
about it is that there are valid 
different modes of being in the world,

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,980
you know,
so you can be in this situation,

42
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,190
you can be a tiller of the ground or a 
keeper of animals,

43
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:34,024
but in the world in general,
you can adopt any number of roles that 

44
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,350
suffice.
It can be a plumber,

45
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,180
you can be a lawyer.
Um,

46
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,540
and there are,
there's,

47
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,453
there's ways of acting within those 
roles that transcend the roles 

48
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:46,984
themselves.
And so that's part of what's being 

49
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:51,970
exemplified in Cain and Abel.
So they can,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,190
they can function in the world despite 
their different.

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,840
They're different roles.

52
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,123
In process of time,
it came to pass that cain brought the 

53
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,320
fruit of the ground and offering unto 
the Lord and Abel,

54
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,810
he also brought of the firstlings of his
flock and of the fat they're up.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,680
Now that's very archaic,
the idea of sacrifice.

56
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,050
Okay?
So basically what happens is that you're

57
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,884
trying to get God on your side.
And so God seems to want something from 

58
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,470
you because he's keeps demanding this 
and that,

59
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:18,310
so you might say,
well,

60
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,144
reality wants something from you once 
you to behave in a certain way so that 

61
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,330
you don't suffer any more than you have 
to win so that things go well for you.

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,523
Now human beings at this point in time,
or trying to work out exactly what that 

63
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,854
means,
and they've already gotten to the point 

64
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:31,954
where they're conceptually sophisticated
enough to understand that that means 

65
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,800
that sacrifices are necessary.

66
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,053
Now you remember that it's only prior to
this that human beings discovered time 

67
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,931
itself,
right?

68
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,764
That's when they discovered that their,
they become self conscious and discover 

69
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,154
their extension across time.
And so one of the consequences of 

70
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,664
realizing that your extended across time
is that you also will come to the 

71
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,204
realization that you may have to let go 
of certain valuable things right now in 

72
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,900
order to make things work better in the 
future.

73
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,840
And you can't imagine that people just 
woke up and figured that out.

74
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,493
I can took people.
God only knows how long to sort that 

75
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,214
out.
It's tens of thousands of years to come 

76
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,490
up with that realization.
First of all,

77
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,920
they would have acted it out like bees 
do.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,170
You know they collect honey and they 
make it through the winter,

79
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,610
but they don't know what the hell 
they're doing.

80
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,600
Or maybe they do.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,420
Maybe they're little super computers 
like these bloody adams,

82
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:22,330
but you know what I mean?
You can act as sort of thing out without

83
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,164
realizing what you're up to and the 
motif of sacrifice seemed to be exactly 

84
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,394
that.
People stumbled onto the dramatic idea 

85
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,184
that if you gave up something of value,
there would be some reasonable 

86
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:36,160
possibility that God would smile on you 
in the future.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,290
Okay,
so.

88
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,270
So that's why there's the sacrifices.
Now you might say,

89
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,550
well why did they burn them?
And the reason for that is,

90
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,140
well,
as far as I can tell,

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,790
people are trying to understand what the
ultimate fabric of existence is.

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,624
And I think that you can feel that 
sometimes and one of the places that 

93
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:56,290
people feel that regularly is when 
they're out at night and they look up at

94
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,124
the sky and they see this immense 
blanket of eternity that's laid out 

95
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,940
before them and that induces a feeling 
of all.

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,013
And I think that that archaic people 
took the notion of that all that was a 

97
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:14,440
consequence of this apprehension and 
associated that with some something like

98
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,530
communion with the divine,
which is actually quite reasonable.

99
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,420
Because when you aren't looking out into
space,

100
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,880
you are looking into the farthest 
reaches of being.

101
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,223
You can see back millions,
hundreds of millions of years back into 

102
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:30,460
time and you see you gaze out into the 
infinite expanses of being.

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,653
So it's not unreasonable to assume that 
in some sense at that moment you have 

104
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,200
some connection with what's infinite.
Whatever that happens to be.

105
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
And I think that you feel that rather 
than thinking.

106
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,913
So anyways,
the idea basically emerged that the 

107
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,780
divine was up in the sky and that 
because the divine was up in this guy,

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,793
you could maybe communicate it with it 
by sending messages up there and one of 

109
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,484
the ways you could do that was with 
smoke and so if you're burning these 

110
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,324
things that you're offering,
you get to push the smoke up to God and 

111
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,454
he can do a molecular analysis and see 
if what you're offering is of any 

112
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,930
reasonable quality.

113
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,580
And if it seems to me,
then Poof,

114
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,170
you know God's going to be thrilled 
about that.

115
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,303
Or maybe he's not.
Now what happens is that keynes 

116
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,293
offerings are rejected and ables 
offerings are accepted and so what that 

117
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,364
means is that cane gets the short end of
the stick and able gets everything good 

118
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,704
happening to him.
So what you see happening is that 

119
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,453
there's the notion of two paths of being
one that's favored in one that isn't 

120
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:28,934
favorite.
Now the story is very ambivalent about 

121
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,050
why Kane is not favored.
Enable is,

122
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,580
and you,
you can,

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,740
you can read it multiple ways.
You can just say,

124
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:37,574
well,
God's basically being a son of a bitch 

125
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,524
and he's not going to give cane anything
just because he's not in a very good 

126
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,490
mood that day,
or you can say,

127
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,324
well,
ables doing something right in Kane 

128
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,124
isn't,
and I think that interpreting the story 

129
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,464
in either of those ways is,
is perfectly illuminating because part 

130
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,184
of the time in life it seems like 
someone's doing everything right and 

131
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,380
still they're just getting laid waste 
left,

132
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,214
right,
and center and someone else is doing 

133
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,790
something terribly and things are going 
well for them and,

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,833
but then you also see the reverse where 
someone who's doing well gets rewarded 

135
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,060
and someone who isn't doesn't.

136
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,490
So there's an ambivalence about it.
Now.

137
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:13,760
I think the story does indicate that 
Cain is doing something wrong,

138
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,730
but it doesn't do that until later.
So anyways.

139
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,263
Sorry,
let me just go down to the next section 

140
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,484
here.

141
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,310
So what it came enables sacrifice in the
biblical version cited here,

142
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,144
the nature of cane sacrifices left 
unclear except that it is over the 

143
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,850
ground.
It's vegetative and therefore bloodless.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,860
Every canonical tail,
however,

145
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:56,290
carries with it a surrounding cloud of 
similar stories,

146
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,124
some derivative,
some the product of a different 

147
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,134
developmental path and tradition,
some intermingled with other stories in 

148
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,990
some variants.
Cane sacrifices not only of the ground,

149
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,220
but it's of low quality.
Cain is unwilling to offer up the finest

150
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,054
fruits of his labors to go out.
That's he does not really sacrifice 

151
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:13,564
anything.
He wants to keep everything good to 

152
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:17,830
himself,
so he selfish as well as faithless.

153
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,980
Able by contrast,
offers up the best of what he has.

154
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,650
What does this mean?
Once again,

155
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,080
we already know we say to our children,
do your best.

156
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,153
Do not hide your light under a Bushel.
We do not say conserve your baster or 

157
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,330
hide your best.

158
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,930
We mean offer the best you have.
Do it in good faith.

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,150
You will not be absolutely assured of 
success,

160
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:37,984
but your chances will be into increase 
to the degree that such increased as 

161
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,374
possible.
Certainly it's an overstatement to say 

162
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,194
that if you do not believe this,
you at least wish with all your heart 

163
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:48,670
that it was true.
This is hope to not believe.

164
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,730
This is to risk descent into the deepest
chasms of cynicism.

165
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,410
So what happens?
God accepts able sacrifice,

166
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,244
offers him respect and renders his life 
acceptable despite its terrible 

167
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,900
limitations.
Cane sacrifice,

168
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:04,330
however he rejects this drives cane into
a murderous rage,

169
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,273
rage.
So the Lord God had respect unto Abel 

170
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,514
and his offering,
but unto Cain and his offering he did 

171
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,340
not have respect.
So the idea basically is that Abel makes

172
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,600
these sacrifices.
He's gay,

173
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,360
he's putting forth the best that he has.

174
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,640
He's doing his best.
And because of that,

175
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,800
it's actually working.
Everyone likes able,

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,820
you know,
he has,

177
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,700
he's getting along with his wife's,
his flocks are increasing.

178
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,950
And so he's a good guy.
It's like everything's going well.

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,190
Whereas Cain,
things aren't going very well at all and

180
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,050
no one really cares for them.
And besides that,

181
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,480
he's burning with jealousy because you 
know,

182
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,314
despite the fact that he's slaving way 
raising all these vegetables and trying 

183
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,020
to offer them to God,
nothing is going his way.

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,840
So not only are things going badly for 
him,

185
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,540
but he's increasingly disaffected by it 
and you know,

186
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,090
you,
you,

187
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,923
it's not difficult to understand that 
you know perfectly well that what 

188
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,794
happens to you if you're working away,
you think diligently and properly and 

189
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,534
nothing is going your way and some other
son of a bitches just flourishing like 

190
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,404
mad beside you,
that that's going to make you vengeful 

191
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,940
and,
and irritated and anxious and angry and,

192
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,910
and homicidal for that matter.

193
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,670
And it doesn't take very long before 
people reached that stage,

194
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,730
at least not in their fantasies.
Now the story says,

195
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:20,760
and Cain was very wroth and his 
countenance fell.

196
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,780
And what that meant is he's angry and 
his face changes to indicate that.

197
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,614
So he's got this continual look of 
perpetual dis affectation and anger on 

198
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,680
his face because things aren't going 
well for them.

199
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,873
So that's fine.
So then he goes and has a chat with God 

200
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,040
because he's not very happy about the 
whole situation.

201
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,110
And I think people do that all the time 
to,

202
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,080
even if they don't necessarily formulate
it in those terms,

203
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,730
it's like they're thinking,
well,

204
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,564
what's the nature of reality?
I'm busting myself in half here trying 

205
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,520
to make things work properly and 
nothing's going well.

206
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,500
It's like what kind of stupid universe 
is that?

207
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,723
And for all intents and purposes,
that's a colocoy with God because you 

208
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,074
don't start thinking about the ultimate 
fabric of reality without bringing 

209
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,610
religious intuitions into it.

210
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,623
You can't even ask such a question 
without acting in a quasi religious 

211
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:08,880
manner.
So this is what happens.

212
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:09,714
It took me a long time to unpack this.
So he goes and has the cha chat with 

213
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,190
Yahweh,
with God,

214
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,490
and the Lord said to Cain,
why are you angry and downcast?

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,593
Surely if you do right,
you ought to hold your head high sin 

216
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:24,360
crouches at your door,
lusting for you,

217
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:28,200
yet you can master it.
Now that's very,

218
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,360
very interesting.
So I translated those.

219
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:34,200
I got a translation to those lines from 
a guy named miles from 1995.

220
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,093
Now it's so what happens is the king 
goes and has a chat with God about how 

221
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,030
things aren't going very well and 
basically what he's trying to do is hold

222
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:42,864
God to account for why he made such a 
stupid universe where everything keeps 

223
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:50,481
going wrong and what God says to him is,
why are you angry and downcast?

224
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,743
If you do right,
you ought to be able to hold your head 

225
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,694
high.
So there's an intimation there that the 

226
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:56,914
reason the cane is wandering around like
this is because there's actually 

227
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,184
something he's doing that's not correct.
It's not that the structure of reality 

228
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:04,274
has got a problem,
it's that cane has a problem and god 

229
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:06,641
says,
well,

230
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:09,610
if you just do things properly,
then you could stand up.

231
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,790
You wouldn't have to be a defeated 
lobster all hunched over and aggravated.

232
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,803
You could stand up and you know,
hold yourself properly and be the be 

233
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,800
thoroughly integrated in a proper manner
with the way being is unfolding.

234
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,634
And then he says,
sin crutches at your door lusting for 

235
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,610
you,
yet you can master it.

236
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,560
Now,
that's a very interesting line.

237
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,980
So I found out that there is a,
there is an under,

238
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,713
there's a metaphorical context within 
which those lines are attorney and 

239
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,370
here's the context.

240
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,720
So God basically tells Kane that sin,
which is misbehavior,

241
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,554
is a kind of personality and the 
personality that he associates it with 

242
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,783
is something like a sexually aroused 
predatory cat and he tells Kane that 

243
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:56,974
he's no canes in house and that thing is
crouching at the door and it's waiting 

244
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:00,934
to jump on it.
And then he tells Kane that that that's 

245
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,730
a real threat and it's right there,
but he could,

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,980
he could not have that happen if he 
wanted.

247
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,203
And there's a,
there's a whole set of inferences in 

248
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,930
there.
And one inference is cain invites it in.

249
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,910
Now you remember,
you may not remember,

250
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,860
you have to invite the vampire into your
house.

251
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,470
It can't just come in and of its own 
accord.

252
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,304
You have to open the door.
And so that's the first thing God tells 

253
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:23,951
Kane.
It's like,

254
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:24,784
yeah,
yeah,

255
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,530
sure.
Things aren't going very well,

256
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,364
but that things at your door,
you invited it in and you could master 

257
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:32,380
it if you want,
but you chose not to.

258
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,660
And then the next thing that that the,
the conceptualization of the CNS,

259
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,563
this sort of angry and lustful cap,
there's a sexual connotation to it and 

260
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,950
so the thing pounces on cane and has its
way with him,

261
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,173
so there's an idea that there's a,
like a sexual interaction between Cain 

262
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,830
and this force so that it's a creative 
interplay.

263
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,740
It's not only that he's dominated by the
sin,

264
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,783
it's that he brings it in and enters 
into a creative union with it and 

265
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:03,760
produces something out of the,
out of the mixture.

266
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,940
And so for example,
when I was reading the column by kids,

267
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:07,461
right,
it's,

268
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,760
it's like you can see exactly that in 
their behavior.

269
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,370
It's like he knew perfectly well what he
was up to.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,833
He knew perfectly well what he was 
inviting in and he put his own 

271
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:17,584
extraordinarily creative twist on it.
It wasn't just that he was possessed by 

272
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,484
an idea,
like he spent months planning with his 

273
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,244
horrible little compatriot about exactly
how they were gonna blow up the school 

274
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,904
and the town and they would have liked 
to have blown up the whole damn city 

275
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,963
that was part of their plan and exactly 
how they were going to turn that into a 

276
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:37,700
creative spectacle that would be covered
by networks all over the land,

277
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,420
perfectly consciously,
every single bit of this.

278
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,620
So they put their own twist on it as a 
consequence of being angry and resentful

279
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,360
and unhappy,
you know.

280
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,420
So anyways,
so God tells Kane,

281
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,260
um,
you know,

282
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,190
why are you coming to complain to me?
There's nothing wrong with reality.

283
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,920
It's like you get your act together and 
behave properly.

284
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,850
You can stand up,
Whoa,

285
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,803
hold your head up high and you don't 
have to let this thing that's tempting 

286
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,050
you have its way with you and enter into
a creative union with it.

287
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:06,884
You can just behave properly.
And so kane leaves and then he's really 

288
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,950
annoyed.
And the reason he's annoyed just because

289
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:13,784
he's going in there hoping that he'll 
straighten out with a little chat and 

290
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,933
sent reality straight,
and basically what he finds out is that 

291
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,784
as far as God's concerned,
the reason that all these terrible 

292
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:21,974
things are happening to him is because 
he's not anywhere near what he could be 

293
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,350
and he's setting himself up for 
continual failure.

294
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,230
And so that really annoys him.
So no,

295
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,510
not only is he mad about the fact that 
he's failing,

296
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
but he's even more mad because he 
thought it through.

297
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,434
He realized that it was actually his 
fault and that the reason these things 

298
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,580
are happening to him is because he's not
what he could be.

299
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,110
So then you might think,
well,

300
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:44,090
what does he do as a consequence?
You know,

301
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,871
you could think,
well,

302
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:45,704
he could say,
well,

303
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,920
little apology to God and try to get 
himself on the right track.

304
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,700
And that isn't what happens at all.
He goes and kills Abel with a rock.

305
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,621
Now you think,
well,

306
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,150
why does he do that?
Well,

307
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,010
that's very complicated.
It's partly.

308
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,380
Well,
Abel is obviously God's favorite.

309
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,603
So he's doing everything he can to pull 
them down and you think people do that 

310
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,920
all the time,
like if you're jealous of someone else's

311
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:07,754
accomplishments,
these things really played themselves 

312
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:13,460
out in junior high and high school,
but they also play out in in adult life,

313
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,990
you'll do everything you can to pull 
down the thing that's hovering above you

314
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:22,490
and making you look bad from as a 
consequence of the reflection.

315
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,470
It's easier to destroy the ideal than it
is to try to live up to it and people do

316
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,304
that all the time and then they're 
punishing each other for their virtues 

317
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,480
and they do that because,
well,

318
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,610
first of all,
because they can pull down the ideal and

319
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,190
then they don't have the mirror that 
makes themselves uncomfortable,

320
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,130
but they can also do that as revenge 
against God.

321
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,791
It's like,
well,

322
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,320
if that's what you favor and you're 
going to torture me to death,

323
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,173
then I'll just destroy what you've 
brought up to be the best manifestation 

324
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,434
of what is at this point.
And then we'll just see who's who's 

325
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,810
winning this war,
who's winning the war of being.

326
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,243
And so that's what happens.
He goes out and kills Abel and so God 

327
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,264
comes along.
It's a terrible thing because it means 

328
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,204
he destroys his own ideal,
but he's perfectly willing to pay that 

329
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:09,170
price as long as he can get revenge for 
his misery and his revenge on God.

330
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,213
And it's interesting too because if you 
look at the writings of people who 

331
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:17,060
commit real atrocities,
you can see that they've gone far beyond

332
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,450
any desire for individual revenge like 
the kids that people,

333
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,300
the columbine kids shot up in in the 
high school.

334
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,930
They didn't even necessarily have any 
grudge against those particular kids.

335
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,180
It was like mayhem for me,
him sake,

336
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,014
and it was actually better if they shot 
someone that was innocent because that 

337
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:36,170
was a lot more of a protest that is 
shooting someone who is guilty.

338
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,660
You know,
if you're shooting someone who's bullied

339
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,940
you,
it's like that's just gel.

340
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,630
That's just justice.
I mean,

341
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,464
it's a warped and bent form of justice,
but if you go into the high school and 

342
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,504
shoot someone who's been good to you,
well then you're really making a 

343
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:53,130
statement about just what you think 
about the world and if you're willing to

344
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,140
blow your head off afterwards,
well,

345
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,153
it's just that much more indication that
you could say to hell with everything 

346
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,480
and that nothing is worth having,
and that's like,

347
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
that's a,
that's a,

348
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,670
that's a demonstration of that mode of 
thinking right down to the bottom.

349
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,460
So anyways,
he goes out there and he kills Abel.

350
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,010
I'll read you this paragraph.

351
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,880
Kane is faced with a very stark choice.
His pride,

352
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,073
his belief in his own omniscience,
compels him to repeat actions that do 

353
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:27,140
not produce their desired outcome 
despite yourself to find failure.

354
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,213
This breeds a deep resentment.
Once his pride and resentment grow past 

355
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,890
a certain threshold,
he starts to fantasize about revenge and

356
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,220
then about murder.
The gap between fantasy and action grows

357
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,054
even smaller as resentment builds,
and one day the opportunity manifests 

358
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:43,490
itself.
Able says something optimistic,

359
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:44,324
deserving and promising,
and that straw that breaks the camel's 

360
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,560
back.
Perhaps it is.

361
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,670
At first it was just resentment of the 
successful deep resentment,

362
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,533
but it does not have to end there.
There's no real end with enough 

363
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,960
resentment.
You can kill once if you can kill once.

364
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,940
Why not 10?
If 10,

365
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,070
why not 100?
If 100,

366
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,710
why not 10,000?
Why not a million?

367
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,120
Sterling was just getting warmed up when
he killed 6 million Ukrainians in the 19

368
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:11,954
thirties.
There's evidence from the KGB archives 

369
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,904
that Stellan was preparing for the Third
World War when he was killed by his own 

370
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:21,560
people in the 19 fifties,
and who's to say that Hitler really lost

371
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,394
the war.
It depends entirely on what he was 

372
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:26,630
aiming for.
Maybe he got just what he aimed for when

373
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,464
he blew his brains out,
all over his bunker deep underneath 

374
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,430
Berlin,
while Europe burned to ashes around it.

375
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,480
Why do we assist upon believing that 
every tyrant fights award to win?

376
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,293
Cane believed that the world was a 
terrible and unreasonable place bent on 

377
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,770
his suction,
suffering and destruction.

378
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,280
He thought that hard work and sacrifice 
was for babies and fools.

379
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,670
This is from Richard the third.
Why should wrath be mute and theory?

380
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:53,440
Dumb.
I am no baby.

381
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,230
Alright,
that with based prayers,

382
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,220
I should repent the evils that I have 
done.

383
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,000
10,000
worst that ever.

384
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:01,660
Yet I did.
Would I perform if I might have my will,

385
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,090
if one good deed in all my life,
I did.

386
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,180
I do repent it from my very soul.
Eric Harris.

387
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:10,364
This is from Columbine.
The most literate of the two killers 

388
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:14,990
said,
I hate the fucking world.

389
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:17,570
Kill mankind.
No one should survive.

390
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,733
Most investigators of the columbine 
killings claim they cannot understand 

391
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,600
the boys motivations and they could 
understand them.

392
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:25,620
They just don't want to.

393
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,173
Harris said,
I would sooner die than be trained my 

394
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,530
own thoughts,
but before I leave this worthless place,

395
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,660
I will kill whoever id him.
Unfit.

396
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,123
Harris transformed himself into an 
archetypal embodiment of Cain who's 

397
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,740
ultimate prototype is motivated 
according to girth.

398
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,880
That by the following principle,
so this is Mephistopheles.

399
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,660
The spirit I endlessly denies and 
rightly to,

400
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,553
for all that comes to birth,
is fit for overthrow as nothing worth 

401
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,480
were for the world.
We're better sterilized.

402
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,970
That's all that's here is evil,
recognized his game to me and downfall,

403
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,980
downfall,
runes sin,

404
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,563
very element.
Prosper in Harris the day before his 

405
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,810
mass murder,
about 26 point five hours from now,

406
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,280
the judgment will begun.
Begin difficult but not impossible.

407
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,770
Necessary.
Nerve wracking,

408
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,190
and fun.
What fun is life without a little death?

409
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,570
It's interesting when I'm in my human 
form knowing I'm going to die.

410
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,090
Everything hasn't touched of triviality 
to it.

411
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,500
With Harris,
the leader.

412
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,573
Yeah,
so what happens then is God finds caden 

413
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:46,620
has a little chat with him and he says,
when you tell the ground,

414
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:49,800
it will not hence forth yield on Unti 
unto the her strength.

415
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,670
He'll be a fugitive and a vagabond.
And cain said unto the Lord,

416
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:55,680
my punishment is greater than I can 
bear.

417
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,810
Behold though it's driven me out of this
state,

418
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:00,510
from the face of the earth and from thy 
face shall I be hidden,

419
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on 
the earth.

420
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,230
And that it shall come to pass that 
everyone who finds me will slay me,

421
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,040
and the Lord said,
therefore whoever slayeth Cain,

422
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,903
vengeance shall be taken up on him.
Seven fold and the Lord set a mark on 

423
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,100
Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him.

424
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,593
Now what happens in the,
in the aftermath of that story seems to 

425
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:23,940
be something like that.

426
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,100
So there's cane and then Adam and eve 
have another son who's name is seth,

427
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:29,934
and Seth produces descendants and one 
and one of them down the chain is Noah 

428
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,003
and he saves the world from the flood.
But cain produces descendants two and 

429
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,940
each of the descendant generation seemed
to get more and more aggressive.

430
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:42,774
And the generation that produces a man 
named Tubal tubilcain seems to be the 

431
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,440
same generation as no on the other 
branch and Tubal.

432
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:54,060
Cain is by tradition the first person 
who produces our artifacts,

433
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,163
tools of warfare.
And so there's an idea in the old 

434
00:22:58,231 --> 00:22:59,064
testament in this story that it's the 
individual murderous resentment of the 

435
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:03,924
individual who won't make the proper 
sacrifices that distributes itself into 

436
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:11,220
the community and culminates in 
increasing brutality,

437
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:16,221
atrocity.
And finally into war Tubilcain T U B a l

438
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,300
Dash c a r I n,
yeah.

439
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:28,680
And so lamb neck is one of the,
one of the,

440
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,690
uh,
Kane Kane's descendants.

441
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:34,230
And this is lamb economic kills two men 
when he is wounded and hurt,

442
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,490
and Lamach says unto his wives,
Ada and Zillah hear my voice is wives of

443
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:43,230
Lamech Hearken unto my speech for why 
have slammed a man to my wounding

444
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,280
and a young man to my hurt.
If cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly

445
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,410
Eq,
70 and seven fold.

446
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,680
So there's this,
the idea of the exponential distribution

447
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:55,514
of brutality into the community as a 
consequence of this initial adoption of 

448
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,680
a particular form of being.
Okay.

449
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:05,681
So here's the situation that's laid out 
in genesis as far as I can tell,

450
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,644
is that people emerge as self conscious 
and not produces a terrible burden on 

451
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:11,384
people.
And then the burden is even either 

452
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,880
handled in the appropriate manner with 
the proper sacrifices or it's not.

453
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,043
If it's not,
the consequences are that everything 

454
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:25,001
degenerates into brutality and atrocity.
And that seems to me to be approximately

455
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,444
correct.
And so you can understand both cane 

456
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,530
enables motivations,
you know,

457
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,430
cain gets brutal and resentment full 
because things don't go well for him and

458
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,070
because he's suffering and it might be 
arbitrary,

459
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,740
you know,
and sometimes you're suffering does seem

460
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:40,574
to be entirely arbitrary,
but part of the moral of the story is 

461
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:47,000
that if you allow that to make you 
resentful and vengeful,

462
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,043
that you'll participate in processes 
that make things absolutely unbearable 

463
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,200
and make the entire situation much 
worse.

464
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,423
And all the existential commentary I've 
read on the things that happened in the 

465
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:58,964
second world war and in the Soviet Union
and in China for that matter seemed to 

466
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:04,424
lay out exactly the same story,
which is once individuals get corrupted 

467
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,910
because they're unhappy with the 
structure of their being,

468
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,923
they can corrupt the entire social 
landscape and the entire world and 

469
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:15,524
things go from bad to worse,
until they're as bad as they can 

470
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:21,470
possibly be.
So that's how things go badly.

471
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,371
You might think,
well,

472
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:23,810
how do things go well?
And,

473
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,090
you know,
unfortunately we missed one lecture,

474
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,190
but there's some things that I can tell 
you that I,

475
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,520
that I think I know about.
What,

476
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,890
what are you laughing about?

477
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,111
No,
no,

478
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:36,950
no,
no.

479
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:37,400
Well,
there's,

480
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
there's other things that I wanted to 
tell you about,

481
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,063
but I can tell you about this anyways.
I just can't do it in quite as much 

482
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,094
depth as I would have liked to.
So it doesn't seem to me that it's 

483
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,970
reasonable to try to impose an 
ideological solution on the world.

484
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,073
And the reason that that's not 
reasonable is because it leads you into 

485
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:53,954
something that's akin to ascend.
The pride you think you have the damn 

486
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,554
answer.
You think you know everything and you 

487
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,660
can impose that answer.
But the problem with that is that it,

488
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,553
it seems to,
that's the kind of sacrifices that 

489
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:06,554
produces the kind of sacrifices that God
doesn't find very acceptable and things 

490
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,050
go from bad to worse.
So you might say,

491
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,340
well,
what's the alternative?

492
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,950
What's the potential alternative mode of
being?

493
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,330
And so here's something that you can 
think about.

494
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,183
And,
and,

495
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,263
um,
there's one thing that I want to tell 

496
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,800
you about Christianity that's relevant 
in this regard.

497
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,150
So you know,
you can,

498
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,840
you'll see this in the last quarter of 
the maps of meaning when you read it,

499
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:30,674
but there's,
there's images that have popped up in 

500
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:32,864
the middle agents where the tree of,
of the tree in the garden of Eden is 

501
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,694
there again.
And on the one side of the tree there 

502
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,960
are skulls and those are being handed 
out by eve.

503
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,560
And on the other side there are these 
little things that are liked fruits,

504
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,633
but they're representatives of the hosts
that are given to people when they 

505
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:54,060
undergo the mass in Christianity.
And so those little hosts which are made

506
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,490
out of wheat,
which is a dying and resurrected God,

507
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,563
are like the body of the hero.
And so the idea behind the masses that 

508
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,673
in order to overcome death,
you're supposed to incorporate the body 

509
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,030
of the hero and the body of the hero.

510
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,410
The hero is the person in this 
mythological landscape who is willing to

511
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:15,411
voluntarily confront death and will as a
consequence be reborn.

512
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,033
Now I think that that can be ran at,
at a psychological level because we 

513
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,304
already talked about the fact that one 
of the things that happens when you're 

514
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:23,964
in deep error is that you can allow the 
erroneous structure to dissolve into 

515
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:32,100
something that's chaotic and then have 
it reemerged as something that's new.

516
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,243
The idea that's lurking behind this idea
of transformation is that you should 

517
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:41,010
identify yourself not with the initial 
state of order,

518
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:41,844
which is like a particular way of 
looking at the world and you shouldn't 

519
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,354
identify yourself with the state of 
chaos that's there when everything 

520
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:50,670
collapses around you,
but did,

521
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:51,504
you should identify yourself with the 
process of transformation from order 

522
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,900
through chaos and then into a new form 
of being.

523
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,003
And so the way that you confront the 
fact that reality is continually 

524
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:06,360
transforming is by allowing yourself to 
transform with it.

525
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,330
And that's the volunteer.
That's the voluntary.

526
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,670
That's the taking on of the voluntary,
um,

527
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,050
that have continual voluntary death and 
rebirth in the service of higher being.

528
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
And we don't know the potential limits 
to that.

529
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,553
You know,
I mean obviously in their current 

530
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:26,120
situation,
um,

531
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,383
everyone is still faced with the 
possibility of ill health and a finite 

532
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,460
lifespan and all of the things that go 
along with that,

533
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,294
but we don't know the limits of our 
potential dynamic flexibility and we 

534
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:37,554
sure do know that if you hold onto ways 
of being that are counterproductive for 

535
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:42,240
any length of time,
that,

536
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,700
that kills you faster and makes you more
miserable.

537
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:45,534
Well,
it's happening.

538
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,030
And the same thing happens as well when 
you're,

539
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,083
you know,
wallowing and trapped in a chaotic 

540
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,010
situation.
So.

541
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,010
So here's a hypothesis.
So you know,

542
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,903
one of the things that the new agers 
will tell you is that you should follow 

543
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,204
your bliss.
And I have a big problem with that 

544
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,470
because first of all,
I don't think it's true and second,

545
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,670
because you pointed out that if you do 
fall in what you find deeply meaningful,

546
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,970
it's likely to take you to a place that 
you're most afraid of.

547
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,553
And so to me,
there's a barrier to enlightenment and 

548
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:16,890
the barrier is that

549
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,453
you'll face things that will pull you 
apart before you'll face things that'll 

550
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,023
put you together.
And I think that what you faced that 

551
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:25,334
will pull you apart is all the things 
that you've done in the past that have 

552
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:28,454
been Sabala suboptimal.
Those things have to be repaired and 

553
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,540
fixed.
Now.

554
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,863
If you put yourself in a situation where
you're able to rectify the errors that 

555
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:40,574
you've made in the past,
so that you straightened out the manner 

556
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:43,984
in which you're organized,
then I think that it might be possible 

557
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,214
to live so that your forthrightly 
confronting things as they move towards 

558
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:55,150
you and if you're oriented towards 
making them better,

559
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,180
like assume that that's your highest 
value.

560
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
Say Well,
what's the purpose of life?

561
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,554
And the purpose of life is to make 
things as good as you can possibly make 

562
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,304
them.
And that might be for you and it might 

563
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,750
be for those around you.
And you might not even know exactly what

564
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:10,330
that means.
So sometimes you're going to have to let

565
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:14,020
go of what you think good is as you 
progress towards it.

566
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,753
Well,
it seems to me that if you orient 

567
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:22,831
yourself towards that and you allow 
yourself to stop living in,

568
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,293
in,
in theories that you know to be false 

569
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:30,700
and carrying false hoods,
that you're acting out and,

570
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,330
and believing in that you know to be not
true,

571
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,820
but you can start to live in a different
way.

572
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,810
Okay?

573
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,020
So here's the different way in some 
sense.

574
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,933
So

575
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,173
the first thing you have to figure out 
is that you don't know what the hell 

576
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:56,514
you're doing.
The second you have to think to figure 

577
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,510
out.
And that's humility.

578
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:01,344
I think the second thing you have to 
figure out is what you want and you 

579
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:07,170
either want things to be better or you 
want them to be worse,

580
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,363
and there's reasons for wanting them to 
be worse and the reasons are deep and 

581
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:14,580
they're justifiable,
but they're not helpful.

582
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,140
So then let's assume that you noticed 
the part of you that's devoted,

583
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:19,974
like cane to the destruction of things,
and you understand what that is and 

584
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,200
you're willing to take it onto yourself 
to repair.

585
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,190
Then it isn't other people's evil that 
you have to worry about.

586
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,950
It's your own.
Then you might say,

587
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:35,070
well,
what should you do next?

588
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,653
And one of the,
one of the pieces of literature from 

589
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:40,254
which I've learned from that seems to 
address that is the sermon on the mount 

590
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:46,560
in the New Testament.
And one thing that happens in the sermon

591
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,394
on the mount is this.
So Christ says to his followers that 

592
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:52,190
they should,
they're there.

593
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,920
There isn't something specifically that 
they should be pursuing.

594
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,143
What they should be doing instead of 
just orienting themselves in a 

595
00:31:59,011 --> 00:31:59,844
particular direction and the direction 
would be towards what's best and what's 

596
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,573
true.
So that's the first step is you figure 

597
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,470
out,
do you want things to be better?

598
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Do you want them to be worse?
That's the fundamental question.

599
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,334
So are you working for the betterment of
being or for its transformation into 

600
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,114
hell?

601
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,171
Then you think,
well,

602
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,510
I want things to be better than the next
thing you think is,

603
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,344
well,
you don't exactly know how to go about 

604
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:24,630
that.
Okay,

605
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:26,970
so then what do you do?
Well,

606
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:31,971
it seems to me that that's the point at 
time when you try to eradicate from your

607
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,180
field of apprehension,
everything that you know to be false and

608
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:39,710
unworthy,
you get rid of it as much as you can,

609
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,544
as fast as you can,
and part of the way you can do that is 

610
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,214
by listening to what you say and 
watching what you do and you can listen 

611
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:48,644
to what you say and you can find out if 
you're actually saying what you believe 

612
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,844
to be true.
Now here's the hypothesis and I think 

613
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:56,744
this is the hypothesis that's laid out 
in the transformation from the Old 

614
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,790
Testament to the New Testament 
Christianity,

615
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,863
but I also think it's the same idea that
the Taoists were pursuing and the 

616
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:07,280
Buddhists we're pursuing.

617
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,430
So the idea is this,
and it's based on the idea of logos.

618
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,870
What would happen if instead of pursuing
what you think you should be pursuing,

619
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,493
you did something else,
which is you say to yourself in a 

620
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,644
position where you're trying to make 
things better and the next consequence 

621
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:29,930
of that is to try to say as clearly as 
what you pause as you possibly can,

622
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,250
what it is that you believe to be true 
in every situation,

623
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,310
and then to see what happens.
It's a different way of playing the same

624
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,144
game now in the sermon on the Mount,
what Christ tells his followers just to 

625
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:48,920
Orient themselves towards paradise and 
truth fundamentally,

626
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,293
and then to concentrate on doing 
everything they possibly can moment to 

627
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,700
moment as carefully and correctly as 
possible,

628
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,743
and then to see what happens.
So there's this ancient idea that set 

629
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,180
that root of Western culture that being 
is spoken into existence and that's the.

630
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,310
That's the,
that's the speech of the logo.

631
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,920
And the idea there is also partly that 
that inherits inside people if they,

632
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,580
if they're willing to utilize it and 
that they know how they can utilize it.

633
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:20,414
And the way to utilize that is to 
straighten out your speech and action 

634
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:29,230
and to act as well as you can moment to 
moment and to let go other than that and

635
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,030
see what happens.
Because,

636
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,290
and I think that that's the movement of 
faith that the existentialist Christians

637
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,660
continually talk about.
You can't.

638
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,363
Because the thing is,
if you're aiming at something specific 

639
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,394
that constitutes the good,
then basically what you've done is made 

640
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,230
yourself a kind of idle.
You said,

641
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,000
well,
this is paradise and God,

642
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,103
but the thing is you don't know that 
because you're not sufficiently 

643
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,314
informed.
Understand the ultimate nature of the 

644
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,820
good.
But I think you're sufficiently informed

645
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:01,550
to figure out when you're not using your
language properly.

646
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,893
And I think one of the things that you 
can notice is that if you're not using 

647
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,044
it properly,
it makes you ashamed and weak and 

648
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:10,190
embarrassed.
And I think you can feel that.

649
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,750
You can feel it fully embodied.
And I think that's what Kane does.

650
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,730
And that's what God tells them to stop 
doing.

651
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,220
And he says,
if you're doing things right,

652
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:21,170
you can stand up with your head held 
high.

653
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,453
And if you're not,
you can't your downcast and angry and 

654
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,950
resentful and murderous,
and I think that that's the case.

655
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,253
So,
and I do believe that it's a different 

656
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:36,020
way of being because it's not aimed at 
something.

657
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,910
It's not aimed something that's 
predefined.

658
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,983
You have to under,
you have to allow what constitutes the 

659
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:43,644
good and your understanding of the good 
to continually be updated as you pursue 

660
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:48,534
it.
And I think all you have to do to do 

661
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,880
that is to speak words well.
Northrop Frye would say is that you have

662
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,540
to speak words with power and I think 
you can learn to do that,

663
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,900
but you have to let go.
I think that that's the,

664
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,610
that's the cure for radiology,
you know,

665
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,473
because what's the alternative?
You can lay out a belief system and try 

666
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:11,450
to impose it

667
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,900
or you can play along and see if you can
figure out what's going on.

668
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:16,734
And if you have a productive 
conversation with someone that's what 

669
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,080
you're doing,
you know,

670
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,923
you say,
well,

671
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,270
let's see if we can figure out how to 
get along.

672
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,970
Maybe this is within the confines of an 
intimate relationship.

673
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,901
It's like,
okay,

674
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:30,320
what do you want?
What do I want?

675
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,023
How is that going to fit together?
Can we communicate honestly about 

676
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:36,830
exactly what that is and how we might 
get it,

677
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:39,320
and it's.
It's a process of coe discovery.

678
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,423
It's not like you know the answer to 
begin with and you're not going to find 

679
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:43,754
it unless you tell each other the truth 
and you're not going to be able to 

680
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:46,904
pursue it unless you act out the truth 
that you articulate and I don't think 

681
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:50,954
you're going to be able to articulate 
the truth properly unless what you want 

682
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:57,540
is the good and that's a very difficult 
thing to figure out.

683
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,374
But I think one of the things we do know
after the 20th century that the 

684
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,893
continual attempt to make the world as 
atrocious a place as possible seems to 

685
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,230
be searching in the wrong direction.

686
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,291
No.
You know,

687
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:13,280
I've tried this sort of thing for a very
long period of time because I think that

688
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,114
what I try to do or why,
what I try to do is to say what I 

689
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:17,174
believe to be the case in every 
situation that I'm in and to see what 

690
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,830
happens and my experience has been that 
really works.

691
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,173
I get really works.
You can learn to get along with the 

692
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:31,580
people in your family and help them 
straighten out and you can start to have

693
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:35,900
a relatively beneficial effect on 
processes that are outside of your,

694
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,883
you know,
of what's right in front of you and 

695
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:39,134
within your grasp so you can practice 
trying to figure out how to set things 

696
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:46,160
straight and I have no idea what the 
ultimate limits of that might be.

697
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,863
But I can tell you one thing.
It certainly makes your life and 

698
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,530
ridiculously interesting and you know 
that in itself is one of the things that

699
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,150
takes away the sting of mortality.

700
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,670
Because if what you're doing is so damn 
interesting,

701
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:02,390
you can hardly stand it.
The fact that you have to pay a price as

702
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:04,940
you move along starts to become 
acceptable,

703
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,310
you know,
because you'll pay a price if it's worth

704
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,071
it.
It's neat.

705
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:10,850
You said if you have a why you can bear 
anyhow,

706
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,640
and I think there's some truth in that 
and you know,

707
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,301
you might say,
well,

708
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:15,134
what's,
what's a good that sufficiently good to 

709
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:18,764
justify voluntarily participating in 
being that's bent on your misery and 

710
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:26,960
destruction.
That's the fundamental question of life.

711
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,983
Well,
I would say you need a pretty elevated 

712
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:29,774
vision in order to counteract that and I
think that's what a vision of paradise 

713
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:36,910
is and I think that paradise,
something that people have to build,

714
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,853
I think if we built it properly,
it would justify everything that 

715
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:45,130
happened on the way to building it.
Or at least that might be the case.

716
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,830
And I think you can do it locally first.

717
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,260
So.
And I can't see it.

718
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,103
I've watched people.
I've watched how people have lived live 

719
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:57,960
now for decades and I have two clients 
in my practice right now who've,

720
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,650
who one of them was pretty damn straight
to begin with,

721
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,980
but he's set up his,
his business.

722
00:39:03,981 --> 00:39:04,814
It happens to be a firm and he's tried 
to make absolutely straight decisions 

723
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:11,570
that were really informed and proper the
entire way along.

724
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:14,080
And the bloody thing is running like a,
like a,

725
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,840
it's running,
it's celebrated.

726
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,450
It's extremely effective.
It's not wasteful.

727
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:24,020
Everybody who was inside the 
organization is developing properly,

728
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,290
um,
no ones getting screwed over,

729
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,163
like it's,
it's an honest and straightforward 

730
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,000
enterprise and everybody seems to be 
benefiting from it.

731
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:36,290
And I have another client who was pretty
damn confused and arrogant and resentful

732
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,393
when he first started changing his life 
and he put together a relatively small 

733
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:45,050
business and I would say it's a low 
status business,

734
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:48,050
but he's done it as honestly as he 
possibly could.

735
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,440
And he tried to keep himself on the 
straight and narrow.

736
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,274
Well,
he's doing it and he's trying to give 

737
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:56,900
his customers outstanding service and to
be clear and straight with them at every

738
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:57,734
single choice moment.
And that's lifted his cynicism and it's 

739
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,910
made his business very,
very productive and positive.

740
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,200
And so I can't see.
First of all,

741
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,153
there has to be some antidote to 
theology because it's corrosive and 

742
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,650
destructive and I can't see that there's
any,

743
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,233
any and that you can attain at any means
that you can implement that's more 

744
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,043
meaningful and rich and deep than that.
And I do think it's sufficient to stop 

745
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:28,904
you from being corrupted and genocidal.
And that's a good thing because you can 

746
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,134
get corrupted and genocidal.
And if there's enough of us who were 

747
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,313
corrupt and genocidal,
then things are going to get very bad 

748
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,430
instead of very good

749
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,583
so

750
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,860
well.
So then you can think about that.

751
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:53,640
And I think it's an easy thing to to,
to start to try.

752
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,073
The first thing you have to do is decide
if you want things to be better or 

753
00:40:57,241 --> 00:41:00,210
worse.
And that's not a simple question because

754
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:04,050
there'll be a lot of you that's bitter 
and resentful and vengeful and angry for

755
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:06,570
all of your inadequacies in the way the 
world's treated you.

756
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,680
And so.
And the second thing is pay attention to

757
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:14,640
what you say and see if you believe it.
And if you don't quit saying it,

758
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,913
see what happens.
Like you can tell if what you say makes 

759
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:20,580
you stronger,
if it makes you weak,

760
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,020
oh you have to do is feel it and you can
stop saying things that make you weak,

761
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,850
but it'll change you completely.

762
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,803
So

763
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,243
you'll find that you won't be able to 
associate with people who only allow to 

764
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,150
say things that make you weak,
for example,

765
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,523
because lots of people would be upset if
you say things that make you strong 

766
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:39,404
around them because they don't want you 
to flourish and grow partly because it 

767
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,390
sheds a bad light on them.

768
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,643
Anyways.
This is more of elaborated in the last 

769
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,593
quarter of the book or there boats.
And so you'll get a chance to read that 

770
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:58,470
if you want to do it.
And I guess I'll see you guys when you,

771
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,800
when you have the final,
but in the meantime.

772
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,930
Well think about it.
You know,

773
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:04,764
I think we have more opportunity now at 
this point in history to make things 

774
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:08,844
good than we could have possibly 
imagined 50 years ago and it's 

775
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,210
necessary.
You know,

776
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,223
there's lots of things that are falling 
apart and people get cynical about that 

777
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:16,914
and that's the wrong attitude.
It's like you have no idea how much 

778
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,900
power you might have at your disposal if
you used it properly.

779
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,980
And I think we could set things right if
we decided that it was worth doing.

780
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,893
And so it certainly seems to me to beat 
the alternative because in the 20th 

781
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:35,880
century we bloody well learned what the 
alternative was and it is as horrible as

782
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:36,714
anything you could possibly imagine.
So it seems to me that it's very much 

783
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:42,210
worth a while avoiding that even if we 
can't make things perfect.

784
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,703
So

785
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,573
see you all.
