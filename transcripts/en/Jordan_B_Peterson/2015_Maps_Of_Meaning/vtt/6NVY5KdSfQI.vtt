1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing,</v>

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.023
<v Speaker 2>first thing I'm going to do is to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you what to do when you start speaking </v>

3
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 2>to an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because some of you will do that in your</v>

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a hint,</v>

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 2>when you stand up in front of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not talk to.</v>

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 2>They're all absolutely silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 2>because they'll quiet down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody will quite completely down.</v>

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.363
<v Speaker 2>Then you want to wait until just before </v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes awkward and then you've got </v>

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.514
<v Speaker 2>everyone's attention and if you speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>before then you're giving permission to </v>

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.014
<v Speaker 2>people to speak while you're speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you shouldn't give them that </v>

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.764
<v Speaker 2>permission because the hypothesis is is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have something reasonably </v>

12
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 2>important to say because otherwise the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole setup is ally,</v>

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just so you know,</v>

14
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also.</v>

15
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.483
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you one more thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking in front of people that's </v>

16
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 2>extremely useful too because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>frightens people.</v>

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.793
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do that,</v>

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I never talked to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:02.431
<v Speaker 2>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

20
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking in front of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

21
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 2>You might think that when you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really true.</v>

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 2>You're speaking to people in the group </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can move your attention from one</v>

23
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 2>person to another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you speak to the group,</v>

24
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be terrified because the</v>

25
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.224
<v Speaker 2>group doesn't give you any feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at individuals and talk </v>

26
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:20.994
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not that much different from </v>

27
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.604
<v Speaker 2>having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is because you have to be prepared </v>

28
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can judge when you're looking at</v>

29
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.454
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell whether they understand </v>

30
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.734
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're hooked in there or </v>

31
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as long as you're paying attention,</v>

32
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to utilize your </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural skills as a communicator which </v>

33
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 2>you've been practicing since you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>

34
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.463
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's two hints and they're useful </v>

35
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:45.924
<v Speaker 2>hints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

36
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 2>and I guess the other thing to remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that B,</v>

37
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 2>three hints is that it's really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue,</v>

38
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.493
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I think I told you this </v>

39
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.824
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the response from the people in </v>

40
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 2>the audience is nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's not a dialogue.</v>

41
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.893
<v Speaker 2>So if you're paying attention to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep the dialogue going and </v>

42
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>generally that'll keep everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest reasonably high.</v>

43
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well anyways,</v>

44
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 2>so I want to bring up some mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 2>about words.</v>

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.433
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

46
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 2>the first question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

47
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:25.954
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is a word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm talking about words because I'm </v>

48
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 2>really interested in concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a word is like a unit of,</v>

49
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conception.</v>

50
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 2>So I'll focus on words and will broaden </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to concepts.</v>

51
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I want to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about concepts is because I want to talk</v>

52
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:40.714
<v Speaker 2>to you about idiot logical and group </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification and such identification </v>

53
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>is based in part on shared behavior but </v>
<v Speaker 2>also in part on shared conceptions.</v>

54
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that I'm interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>group identity is because I'm interested</v>

55
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:59.911
<v Speaker 2>in what it is that motivates people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>retain their group identity and also to,</v>

56
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 2>to defend their group identity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanded often at the cost of warfare.</v>

57
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.913
<v Speaker 2>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm interested in why people </v>

58
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:11.674
<v Speaker 2>will do horrific things to one another </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order hypothetically to facilitate </v>

59
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>that process.</v>

60
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's the linkage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's think about words for a minute.</v>

61
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first question you might ask as </v>

62
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a word and St Augustine,</v>

63
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.133
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formally posited that the word was a </v>

64
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.074
<v Speaker 2>label for a thing and I would say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mostly what people think when </v>

65
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 2>they think about words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they don't do very often.</v>

66
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>They use them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't think about them.</v>

67
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>So a word to be a label for a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

68
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a funny concept because the thing</v>

69
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>is often defined by words and so there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of circularity in there,</v>

70
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:56.674
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because for that argument to be exactly </v>

71
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.064
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing would have to be self evident </v>

72
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.943
<v Speaker 2>sort of independent of any verbal </v>
<v Speaker 2>formalization and then you could just </v>

73
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:05.944
<v Speaker 2>slap a label on it and it's pretty clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our conceptual abilities also </v>

74
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>influenced the manner in which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive things.</v>

75
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's a reciprocal interplay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

76
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

77
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>that's one definition and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it has some utility.</v>

78
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.173
<v Speaker 2>So here's another definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from VIP can Stein that can </v>

79
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Stein said a word is like a player in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chess game.</v>

80
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.093
<v Speaker 2>One of the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant by that in part was </v>

81
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:33.184
<v Speaker 2>that you're engaged in an activity when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using language and the activity </v>

82
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 2>has a vaguely game like structure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you're using words is to</v>

83
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.504
<v Speaker 2>move ahead in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a player in the game and so then </v>

84
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>you can think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

85
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:52.591
<v Speaker 2>so that's another analogy that a word is</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a tool like structure and you use it</v>

86
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:53.494
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attain certain ends into operated in </v>

87
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind of an interesting way</v>

88
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:58.894
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was thinking about this is a </v>

89
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 2>more visual analogy.</v>

90
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a toy train and there's freight cars on </v>

91
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>it and you fill the freight cars with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different things.</v>

92
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.313
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one is full of screws and Legos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and another one is full of erasers and </v>

93
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.843
<v Speaker 2>coins and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a little tunnel so that the </v>

94
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.734
<v Speaker 2>train track goes underneath it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the train is continually running </v>

95
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 2>underneath it and that thing stays in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same place.</v>

96
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.593
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a word to now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a trickier thing because a word </v>

97
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 2>in compass campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are the same and things that</v>

98
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 2>are different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

99
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.973
<v Speaker 2>It has to because everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to categorize as an entity isn't </v>

100
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 2>homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not homogenous.</v>

101
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>It's its internal structure varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

102
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And that means that in so far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>treating it as if it's only one entity,</v>

103
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>it might do things that will surprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

104
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's especially true with complex </v>

105
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

106
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 2>well this is my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

107
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.474
<v Speaker 2>And that there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain set of assumptions </v>

108
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:19.091
<v Speaker 2>that go along with that label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but and as long as those assumptions are</v>

109
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.294
<v Speaker 2>met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that as long as </v>

110
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.784
<v Speaker 2>the relationship you have with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person stays within that definitional </v>

111
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.804
<v Speaker 2>box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can use the term and you can </v>

112
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>get somewhere with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because people are full of snakes,</v>

113
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you never know when they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump out of the category that you've put</v>

114
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.354
<v Speaker 2>them in and manifest something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unlike the word that you've </v>

115
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.334
<v Speaker 2>been using to describe them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many things are full of snakes or </v>

116
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.264
<v Speaker 2>you could say to some degree everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>is full of snakes and that's why it's </v>

117
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:52.691
<v Speaker 2>useful to think of a word as a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where multiple things move through.</v>

118
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.063
<v Speaker 2>So another example that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is say a stock because the stock </v>

119
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>market's kind of a good model of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment as such.</v>

120
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stark is like a thing.</v>

121
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So you can think of it like a thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do think of it like a thing.</v>

122
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.383
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is is that the stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is absolutely dynamic entity and </v>

123
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.173
<v Speaker 2>what it contains at any given moment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>far beyond your capacity to comprehend </v>

124
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.393
<v Speaker 2>because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about how a company is </v>

125
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 2>operating in the economic and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological environment,</v>

126
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's subject to any number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>

127
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:32.984
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know maybe it's a coffee company </v>

128
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:35.984
<v Speaker 2>stock and then there's some weird blight</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one of the coffee growing countries </v>

129
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:39.884
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe because people have been using </v>

130
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:42.674
<v Speaker 2>water improperly and so then the coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>dies and their crops bad and then the </v>

131
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:47.650
<v Speaker 2>price goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that,</v>

132
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.623
<v Speaker 2>that the stock as an entity in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense contains the whole world and you </v>

133
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 2>can treat it like it's one thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain operations,</v>

134
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time that's really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to trip you up.</v>

135
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 2>It's going to trip you up in a serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

136
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.233
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

137
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

138
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had one more.</v>

139
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that'll do for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three different.</v>

140
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.230
<v Speaker 2>So I mentioned three different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts and there is another one but I,</v>

141
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't bring it to mind at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

142
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's another way of looking at it.</v>

143
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.353
<v Speaker 2>The world is extraordinarily complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's insanely ridiculously complex </v>

144
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 2>and part of the complexity is the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

145
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.773
<v Speaker 2>and this is a hard thing to grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it sort of self evident once </v>

146
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:36.204
<v Speaker 2>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that you see exists at </v>

147
00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:40.290
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously,</v>

148
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.543
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is sort of like the train </v>

149
00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 2>metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

150
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.120
<v Speaker 2>for you to be you for a person to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

151
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Speaker 2>there's an incredible number of micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that make up that person that</v>

152
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:57.351
<v Speaker 2>has to be functioning in no </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable manner whatsoever.</v>

153
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it exists at a,</v>

154
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.983
<v Speaker 2>at a quantum level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're not going to talk about that </v>

155
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>because there isn't anything to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

156
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 2>That's intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You exist at an atomic level,</v>

157
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:09.924
<v Speaker 2>at the molecular level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the molecules make organs and </v>

158
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:13.824
<v Speaker 2>then the organs interact to make you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your nested in a family and then </v>

159
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.334
<v Speaker 2>that family is nested in the city and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city's nested in estate and the </v>

160
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.424
<v Speaker 2>state is nested in an economy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy is nested in a biosphere and </v>

161
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 2>every single one of those levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

162
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that it's relevant to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually that it is you.</v>

163
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.603
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only figure that out when something </v>

164
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong because as long as things </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going wrong,</v>

165
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 2>they're invisible and now that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing to realize.</v>

166
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:44.991
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>determining factors with regards to your</v>

167
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 2>capacity to regulate your own emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including anger and fear,</v>

168
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.113
<v Speaker 2>disgust and a variety of other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about is the fact that a </v>

169
00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:58.584
<v Speaker 2>million invisible things are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what they're supposed to be </v>

170
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 2>doing all the time.</v>

171
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.983
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that at any </v>

172
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 2>time any of those things can go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that's uh,</v>

173
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of finite mortality in a sense,</v>

174
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.323
<v Speaker 2>know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the sort of being that can be </v>

175
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:18.174
<v Speaker 2>plagued by unexpected events at multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of analysis and it's by no means </v>

176
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>obvious which of those levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis is most real.</v>

177
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.773
<v Speaker 2>I think they're all equally real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also no small feat to pick the </v>

178
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:32.124
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis at which you should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching a given problem that people </v>

179
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.680
<v Speaker 2>argue about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

180
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:38.514
<v Speaker 2>when they might say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the greatest problem facing </v>

181
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:41.994
<v Speaker 2>humanity today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like even conceptualizing where </v>

182
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:45.684
<v Speaker 2>the problem is in that entire tree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being is something that you can argue </v>

183
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 2>about for forever and not get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

184
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.843
<v Speaker 2>so part of what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want to point out to you by all </v>

185
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:57.684
<v Speaker 2>these examples is that a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are doing in their </v>

186
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:01.584
<v Speaker 2>perceptual and cognitive operations is </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraining the complexity of life to </v>

187
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Speaker 2>limits that enabled them to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also within limits that enabled them</v>

188
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>to bear staying in lie alive.</v>

189
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.253
<v Speaker 2>Both of those at the same time because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to keep existing obviously and </v>

190
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.113
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to propagate and but also </v>

191
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:24.324
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically want to do both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things while not suffering yourself </v>

192
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:31.761
<v Speaker 2>absolutely to death and so that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>set of constraints and it's necessary to</v>

193
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:34.494
<v Speaker 2>know how much of the world his invisible</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you because unless you have some </v>

194
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how much of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>his invisible,</v>

195
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you can't understand how many things </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be going wrong when something goes</v>

196
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here's,</v>

197
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a a hint.</v>

198
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.444
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something interferes with the </v>

199
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.234
<v Speaker 2>integrity of your categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the snakes that are inside those </v>

200
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.344
<v Speaker 2>categories come out and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with all those snakes and that's a </v>

201
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.544
<v Speaker 2>big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't like having your </v>

202
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 2>categorical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adequacy of your categorical systems</v>

203
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 2>challenged in any way and it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>

204
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.573
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly relevant with regards to </v>

205
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.384
<v Speaker 2>social conflict between different ethnic</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups or between groups that have been </v>

206
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.164
<v Speaker 2>historically isolated from one another </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree because the groups come </v>

207
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:24.394
<v Speaker 2>at the world with different conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures and they're not necessarily </v>

208
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:27.400
<v Speaker 2>isomorphic.</v>

209
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.233
<v Speaker 2>Some of the more fundamental assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 2>might not be the same from one place to </v>

210
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.474
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means the validity of the </v>

211
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>categories that both of those groups use</v>
<v Speaker 2>to organize their existence in the world</v>

212
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 2>come under assault when they meet.</v>

213
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

214
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.183
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why do people engage in conflict </v>

215
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:47.674
<v Speaker 2>all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason is is because </v>

216
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.594
<v Speaker 2>there is conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you believe one thing and I </v>

217
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:51.874
<v Speaker 2>believe another and we happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy the same territory and those </v>

218
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 2>beliefs have implications for how we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to behave.</v>

219
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to be conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be conflict.</v>

220
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.264
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very limited number of ways </v>

221
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>that that conflict can be resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I can become a tyrant or you can,</v>

222
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 2>which one of us is a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of us is a slave,</v>

223
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.343
<v Speaker 2>and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the logical end point to that is one of </v>

224
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.554
<v Speaker 2>us is alive and one of us is dead and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other possibility is that we can </v>

225
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.993
<v Speaker 2>negotiate and see if we can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to cohabitate in this territory </v>

226
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 2>behaviorally and conceptually </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously for a long time.</v>

227
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.013
<v Speaker 2>But that's extraordinarily difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it means you have to take your </v>

228
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:31.924
<v Speaker 2>concepts apart where they conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to figure out how to put </v>

229
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 2>them back together in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually works.</v>

230
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

231
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you should be tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

232
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:41.704
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better be tolerant because you'll </v>

233
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 2>never get along with anybody if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

234
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.033
<v Speaker 2>But you should be tolerant is no answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this question because the question </v>

235
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:49.841
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

236
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>how tolerant should you be an under what</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions?</v>

237
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be too tolerant.</v>

238
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.813
<v Speaker 2>That's easy.</v>

239
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

240
00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:05.484
<v Speaker 2>I gave you an example last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one that I really like </v>

241
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 2>because you're in a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and they betray you.</v>

242
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Your category is not adequate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now which category?</v>

243
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.351
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

244
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:17.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

245
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 2>The answer is you don't know which </v>
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>

246
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't know where the error </v>

247
00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:24.634
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously there is an error of </v>

248
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:26.664
<v Speaker 2>assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at what level and with what </v>

249
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.603
<v Speaker 2>category?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is is that an anomaly of </v>

250
00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:33.114
<v Speaker 2>any seriousness calls the validity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conceptual system as such into </v>

251
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 2>question at some unspecified double </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

252
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.110
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem because what it</v>

253
00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:46.944
<v Speaker 2>means is that it's very difficult not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>react catastrophic Lee to anything </v>

254
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:53.984
<v Speaker 2>that's unexpected because the unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing could have virtually instantly </v>

255
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now usually it doesn't,</v>

256
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but what good is usually usually it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that helpful.</v>

257
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>

258
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.313
<v Speaker 2>So the world is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex place and it's doing </v>

259
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.104
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable things and it's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable things at multiple levels </v>

260
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.164
<v Speaker 2>of analysis simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your problem is how do you act in </v>

261
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:19.304
<v Speaker 2>that environment and how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>constrain it conceptually so that it </v>

262
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:22.184
<v Speaker 2>doesn't kill you or overwhelm you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't cost you a physiological or </v>

263
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 2>psychological damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem.</v>

264
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

265
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.823
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a reflection of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't have to learn to be </v>

266
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:33.824
<v Speaker 2>afraid or on guard you start that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the world is an incredibly </v>

267
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 2>complicated and unpredictable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous place.</v>

268
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And then with a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort,</v>

269
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.753
<v Speaker 2>both individually on socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can construct up environments that </v>

270
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 2>are physical and conceptual within which</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have some degree of safety,</v>

271
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>security and the hope of some progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>during your life.</v>

272
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to dispense completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that secure,</v>

273
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>stable and promising is the normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition of a human environment.</v>

274
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.663
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to keep an environment like that </v>

275
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>requires a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective effort and individual effort.</v>

276
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 2>So we're reversing the propositions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>

277
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.293
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the underlying reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An order emerges from that with </v>

278
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.104
<v Speaker 2>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's also maintained with </v>

279
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 2>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

280
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I can give you one example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

281
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.624
<v Speaker 2>to keep a military helicopter in the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it just doesn't plummet to the </v>

282
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the piece of metal,</v>

283
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:33.854
<v Speaker 2>it actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>requires something like 35 hours of </v>

284
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.454
<v Speaker 2>maintenance for one hour of flight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that is that thing is </v>

285
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:41.264
<v Speaker 2>barely a helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just holding together by </v>

286
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:44.684
<v Speaker 2>nothing and then you have to work like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad dog to stop that thing from falling </v>

287
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>prey to instantaneous entropy and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not functioning.</v>

288
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.280
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of our elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization are like that,</v>

289
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in place so to speak,</v>

290
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 2>but to keep them doing what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

291
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:00.734
<v Speaker 2>which basically means to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the category that we placed them </v>

292
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

293
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.993
<v Speaker 2>It takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a tremendous amount and almost </v>

294
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:07.574
<v Speaker 2>incalculable amount of continued input </v>
<v Speaker 2>of energy and time and while it's </v>

295
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 2>counter in tropic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it right.</v>

296
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And things have to be stable at multiple</v>

297
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:17.654
<v Speaker 2>levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of differentiation for anything complex </v>

298
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>to maintain itself for any length of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

299
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's by no means entropies the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard,</v>

300
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 2>the standard reality complex things </v>
<v Speaker 2>decay towards their simpler forms.</v>

301
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.383
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule of existence and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex forms and so we're </v>

302
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.763
<v Speaker 2>chronically trying to stop entropy from </v>
<v Speaker 2>tearing us into our constituent </v>

303
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

304
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 2>now some of you have seen this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to show it again.</v>

305
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you haven't seen precisely this </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of it,</v>

306
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 2>but this line of research wasn't piloted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Dan Simon,</v>

307
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>although he's done a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>to popularize it.</v>

308
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.143
<v Speaker 2>His demonstrations have become some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most famous demonstrations that </v>

309
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:04.701
<v Speaker 2>psychologists have ever put together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular line of investigation,</v>

310
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.933
<v Speaker 2>although it might be old hat to you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps was an absolute staggering </v>

311
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:15.651
<v Speaker 2>shocked everyone when it was first </v>
<v Speaker 2>revealed because the hypothesis was that</v>

312
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 2>first of all that we see the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well.</v>

313
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

314
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:20.274
<v Speaker 2>and when we look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing it in a relatively </v>

315
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive manner and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's wrong.</v>

316
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And then the second hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

317
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.213
<v Speaker 2>which was a deeper hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even if we don't see the world </v>

318
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:33.354
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something that's unexpected </v>

319
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 2>conceptually happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will.</v>

320
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Our attention will be automatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn to it.</v>

321
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 2>And that also turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to look at this video and</v>

322
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.953
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

323
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>so the rule is here because he probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't be to hear the sound,</v>

324
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.713
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see two teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one white and one black and the teams </v>

325
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.430
<v Speaker 2>are going to move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a basketball,</v>

326
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 2>each of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to move around,</v>

327
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:02.394
<v Speaker 2>they gonna throw the basketball back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth to the other members of their </v>

328
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:05.874
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the white dress people in the black </v>

329
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:08.754
<v Speaker 2>dress people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your job is to count how many times </v>

330
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 2>the basket ball is thrown back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully.</v>

331
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to be looking out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white dress,</v>

332
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>the players dressed in white and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just count the basketballs.</v>

333
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.690
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

334
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>don't spoil it for those who haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you may not have seen this variation</v>

335
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.670
<v Speaker 2>in any case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

336
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:42.364
<v Speaker 2>So there's the grill of one person </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves and then the curtain changes </v>

337
00:20:46.451 --> 00:20:47.284
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

338
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

339
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's brilliant,</v>

340
00:20:57.731 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 2>it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

341
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

342
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 2>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

343
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.183
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

344
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 2>when you look at that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

345
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.833
<v Speaker 2>If I'm concentrating on one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of other things I'm </v>

346
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:10.884
<v Speaker 2>missing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those might be unbelievably </v>

347
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 2>massive and then it's even worse as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon just demonstrated,</v>

348
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:18.274
<v Speaker 2>which is if I'm concentrating on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and I'm paying attention for the </v>

349
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 2>possibility that something strange might</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

350
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 2>well I'm watching for the strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other strange things that I don't expect</v>

351
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:31.210
<v Speaker 2>will happen and I won't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

352
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:32.044
<v Speaker 2>so I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that demonstration because it's </v>

353
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:35.764
<v Speaker 2>such a concrete presentation of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're dealing with something </v>

354
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:44.770
<v Speaker 2>complex with relatively limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

355
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:45.604
<v Speaker 2>Now it's kind of obvious if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because there's you and then </v>

356
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:49.594
<v Speaker 2>there's the entire rest of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the reality that's within you </v>

357
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:54.180
<v Speaker 2>that you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

358
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.103
<v Speaker 2>It's still something completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different to have that pushed in your </v>

359
00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 2>face like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

360
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned before,</v>

361
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.673
<v Speaker 2>one of the propositions basically up </v>
<v Speaker 2>until the time this line of research </v>

362
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that you operate in the world with a</v>

363
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.054
<v Speaker 2>certain set of assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the world and you interact with </v>

364
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:12.934
<v Speaker 2>it and the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting and that you see are real </v>

365
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.470
<v Speaker 2>and it's relatively straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter to perceive them because they're,</v>

366
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.313
<v Speaker 2>they are like things and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with them in a manner that </v>

367
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 2>produces a predictable outcome and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>something radical happens,</v>

368
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.514
<v Speaker 2>you will automatically attend to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the proposition of </v>

369
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:34.354
<v Speaker 2>psychological theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological theory for a very </v>

370
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:37.384
<v Speaker 2>long period of time and it had a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence on fields like artificial </v>

371
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:41.104
<v Speaker 2>intelligence before they discovered that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was virtually impossible to perceive </v>

372
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:45.034
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so complex that we can't really </v>

373
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 2>figure out how we do it.</v>

374
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:49.264
<v Speaker 2>in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous strides have been made in </v>

376
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 2>having machines that can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate in the real world,</v>

377
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 2>which is something new and absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable and amazing.</v>

378
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

379
00:22:59.521 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 2>what the bottom line for this turned out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be that.</v>

380
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

381
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the world.</v>

382
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.430
<v Speaker 2>You see a subset of the world and which </v>
<v Speaker 2>subset you see depends on your intent.</v>

383
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.511
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

384
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:14.980
<v Speaker 2>that's obvious from this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

385
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:15.814
<v Speaker 2>Because your intent when you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>the video is to count the number of </v>

386
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:18.874
<v Speaker 2>balls that are being passed back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth and that attend intent occurred </v>

387
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.953
<v Speaker 2>merely because I asked you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that that </v>

388
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 2>indicates is how easy it is for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift what your goal is.</v>

389
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:30.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when human beings are unbelievably good </v>

390
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for most animals,</v>

391
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.733
<v Speaker 2>goals are driven in some sense by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>operation of underlying fundamental </v>

392
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:40.840
<v Speaker 2>biological systems.</v>

393
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.913
<v Speaker 2>They're not just goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole schemes of perception and </v>

394
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:45.514
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like little subpersonalities I </v>

395
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 2>would say in that they're embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual,</v>

396
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:55.061
<v Speaker 2>cognitive and emotional solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>classic biological problems.</v>

397
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.683
<v Speaker 2>So they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an animal's head is full of </v>

398
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 2>little robots and it's not like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven by a motivational system.</v>

399
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:04.723
<v Speaker 2>The motivational system is a sub element</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the animal that participates in the </v>

400
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 2>entire animal's being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if an animal is hungry,</v>

401
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.333
<v Speaker 2>then it sees the things that hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals sea and it responds emotionally </v>

402
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:20.600
<v Speaker 2>to the cues that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>food or it's absence.</v>

403
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 2>And it thinks in so far as an animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks and strategizes.</v>

404
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hunters in particular,</v>

405
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.673
<v Speaker 2>the pack hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it strategizes from within that </v>

406
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:30.824
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't think about it as a </v>

407
00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:33.294
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about it as an entire </v>

408
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>way of looking at the world and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of have to think of the animal as a</v>

409
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:38.774
<v Speaker 2>collection of different ways of looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world in accordance with the </v>

410
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>different problems that the animal has.</v>

411
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.473
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except as your cortex grew radically </v>

412
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 2>over the last several million years you </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwent,</v>

413
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:53.144
<v Speaker 2>this seems weird transformation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're timespan God extremely broad and </v>

414
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.064
<v Speaker 2>your capacity for abstraction increased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the consequences of that was </v>

415
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:02.564
<v Speaker 2>that you learned how to replace what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might regard as purely biologically </v>

416
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 2>determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively immediate goals.</v>

417
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.053
<v Speaker 2>Although they're really personalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>with unbelievably abstract goals that </v>

418
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.263
<v Speaker 2>could be manifested in a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and that might work over </v>

419
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 2>very long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different thing.</v>

420
00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 2>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the upshot of that is,</v>

421
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:26.534
<v Speaker 2>is you can pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a system that's that that </v>

422
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.313
<v Speaker 2>allows you to formulate virtually any </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame of reference imaginable and then </v>

423
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:35.984
<v Speaker 2>to look through the world and act on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world in accordance with that frame of </v>

424
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 2>reference so that I can just say to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>your task now,</v>

425
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:43.304
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be something you value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your task is to turn yourself into a </v>

426
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:51.581
<v Speaker 2>personality for whom counting the basket</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball throws for the next five minutes is</v>

427
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the PR is your primary aim in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that.</v>

428
00:25:58.231 --> 00:25:59.064
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You reconfigure your entire perceptual </v>

429
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 2>system so that you you feel inadequate </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree.</v>

430
00:26:04.231 --> 00:26:07.050
<v Speaker 2>If you can't perform the task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're motivated to do it.</v>

431
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.600
<v Speaker 2>You focus your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're pleased.</v>

432
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.434
<v Speaker 2>If you can track the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pleased if you get the right </v>

433
00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:16.680
<v Speaker 2>answer and you do that at the drop of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hat.</v>

434
00:26:16.681 --> 00:26:17.514
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the consequences of </v>

435
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:23.220
<v Speaker 2>human cognitive transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now</v>

436
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.820
<v Speaker 2>what that also means is that from moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>to moment as a consequence of the varied</v>

437
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.253
<v Speaker 2>goals that you're pursuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also make a determination of what </v>

438
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to attend to and what you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore.</v>

439
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.193
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should you attend to and what can </v>

440
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:55.911
<v Speaker 2>you ignore is you should attend to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal number of entities necessary for</v>

441
00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you to produce the outcome that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire.</v>

442
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

443
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 2>if you read classic cybernetic accounts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of motivation,</v>

444
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.803
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the behavioral theories </v>

445
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 2>of motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mostly drive motivations.</v>

446
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's a deterministic element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

447
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 2>You're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a state of deprivation,</v>

448
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.423
<v Speaker 2>and as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driven down a certain behavioral </v>

449
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

450
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:24.144
<v Speaker 2>So that's the behavioral idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's some truth in that because </v>

451
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:31.461
<v Speaker 2>some of your biological subsystems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and ancient enough,</v>

452
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 2>so they do kind of operate as chained </v>
<v Speaker 2>deterministic systems.</v>

453
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you act in,</v>

454
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.753
<v Speaker 2>in any complex way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually set up a system of chained </v>

455
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 2>deterministic events so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement the action.</v>

456
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So I can show you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

457
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.650
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you're watching,</v>

458
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 2>what my arm does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

459
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:55.560
<v Speaker 2>so you see that I accelerated it very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

460
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And then just before he hit the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped it.</v>

461
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.393
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that I can move my hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fast that a new signal from my brain </v>

462
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 2>can't get to my hand during the time I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going like this,</v>

463
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.153
<v Speaker 2>and so what that means is that I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>set that entire system of operations up </v>

464
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:17.061
<v Speaker 2>as a ballistic movement and then release</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you're doing that all the time.</v>

465
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 2>When you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with the world,</v>

466
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:20.034
<v Speaker 2>you have systems that are automated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that run into deterministic manner and </v>

467
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:25.194
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing in part when you act </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the world is you're disinhibiting </v>

468
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:29.340
<v Speaker 2>them one after the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you do that.</v>

469
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:30.570
<v Speaker 2>When you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

470
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.673
<v Speaker 2>where do you look when you're driving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't look right in front of the </v>

471
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:36.220
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

472
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.040
<v Speaker 2>That's because you're going to run over </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's there.</v>

473
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What good is looking there?</v>

474
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.260
<v Speaker 2>If it's something's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run over it.</v>

475
00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:46.094
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't a thing you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you do is you look far enough </v>

476
00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:48.524
<v Speaker 2>down the road so that you can sequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>automated actions as a consequence of </v>

477
00:28:52.761 --> 00:28:55.580
<v Speaker 2>your perception and then they run in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>

478
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.820
<v Speaker 2>they run ballistically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't control them once they've,</v>

479
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.370
<v Speaker 2>once they've been implemented and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that all the time,</v>

480
00:29:01.371 --> 00:29:02.204
<v Speaker 2>like you're wandering around on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform of semi automated systems and </v>

481
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.853
<v Speaker 2>your choice in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the choice of which of those semi </v>

482
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.290
<v Speaker 2>automated systems you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement at any given time.</v>

483
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you throw up a frame of reference.</v>

484
00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk more about them in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

485
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.760
<v Speaker 2>He throw up a frame of reference and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you attend to anything that gets in</v>

486
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:23.594
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

487
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.750
<v Speaker 2>If it interferes with the desired </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome,</v>

488
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.590
<v Speaker 2>so that's not the same as merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to anything unexpected.</v>

489
00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:31.940
<v Speaker 2>As you can see what the grill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

490
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Speaker 2>if that gorilla would have jumped in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of one of the players in white and</v>

491
00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:37.214
<v Speaker 2>grabbed the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a high probability that you </v>

492
00:29:39.501 --> 00:29:40.334
<v Speaker 2>would have seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it would have onto it for </v>

493
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:42.544
<v Speaker 2>some length of time because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened there was that the anomalous </v>

494
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:46.594
<v Speaker 2>event turned out to be a relevant factor</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your pursuit of the goal that you </v>

495
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:56.881
<v Speaker 2>deemed appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say that you respond</v>

496
00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.460
<v Speaker 2>to the world as if it's a predictable </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

497
00:30:01.461 --> 00:30:02.294
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's doing what you want it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and then you respond to the world </v>

498
00:30:05.421 --> 00:30:10.421
<v Speaker 2>as an unpredictable place when anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens that stops you from reaching the</v>

499
00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:14.420
<v Speaker 2>goal that you've determined to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant at this point in time.</v>

500
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.583
<v Speaker 2>And so those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense you're two modes of </v>

501
00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:17.564
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you could also add that if you're </v>

502
00:30:19.011 --> 00:30:22.820
<v Speaker 2>pursuing a goal or embodying a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal directed personality,</v>

503
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.923
<v Speaker 2>then things that facilitate movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards that goal are going to be </v>

504
00:30:26.181 --> 00:30:27.014
<v Speaker 2>positive and things that interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement towards that goal are going to </v>

505
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 2>be negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you understand that,</v>

506
00:30:32.421 --> 00:30:35.420
<v Speaker 2>then you've got some sense of how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental emotional systems work.</v>

507
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.490
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

508
00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:38.324
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

509
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.123
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this little diagram is designed to </v>

510
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.124
<v Speaker 2>show you what the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception and and actuality might be </v>

511
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 2>and even what the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception and a word might be.</v>

512
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:03.064
<v Speaker 2>So the theory behind this little diagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a set of phenomena in </v>

513
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 2>front of you that's too complex to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

514
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:10.414
<v Speaker 2>And so what you do is you generate a low</v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution representations of it and </v>

515
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that low resolution representations is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what you see.</v>

516
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not a concept or you could say it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a percept,</v>

517
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>it's what you see when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

518
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.853
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what you do with your words as </v>

519
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you labeled the percept of the thing.</v>

520
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:29.883
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

521
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like a double</v>

522
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.490
<v Speaker 2>compression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in some sense what you're doing.</v>

523
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.210
<v Speaker 2>So you have a complex reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you perceive it in a,</v>

524
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.970
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a low resolution form,</v>

525
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>and then you labeled the perception and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives you a word.</v>

526
00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're doing basically is </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the world that you can understand</v>

527
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.553
<v Speaker 2>and you're make putting it in smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>and smaller and tighter boxes until you </v>

528
00:31:51.901 --> 00:31:52.734
<v Speaker 2>have a box that's small enough and tight</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so that you can actually </v>

529
00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:56.124
<v Speaker 2>manipulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a fine plan except when it </v>

530
00:31:57.991 --> 00:32:00.060
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>

531
00:32:00.061 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when it doesn't work?</v>

532
00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And that is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

533
00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:05.310
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the top left hand corner,</v>

534
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.353
<v Speaker 2>I call that the thing in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a phrase from Sarah translated </v>

535
00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:13.800
<v Speaker 2>phrase from German philosophy in the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea was that well you never really have</v>

536
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:14.634
<v Speaker 2>contact with the thing in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you're not capable of </v>

537
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 2>perceiving it or comprehending it.</v>

538
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.840
<v Speaker 2>So what you see are elements of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to say,</v>

539
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:26.100
<v Speaker 2>well that's the thing in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a schematic representation of it.</v>

540
00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:29.430
<v Speaker 2>It's quite complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then hypothetically you can see that</v>

541
00:32:29.431 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Speaker 2>thing in all the other ways that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrated in the diagram.</v>

542
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I asked you what that was,</v>

543
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.013
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's a rectangle or you could say </v>

544
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a with four rectangles as sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>

545
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what,</v>

546
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 2>24 rows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it also is.</v>

547
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:47.894
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say it's a bounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>rectangle that's made out of two paths </v>

548
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 2>and for sub rectangles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say that it's.</v>

549
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.153
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how many are in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know that's the most </v>

550
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 2>differentiated representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Object Five.</v>

551
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:03.261
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

552
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 2>which of those is the real object?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer first would be,</v>

553
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.053
<v Speaker 2>well none of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second answer would be it </v>

554
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:14.000
<v Speaker 2>depends on what you want to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations and you actually,</v>

555
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not really obvious that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make things more real than that.</v>

556
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.483
<v Speaker 2>It's like how real is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving it's real enough for certain </v>

557
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 2>operations and not real enough for </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

558
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.653
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

559
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.913
<v Speaker 2>it's validity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pragmatic approach is it's a </v>

560
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.153
<v Speaker 2>validity is determined by its </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicability in the situation in which </v>

561
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to apply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

562
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.813
<v Speaker 2>And then at the bottom there are words </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the words are basically labels for </v>

563
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:43.300
<v Speaker 2>those percept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

564
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first one you could sum up as </v>
<v Speaker 2>432 because I guess there's 432 little </v>

565
00:33:48.481 --> 00:33:49.314
<v Speaker 2>circles there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second one you could on the </v>

566
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:53.064
<v Speaker 2>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could summarize as across or a </v>

567
00:33:53.851 --> 00:33:54.684
<v Speaker 2>rectangle and the one at the top you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could summarize as a flag and you get </v>

568
00:33:59.281 --> 00:34:00.114
<v Speaker 2>the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the word is representing a percept </v>

569
00:34:01.921 --> 00:34:04.140
<v Speaker 2>that's already simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's representing something that's</v>

570
00:34:04.141 --> 00:34:06.510
<v Speaker 2>more complex underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

571
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.660
<v Speaker 2>so here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're looking at a computer,</v>

572
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.300
<v Speaker 2>your computer crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say,</v>

573
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.270
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

574
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.103
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

575
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 2>you're working on your computer and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

576
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:34.700
<v Speaker 2>well are you actually working on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer?</v>

577
00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And the question that they answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

578
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:37.663
<v Speaker 2>it depends on exactly what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer and exactly what is this thing </v>

579
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:41.684
<v Speaker 2>that's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually when you're working on a </v>

580
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:44.204
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you generally see is only the </v>

581
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 2>screen and you don't even see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

582
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.733
<v Speaker 2>You see that tiny sub element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen that contains those </v>

583
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:52.544
<v Speaker 2>representational entities that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly relevant to the area of the </v>

584
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:58.730
<v Speaker 2>world that you're focusing on right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want something to happen.</v>

585
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.043
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really when you're interacting with </v>

586
00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:02.004
<v Speaker 2>the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just interacting with this tiny </v>

587
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:04.664
<v Speaker 2>little part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the problem is in order for </v>

588
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:12.161
<v Speaker 2>that tiny little part to maintain its </v>
<v Speaker 2>validity as a representational entity,</v>

589
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 2>all the things that you don't see about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the computer,</v>

590
00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>half the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

591
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

592
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:18.734
<v Speaker 2>what don't you see about the computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what this diagram is </v>

593
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:23.204
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be showing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing is you don't see the </v>

594
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 2>elemental properties of the computer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be its existence at a quantum</v>

595
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:29.504
<v Speaker 2>level and that actually turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly irrelevant for computer </v>

596
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:33.614
<v Speaker 2>designers because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot specify the location and the </v>

597
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 2>momentum of a particle at a quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>level with 100 percent accuracy.</v>

598
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is it actually has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually has relevance.</v>

599
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.803
<v Speaker 2>The little wires in computer chips are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting so small now that there's some </v>

600
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 2>reasonable probability that an electron </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think will be in the wire is outside</v>

601
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means they'll short out.</v>

602
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So at some level of interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quantum properties actually matter.</v>

603
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the computer you don't</v>

604
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

605
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.013
<v Speaker 2>And then while the computer itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of all these little parts that </v>

606
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:10.704
<v Speaker 2>are as complex as little cities and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just packed with that and you what you </v>

607
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:14.394
<v Speaker 2>don't know about that could fill hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>volumes in any of those things can you </v>

608
00:36:17.471 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>malfunctioned in any moment.</v>

609
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:20.004
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those micro parts are arranged </v>

610
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:23.004
<v Speaker 2>into subcomponents with a desktop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're a sound card is gone or </v>

611
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 2>your video card is gone or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could take out and replace.</v>

612
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:33.620
<v Speaker 2>If you could only specify the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis or you know,</v>

613
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe you bought a lousy brand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem he bought.</v>

614
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Bought some cheap computer that's made </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a digital factory.</v>

615
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 2>And the probability that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable as zero.</v>

616
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:42.744
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why is it that that brand is not </v>

617
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 2>reliable?</v>

618
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

619
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 2>the economic system within which it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced is corrupt.</v>

620
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 2>And so as the political system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as a consequence of that,</v>

621
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 2>people can get away with shawty </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing.</v>

622
00:36:56.011 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 2>And that manifests itself as the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your computer crashes in the middle</v>

623
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 2>of an essay and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

624
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 2>what's the right level of resolution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve that problem?</v>

625
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not obvious.</v>

626
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.743
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you mean by solvent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now usually what you mean is do the </v>

627
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:13.944
<v Speaker 2>minimum necessary to get the system back</v>
<v Speaker 2>online so that you can return to your </v>

628
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's by no means obvious that that's</v>

629
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:23.484
<v Speaker 2>always the right solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it isn't because at some </v>

630
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:26.244
<v Speaker 2>point you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I should just throw the computer </v>

631
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

632
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:31.134
<v Speaker 2>if you own computers that when to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>them away is actually a complicated </v>

633
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:35.070
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

634
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have like three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>old laptops lying around the house?</v>

635
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

636
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

637
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still work well do they really?</v>

638
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And then a deeper question is what makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that they're still laptops?</v>

639
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.913
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they look like laptops and that's </v>

640
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 2>also wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like laptops.</v>

641
00:37:56.551 --> 00:38:01.551
<v Speaker 2>If you think that a box is a laptop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not and it with computers,</v>

642
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:02.424
<v Speaker 2>you can really see this way because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have an entity that's fully </v>

643
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a laptop,</v>

644
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.823
<v Speaker 2>and then if you just leave it on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk and don't touch it for five years </v>

645
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 2>or let's say 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it then?</v>

646
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become so disconnected from the </v>

647
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:19.014
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem that it's a part of that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might not be useful for anything </v>

648
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:23.244
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not even be able to get it to </v>

649
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:25.164
<v Speaker 2>work and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most things around us don't change that </v>

650
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.254
<v Speaker 2>fast so we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can perceive them in relatively </v>

651
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:32.274
<v Speaker 2>simple forms and they don't transform so</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick that that shows us that our </v>

652
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 2>perception is going to stray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but computers aren't like that.</v>

653
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:39.993
<v Speaker 2>They transformed so rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably spend one fifth of your </v>

654
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 2>time just trying to just trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with the transformations.</v>

655
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.823
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that is to be used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the anticipation in a person that it </v>

656
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 4>could be used as a laptop if they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make it?</v>

657
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.721
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

658
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 2>it does to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is do you actually use it?</v>

659
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.023
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that's actually the manner in </v>

660
00:39:07.331 --> 00:39:08.164
<v Speaker 2>which you test the validity of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual theory because I would say </v>

661
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:13.810
<v Speaker 2>that a laptop that you don't use is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually not a laptop.</v>

662
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hypothetical laptop now </v>
<v Speaker 2>began to see.</v>

663
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm being picky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picky about these sorts of things,</v>

664
00:39:20.321 --> 00:39:21.154
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing that because we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand exactly how categories </v>

665
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 2>work and it is not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious at all.</v>

666
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.323
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is is that the laptop </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually transforms into a brick </v>

667
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.733
<v Speaker 2>relatively slowly and deciding when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a laptop and went into brick is not </v>

668
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>obvious because it doesn't denounce </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

669
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't stop working all of a </v>

670
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:42.214
<v Speaker 2>sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just works in a manner that's </v>

671
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:45.694
<v Speaker 2>completely counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's quite </v>

672
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.414
<v Speaker 2>interesting is there's not a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that the electronic revolution </v>

673
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:53.254
<v Speaker 2>has increased productivity and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that is how much time </v>

674
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.494
<v Speaker 2>during the week do you suppose you spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keeping your computer updated and </v>

675
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 2>making sure that you understand how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

676
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Like would that be 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that you used the computer?</v>

677
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that unreasonable estimate?</v>

678
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:12.904
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think for me it's like 20 </v>

679
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:19.720
<v Speaker 2>percent of my time it's horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have quite a few computers and</v>

680
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always doing weird things of one</v>

681
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.594
<v Speaker 2>form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when I just leave the b they'll </v>

682
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>update and then they will work or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

683
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.363
<v Speaker 2>I have a new computer and it's got such </v>
<v Speaker 2>a high resolution screen that you can't </v>

684
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 2>use photoshop on it because he can't see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the menu items anymore.</v>

685
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 2>And Adobe is known about that for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole year.</v>

686
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:36.604
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like there's all these weird </v>

687
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:39.154
<v Speaker 2>little snakes popping up all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place with something as complex as your </v>

688
00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:42.514
<v Speaker 2>computer and battling them off I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroys all the potential productivity </v>

689
00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 2>that the tool was actually designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>

690
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if that's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly seems that way to me.</v>

691
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

692
00:40:54.581 --> 00:40:55.414
<v Speaker 2>So the laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny entity too because you can </v>

693
00:40:58.151 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 2>certainly see that it's connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly to a very large network.</v>

694
00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the Internet clearly,</v>

695
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.370
<v Speaker 2>but partly that's an information portal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but partly the,</v>

696
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the thing stays alive because of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to the Internet,</v>

697
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:13.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's continually updating,</v>

698
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:14.194
<v Speaker 2>it's continually being modified because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's plugged into something that's </v>

699
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 2>essentially a living system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you think about it as a laptop,</v>

700
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.633
<v Speaker 2>you're just ignoring all of that and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really can't because you can't ignore </v>

701
00:41:24.911 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 2>all that because it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's even more real than I kind of think</v>

702
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:30.840
<v Speaker 2>of these things like leaves on a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trees,</v>

703
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.600
<v Speaker 2>the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are just leaves and you know,</v>

704
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 2>they fall off and then you have to then </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're dead.</v>

705
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good indication of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our perceptions deceive us.</v>

706
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:42.914
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you might notice is </v>

707
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.033
<v Speaker 2>what kind of emotional reaction do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have when your computer ceases to be a </v>

708
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 2>laptop while you're working on something</v>
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>

709
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:58.430
<v Speaker 2>What's your response?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frustration and anger mostly.</v>

710
00:41:58.431 --> 00:41:59.264
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there'll be some anxiety in that </v>

711
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:02.120
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And probably some contempt,</v>

712
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might say,</v>

713
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stupid bloody thing,</v>

714
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an expression of contempt,</v>

715
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 2>which is associated with disgust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's the anxiety which is,</v>

716
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:13.310
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I gonna do with this now?</v>

717
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.323
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the anger and that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of something interfering </v>

718
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:17.924
<v Speaker 2>with your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directed with your goal directed </v>

719
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:20.234
<v Speaker 2>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that's really </v>

720
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile to note is to note that </v>
<v Speaker 2>panoply of emotions.</v>

721
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Now there might also be a little excited</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly because you could say,</v>

722
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.223
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I wanted to get rid of this piece </v>

723
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 2>of junk anyways and get a new computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

724
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Because so when it collapses into its </v>
<v Speaker 2>sub elements,</v>

725
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.533
<v Speaker 2>this mess of sub elements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of possibilities that </v>

726
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:42.164
<v Speaker 2>immediately arise that your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is attuned to and the way your </v>

727
00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>nervous system responds to that is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets frustrated,</v>

728
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets afraid,</v>

729
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 2>it gets disgusted and it gets curious </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what's going to happen next.</v>

730
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.670
<v Speaker 2>And all of that happens at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

731
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:56.923
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that that response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an embodied response and an </v>

732
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:00.764
<v Speaker 2>instinctive response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's cognitive elaborations </v>

733
00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:03.344
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the response you have when you </v>

734
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:06.254
<v Speaker 2>actually see the actual world or as </v>
<v Speaker 2>close as you're going to get to it </v>

735
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.064
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think that you see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world at all until the things you're </v>

736
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:16.160
<v Speaker 2>doing don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as they don't work,</v>

737
00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:21.161
<v Speaker 2>Bang you see the world now see is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird way to think about that.</v>

738
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.390
<v Speaker 2>But then we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

739
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 2>that's the closest you ever get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>having contact with the thing in itself.</v>

740
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.083
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very stressful to have contact with the </v>

741
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 2>thing in itself because God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's going to do.</v>

742
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:35.563
<v Speaker 2>So your conceptual systems protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from contact with reality in the same </v>

743
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:43.800
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things young said,</v>

744
00:43:43.801 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 2>which I think is extraordinarily funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

745
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:46.634
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of religious systems is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop people from having religious </v>

746
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:49.724
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an extraordinarily remarkable and </v>

747
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:53.624
<v Speaker 2>intelligent claim because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to have a religious </v>

748
00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 2>experience that'll carry you into bits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

749
00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:03.930
<v Speaker 5>Interesting encounter with things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not the real world when it stops.</v>

750
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.920
<v Speaker 5>Now let's take a lot of effort.</v>

751
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how we do it.</v>

752
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say say something collapses on you,</v>

753
00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:18.870
<v Speaker 2>like your car breaks down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

754
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.570
<v Speaker 2>do you actually solve that problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

755
00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 2>generally you don't write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you parse off the problem</v>

756
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:30.150
<v Speaker 2>to someone else whose knowledge about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the multilevel reality of the automobile</v>

757
00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 2>is much more and differentiated than </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>

758
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:33.893
<v Speaker 2>And so partly the way we deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity of the world is that we set </v>

759
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 2>ourselves up as a distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>supercomputer and we can,</v>

760
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.120
<v Speaker 2>we can call on elements of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>supercomputing process.</v>

761
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It says at any given time to increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>our level of resolution of the world and</v>

762
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.353
<v Speaker 2>to solve the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so partly we solve it as </v>

763
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:50.844
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a huge chunk of it is that we solve </v>

764
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:55.090
<v Speaker 2>it as a consequence of continual </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

765
00:44:55.091 --> 00:44:55.924
<v Speaker 2>And that's also becoming increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious since the rise of the Internet </v>

766
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:01.470
<v Speaker 2>because now I don't care what problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>

767
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a high probability that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere merely as a consequence of the</v>

768
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:07.284
<v Speaker 2>innate altruism of human beings has put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together an extraordinarily detailed </v>

769
00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:11.184
<v Speaker 2>video on exactly how to solve this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little micro problem that's be said to </v>

770
00:45:14.631 --> 00:45:15.464
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really a fascinating and an </v>

771
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.210
<v Speaker 2>unexamined phenomenon because I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are all familiar with that.</v>

772
00:45:22.211 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to change the stereo.</v>

773
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I have an old card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to change the stereo.</v>

774
00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:31.661
<v Speaker 2>So the search was how to replace a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereo in a 2005 Huyandai's Sonata,</v>

775
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some guy down in the US for some </v>

776
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:37.590
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>videotaped themselves doing it.</v>

777
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 2>And there it was and it's really quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool that that happens because you know,</v>

778
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.863
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sydney evolutionary psychologists and </v>

779
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 2>biologists always argue about whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is such a thing as actual altruism</v>

780
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:49.224
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard not to see someone taking the </v>

781
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:52.644
<v Speaker 2>time to post to post an observation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them undertaking a complex task for no </v>

782
00:45:57.781 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>financial reward whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard not to see that as a form of,</v>

783
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous,</v>

784
00:46:03.611 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 2>old truism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

785
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:05.980
<v Speaker 2>very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

786
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.693
<v Speaker 5>Happens with people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 5>anxious or something like little things </v>

787
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 5>abstract and it seems like the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

788
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll get.</v>

789
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.713
<v Speaker 2>We'll get to the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>your conceptual systems and how things </v>

790
00:46:23.511 --> 00:46:24.980
<v Speaker 2>fall apart here right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

791
00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:25.923
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've run you through a couple of </v>

792
00:46:26.661 --> 00:46:30.320
<v Speaker 2>examples of the complexity that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>faced with that's invisible.</v>

793
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that's really most </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth considering is that your stability</v>

794
00:46:34.641 --> 00:46:37.880
<v Speaker 2>is dependent on the maintenance of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million conditions.</v>

795
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.483
<v Speaker 2>The maintenance of a million conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could go wrong at any particular </v>

796
00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:45.260
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally don't,</v>

797
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.640
<v Speaker 2>at least not in a functioning society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

798
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:50.743
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

799
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.623
<v Speaker 2>I will look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mentioned frames of reference and </v>

800
00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:57.844
<v Speaker 2>so you cannot look at the world without </v>
<v Speaker 2>a frame of reference and the reason you </v>

801
00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:04.480
<v Speaker 2>can't do that is because it's too </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex to see.</v>

802
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So that means that a frame of reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually a pro,</v>

803
00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:11.350
<v Speaker 2>a necessity for perception itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting.</v>

804
00:47:11.351 --> 00:47:15.430
<v Speaker 2>So you cannot perceive it all unless you</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive locally and pragmatically.</v>

805
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask yourself,</v>

806
00:47:17.951 --> 00:47:19.960
<v Speaker 2>well what are these frames of reference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look like,</v>

807
00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.943
<v Speaker 2>and this is where I think neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and cognitive science meets </v>

808
00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:25.774
<v Speaker 2>narrative psychology and psychoanalysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think this just as the </v>

809
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:35.790
<v Speaker 2>smallest units of your semi robotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsystems,</v>

810
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 2>the ones you share with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our personality,</v>

811
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:39.334
<v Speaker 2>like when they manifest themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the concepts that you use to build </v>

812
00:47:44.501 --> 00:47:48.960
<v Speaker 2>the frame of reference that you orient </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with our narrative like because</v>

813
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:49.803
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

814
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.740
<v Speaker 2>what's a narrative?</v>

815
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of a personality inaction.</v>

816
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.983
<v Speaker 2>That's what a narrative is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if the actual problem solving </v>

817
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:06.601
<v Speaker 2>subcomponents of your psyche are </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities,</v>

818
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:11.761
<v Speaker 2>then the description of those is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be basic narratives.</v>

819
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.083
<v Speaker 2>And so the hypothesis here is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're tremendously imitative </v>

820
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:18.610
<v Speaker 2>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

821
00:48:18.611 --> 00:48:19.444
<v Speaker 2>I can poll your personality out of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>at any given time by just watching what </v>

822
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you do and matching it with my body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that all the time.</v>

823
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:30.901
<v Speaker 2>If you're a reasonably social person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking to someone one on one,</v>

824
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you're going to match your behavior to </v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs and all sorts of ways.</v>

825
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the experiments we did once was </v>

826
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 2>we brought undergraduates into the lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just put like a,</v>

827
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bowl of chips between them and </v>

828
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>basically what we found is that each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the undergraduates,</v>

829
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>eight exactly the same amount of chips </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the other.</v>

830
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.403
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes a dyad would settle into no</v>
<v Speaker 2>chips and so neither of them would eat </v>

831
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:54.454
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another dyad would settle </v>

832
00:48:55.721 --> 00:48:58.360
<v Speaker 2>somehow into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll eat all the chips and so then</v>

833
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 2>each of them would eat half and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation was like point nine.</v>

834
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievable and these were </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers you know.</v>

835
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And so you're mirroring the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>person's embodiment,</v>

836
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:08.883
<v Speaker 2>like a mad dog all the time and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great thing to be able to do because it </v>

837
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:13.084
<v Speaker 2>means that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can unite your being within the </v>

838
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:17.970
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the same locale.</v>

839
00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 2>And that means you don't have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

840
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.793
<v Speaker 2>Plus it also means that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly from someone else just by </v>

841
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 2>doing what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you guys have seen this,</v>

842
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:31.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's computers now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that take advantage of this idea.</v>

843
00:49:31.061 --> 00:49:33.400
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have a computer,</v>

844
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that it's a robot and you want it to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this task.</v>

845
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 2>So pick something up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move it up here,</v>

846
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.903
<v Speaker 2>pull it over here and put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you do is you take the robot's arm </v>

847
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and you put it down and you close it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you lift it up and you move it over</v>

848
00:49:48.521 --> 00:49:49.354
<v Speaker 2>and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the robot would do it by </v>

849
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:52.220
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

850
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:53.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beginnings of robotic </v>

851
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 2>imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually real.</v>

852
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Imitation is mind boggling because once </v>
<v Speaker 2>it kicks in,</v>

853
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:00.843
<v Speaker 2>as soon as one thing learned something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all the other things that are </v>

854
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:03.754
<v Speaker 2>exactly like it can learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I think will happen in the </v>

855
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.294
<v Speaker 2>next five years is we'll finally get </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots that are fairly autonomous and </v>

856
00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

857
00:50:11.321 --> 00:50:14.770
<v Speaker 2>they're really on their way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll get ones that are good at</v>

858
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 2>imitating each other and then the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>will just explode.</v>

859
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:17.883
<v Speaker 2>Because if there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>say there's say there's 10 million of </v>

860
00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:22.960
<v Speaker 2>those robots that are reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>

861
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Then as soon as one of them learns </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

862
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:29.990
<v Speaker 2>all the other ones will immediately know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and while that's not,</v>

863
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.113
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exponential growth on a scale </v>

864
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that we can't even imagine and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming very,</v>

865
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

866
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you already do that and that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason people are so damn smart.</v>

867
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:40.783
<v Speaker 2>But then you're also capable of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different kind of invitation and that </v>

868
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:43.844
<v Speaker 2>invitation is when I watched myself do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then I formulated into a </v>

869
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 2>concept and then I tell you the concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you decompose it so that you can use</v>

870
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:53.924
<v Speaker 2>it in your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what we're doing </v>

871
00:50:55.251 --> 00:50:56.084
<v Speaker 2>when we're telling stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's kind of low resolution </v>

872
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:00.950
<v Speaker 2>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

873
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably powerful communication</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as far as I can tell,</v>

874
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the basic unit of that narrative or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>frame of reference,</v>

875
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:08.474
<v Speaker 2>is this your somewhere because you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>localized in time and space and that </v>

876
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:14.570
<v Speaker 2>isn't as good as it could be for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason or another.</v>

877
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.403
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to improve it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some notions about what you </v>

878
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:23.570
<v Speaker 2>have to do in order to improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you act them out,</v>

879
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.583
<v Speaker 2>you implement them and I think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that all the time and I can't see </v>

880
00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.084
<v Speaker 2>how you can not do it because you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a technique for simplifying the </v>

881
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as far as I can tell,</v>

882
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:35.444
<v Speaker 2>this is the technique and so a basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>story was while I was here and then I </v>

883
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 2>went there and that was better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how I did it.</v>

884
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a pretty good story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not great,</v>

885
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:44.444
<v Speaker 2>but it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might listen to that or you might </v>

886
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:49.370
<v Speaker 2>watch it as a on a video like I did when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to figure out how to fix my</v>

887
00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 2>car stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

888
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's a story about how to fix a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereo.</v>

889
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.370
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's not a very good story.</v>

890
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like I didn't say it was a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>good story.</v>

891
00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.143
<v Speaker 2>I said it was the basic element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception and also of narrative </v>

892
00:52:03.921 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

893
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>and to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two things,</v>

894
00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:08.324
<v Speaker 2>united is a tremendously exciting </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility because one of the things </v>

895
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 2>that you may have noted about </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

896
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>this is something we talked a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my personality class,</v>

897
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a real disjunction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between narrative psychology,</v>

898
00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:22.960
<v Speaker 2>which generally tends to be by </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic and,</v>

899
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 2>and neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

900
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:27.410
<v Speaker 2>and psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which tend to be,</v>

901
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.890
<v Speaker 2>while they're not narrative anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:52:29.891 --> 00:52:30.724
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we haven't been able to bridge the </v>

903
00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:32.804
<v Speaker 2>gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason I'm telling </v>

904
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:35.534
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things I'm telling you right now is </v>

905
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:41.290
<v Speaker 2>so that you can bridge the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an so an opt out of this.</v>

906
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:46.421
<v Speaker 2>And that's when we go to this next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this next diagram here.</v>

907
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have so many diagrams.</v>

908
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:06.761
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to keep track of the monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

909
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.063
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>

910
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've seen this before,</v>

911
00:53:16.621 --> 00:53:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but I want to walk through it again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's important and it's,</v>

912
00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:20.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

913
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.393
<v Speaker 2>it allows you to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconceptualization that unites things </v>

914
00:53:23.731 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that can't otherwise be united.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the one of the issues might be,</v>

915
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is an abstraction composed of?</v>

916
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

917
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the domain in which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction is being implemented.</v>

918
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:37.614
<v Speaker 2>So an abstraction about the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly different than an abstraction </v>

919
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what they have in common is that</v>

920
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 2>when you make abstract representations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

921
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you're making abstract representations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world as a place to act.</v>

922
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.763
<v Speaker 2>And that's a critically important thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand because we're scientific </v>

923
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 2>in our explicit cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>

924
00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.753
<v Speaker 2>We think that world models our world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our models of the world as a place of </v>

925
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:04.283
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're kind of taking a page from St </v>

926
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Augustine.</v>

927
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.553
<v Speaker 2>In some sense the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively existing independent </v>

928
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 2>material entities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you develop understanding about</v>

929
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.254
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is producing a map of </v>

930
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:21.900
<v Speaker 2>those entities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that's true in a narrow</v>

931
00:54:21.901 --> 00:54:24.690
<v Speaker 2>sense in that that is what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing science,</v>

932
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.703
<v Speaker 2>but science itself is nested inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative structure as we talked about </v>

933
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:29.304
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is what's the </v>

934
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 2>nature of the more comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative structure?</v>

935
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

936
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.550
<v Speaker 2>you cannot understand profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives unless you understand this,</v>

937
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:42.661
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

938
00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:43.920
<v Speaker 2>underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

939
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:49.090
<v Speaker 2>this underlying set of assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not naturally predisposed to view</v>

940
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:50.664
<v Speaker 2>the world in objective terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we talked about that from a </v>

941
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Newtonian point of view last time.</v>

942
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So when I told you what I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

943
00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 2>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the idea,</v>

944
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say we'll talk about the domain</v>

945
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 2>of morality.</v>

946
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.143
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that I put this under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate of morality is because it has to </v>

947
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 2>do with how you do act and how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should act.</v>

948
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.673
<v Speaker 2>So that's a moral domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say most of the time </v>

949
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:18.090
<v Speaker 2>when we're communicating information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we find relevant to one another,</v>

950
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:18.924
<v Speaker 2>what we're communicating is moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and the moral information </v>

951
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 2>is how to perceive and act in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>such that things work.</v>

952
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously you can have a debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what those things are,</v>

953
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 2>but that's still what we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

954
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 2>And you can debate about what work means</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on and so forth.</v>

955
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:35.220
<v Speaker 2>And we're doing that all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's complex.</v>

956
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 2>So if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

957
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.030
<v Speaker 2>you're a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we could unpack that.</v>

958
00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:42.571
<v Speaker 2>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

959
00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 2>well what are the snakes inside being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good person?</v>

960
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a higher.</v>

961
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:47.123
<v Speaker 2>It's actually good person is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of a complex hierarchy </v>

962
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 2>and so I've outlined some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy here.</v>

963
00:55:52.831 --> 00:55:55.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one element of being a good person,</v>

964
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:56.933
<v Speaker 2>although maybe not a necessary element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one element is that you're a good </v>

965
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:00.924
<v Speaker 2>parent and then a sub element of that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can take care of your family </v>

966
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>and Isabell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An element of that might be that you can</v>

967
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 2>play with the baby or that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>cook a meal.</v>

968
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't have to hit a home run on </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single one of the constituents,</v>

969
00:56:13.461 --> 00:56:17.790
<v Speaker 2>sub elements of the entire category in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to qualify as a good person,</v>

970
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but you can see that there's a shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

971
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.833
<v Speaker 2>You know that people recognize that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of a good person that's </v>

972
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:26.614
<v Speaker 2>actually composed of action patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions has nothing to do in some </v>

973
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>sense with the objective world.</v>

974
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>

975
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:36.400
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to play with the baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>while then you think,</v>

976
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:37.234
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you have to do to play with the </v>

977
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 2>baby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

978
00:56:39.701 --> 00:56:40.534
<v Speaker 2>we might make a goofy face out the baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>because babies respond to that sort of </v>

979
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes by crying,</v>

980
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 2>but often by smiling you can tickle </v>
<v Speaker 2>their feet.</v>

981
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of poke them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can play with their arms,</v>

982
00:56:50.051 --> 00:56:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can rock them back and forth.</v>

983
00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 2>There's and you watch the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you find out if it's having fun too.</v>

984
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:56.194
<v Speaker 2>And now the thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about actually playing with the baby is </v>

985
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

986
00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 2>the phenomena that you're manifesting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer abstract and conceptual.</v>

987
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:08.883
<v Speaker 2>It's embodied play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decomposes into movement patterns of </v>

988
00:57:12.611 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 2>movements like a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

989
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:14.794
<v Speaker 2>if you take a mother and she's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with her baby and you videotape </v>

990
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 2>them interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see is that the mothers who get</v>

991
00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:22.324
<v Speaker 2>along with their baby are doing a dance </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and the baby is harmonized </v>

992
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:26.030
<v Speaker 2>with the mother.</v>

993
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 2>So there's this sort of melodic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluid dance.</v>

994
00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the baby that's not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with its mother,</v>

995
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:32.194
<v Speaker 2>it's more like having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone who disagrees with </v>

996
00:57:34.691 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything that you say in </v>
<v Speaker 2>random ways.</v>

997
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:38.523
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you start off an invitation to the </v>

998
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>conversation and they nail you with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>non sequitur,</v>

999
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.653
<v Speaker 2>so that's a nonstarter and then you try </v>
<v Speaker 2>it again and they nail you with </v>

1000
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:46.834
<v Speaker 2>something else that seems completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant and and so it's Jerky and </v>

1001
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 2>discontinuous and you see that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people interacting with children all the</v>

1002
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.504
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the reason why </v>

1003
00:57:56.771 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 2>people use dance as a mating strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1004
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:05.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this person capable of mutual,</v>

1005
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>harmonious imitation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not a perfect test,</v>

1006
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:09.664
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1007
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:12.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got.</v>

1008
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It's got some utility and it's so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>

1009
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 2>the abstract narrative representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a good person.</v>

1010
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.660
<v Speaker 2>That is not an objective category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1011
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 2>the abstract representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a good person,</v>

1012
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:30.510
<v Speaker 2>decomposes at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution into a sequence of actions,</v>

1013
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 2>and piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1014
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.034
<v Speaker 2>would say that while you learn those </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic actions as you're putting your </v>

1015
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:38.950
<v Speaker 2>nervous system together from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from birth until now,</v>

1016
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>so you're building yourself up at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom because so when you dance,</v>

1017
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.023
<v Speaker 2>you know there's certain movements you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make and those are movements </v>

1018
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:47.980
<v Speaker 2>that you could make in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that would also be useful.</v>

1019
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you're for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for piaget,</v>

1020
00:58:50.591 --> 00:58:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you build yourself from the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this hierarchy towards the top.</v>

1021
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

1022
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you might note is</v>

1023
00:58:58.061 --> 00:58:58.894
<v Speaker 2>that as you go up the chain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction arguments about what those </v>

1024
00:59:01.961 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 2>categories contained become more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely,</v>

1025
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you might say for example,</v>

1026
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.650
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>

1027
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:14.010
<v Speaker 2>to your mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that being able to</v>

1028
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:17.643
<v Speaker 2>prepare a decent meal is such an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important sub element of being a good </v>

1029
00:59:21.321 --> 00:59:23.270
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That if you fail to do it or can't,</v>

1030
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:24.104
<v Speaker 2>that actually means you're a bad person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see right away why that </v>

1031
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:28.034
<v Speaker 2>would provoke all sorts of arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that I'm </v>

1032
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 2>bringing this up is because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

1033
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.533
<v Speaker 2>we're engaged in a constant process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutual exploration to determine how </v>

1034
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:45.131
<v Speaker 2>these hierarchies are properly arranged </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what are necessary sub categories of</v>

1035
00:59:45.321 --> 00:59:46.154
<v Speaker 2>them and how those subcategories shoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be hierarchically instantiated </v>

1036
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:50.354
<v Speaker 2>with regards to one another and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have some agreement about that or we </v>

1037
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:55.450
<v Speaker 2>actually can't communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if,</v>

1038
00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 2>if my stance is you burn the vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad person and your stances,</v>

1039
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I burned the vegetables and who the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>cares about that?</v>

1040
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.973
<v Speaker 2>Then the fact that our hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>values are structured completely </v>

1041
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:07.724
<v Speaker 2>differently means we're gonna have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult time communicating and </v>

1042
01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:10.724
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a lot of conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how that conceptual structure </v>

1043
01:00:13.801 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 2>should be reorganized.</v>

1044
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:15.943
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're arguing with someone about </v>

1045
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 2>something important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to say,</v>

1046
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:21.134
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get our hierarchies are </v>

1047
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy succinct so that what you want</v>

1048
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 2>and what I want can happen at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1049
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.250
<v Speaker 2>And so that we understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can partly do that by talking.</v>

1050
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.633
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can also do it by suppressing the </v>

1051
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:38.624
<v Speaker 2>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we tend to do an awful lot or </v>

1052
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:43.580
<v Speaker 2>suppressing ourselves in favor of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other person and so forth and so on.</v>

1053
01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1054
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those places have known agreement are,</v>

1055
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:53.410
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like tunnels into a,</v>

1056
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.840
<v Speaker 2>the complex underlying reality that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with and places where the,</v>

1057
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>the nature of that,</v>

1058
01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:06.090
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the complexity of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that become apparent.</v>

1059
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.060
<v Speaker 2>And part of what happens as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that is people just don't</v>

1060
01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:11.490
<v Speaker 2>have those discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to do it.</v>

1061
01:01:11.491 --> 01:01:14.080
<v Speaker 2>They can't decompose the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1062
01:01:14.081 --> 01:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>and I can give you an example of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're going to face.</v>

1063
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.113
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're in a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're married to someone or whatever </v>

1064
01:01:20.731 --> 01:01:21.564
<v Speaker 2>the equivalent happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You both have a career whose career is </v>

1065
01:01:24.361 --> 01:01:26.580
<v Speaker 2>more important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1066
01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:27.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1067
01:01:27.301 --> 01:01:28.134
<v Speaker 2>It's like it matters because there will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be times when you have to make a choice </v>

1068
01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.650
<v Speaker 2>between the two career paths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1069
01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you do that?</v>

1070
01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:39.270
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>and neither does anyone else,</v>

1071
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.223
<v Speaker 2>and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no rules for having a </v>

1072
01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:42.654
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to come up with all the rules </v>

1073
01:01:44.131 --> 01:01:44.964
<v Speaker 2>and everything about the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't even tell when you're </v>

1074
01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:48.070
<v Speaker 2>being reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.170
<v Speaker 2>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1076
01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.490
<v Speaker 2>the person who makes the most money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers,</v>

1077
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.343
<v Speaker 2>the most important,</v>

1078
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:53.443
<v Speaker 3>it's like</v>

1079
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you are you going to accept that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that's valid?</v>

1080
01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1081
01:01:58.981 --> 01:01:59.814
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to use it as an </v>

1082
01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>alternative criteria?</v>

1083
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.490
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

1084
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

1085
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>You know when most of the way we solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as collectives,</v>

1086
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:14.411
<v Speaker 2>as we have standard hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives that we just all adopt.</v>

1087
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our identity with our history.</v>

1088
01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:18.254
<v Speaker 2>That's a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you adopt your role in mine and my </v>

1089
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:22.284
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy is structured to take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>role into account and the reverse is </v>

1090
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 2>also true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to have a conflict.</v>

1091
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Now you might have a conflict as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual with your role.</v>

1092
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you pop out of your role,</v>

1093
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.334
<v Speaker 2>and I pop out of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in no man's land and in no man's </v>

1094
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three things happen.</v>

1095
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>

1096
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 2>or negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people can't negotiate.</v>

1097
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is it's too damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

1098
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:50.843
<v Speaker 2>What time is it?</v>

1099
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.793
<v Speaker 3>10 after two?</v>

1100
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a break.</v>

1101
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For,</v>

1102
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.820
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes.</v>
