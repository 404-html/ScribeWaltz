1
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.703
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>takes so long to to to talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon thing,</v>

3
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 2>man took me a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me a long,</v>

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>long time to figure out how to separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out from the other archetypes,</v>

5
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all right.</v>

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.803
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to bang through a bunch of </v>

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 2>images here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an l chemical</v>

8
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

9
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 2>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>So you can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.523
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about this as a map of </v>

12
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.624
<v Speaker 2>psychological development or you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about this as a representation of </v>

13
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 2>how potential reveals itself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>actuality.</v>

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>And it sort of works from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing you see there is that</v>

15
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:09.171
<v Speaker 2>container and if you notice the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>is emitting sperm into this thing that's</v>

16
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 2>like an aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then this egg thing has wings and</v>

17
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the round chaos I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about before.</v>

18
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the container of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it,</v>

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 2>you can think about it as the container </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what matters.</v>

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.043
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways of really thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about organizing your framework so that </v>

21
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:32.394
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way of understanding can work for </v>

22
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 2>you is to start thinking about the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being made out of what matters.</v>

23
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 2>And then you come into contact that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you come into contact with</v>

24
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>something that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now heidegger had an idea like this,</v>

25
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heidegger was very interested in.</v>

26
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.094
<v Speaker 2>He thought Western philosophy had gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>off its tracks in some sense with with </v>

27
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is unfair.</v>

28
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.004
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened is that western </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy developed immensely in one </v>

29
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 2>direction and left some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions,</v>

30
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784
<v Speaker 2>not very developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's fair to say that </v>

31
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:08.904
<v Speaker 2>socrates like derailed us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he helped us blow up and really a </v>

32
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>lot in one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But heidegger said,</v>

33
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not nothing that for awhile,</v>

34
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>it's too rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too limited.</v>

35
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.393
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

36
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it misses the central issue.</v>

37
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 2>For heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the central issue is what is being now.</v>

38
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 2>You might've heard about David chalmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody ever heard of David Chalmers?</v>

39
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so David chalmers got famous because he,</v>

40
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>he made this question about </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

41
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 2>He said there's the hard problem and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy problem of consciousness.</v>

42
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.283
<v Speaker 2>The hard problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is why we are conscious because his </v>

43
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 2>notion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is,</v>

44
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been that fond of it,</v>

45
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:51.954
<v Speaker 2>is that we could just as easily be </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally deterministic zombies machines </v>

46
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 2>with no consciousness whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>or we can't figure out why we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like that.</v>

48
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can build a robot.</v>

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.373
<v Speaker 2>Hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did everything that we did that </v>

50
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>wasn't conscious now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we couldn't,</v>

51
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what is consciousness and why is</v>

52
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.314
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's formulated that question </v>

53
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.283
<v Speaker 2>is formulated improperly because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard question is way harder than </v>

54
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.473
<v Speaker 2>trauma is hard question because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of being is a harder question </v>

55
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.824
<v Speaker 2>and the question of being is why is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there anything at all and what is it </v>

56
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

57
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think that's distinguishable</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

58
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.833
<v Speaker 2>from the hard question because in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense there isn't anything without </v>

59
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or that's one way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at things now.</v>

60
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>So that's the container of what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then out of that,</v>

61
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.643
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as generalized and abstract as </v>

62
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you can possibly get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

63
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 2>it's what's similar across every </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance of what matters.</v>

64
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:02.304
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heidegger also thought that our basic </v>

65
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:04.104
<v Speaker 2>orientation to the world was one of care</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was trying to qualify our </v>

66
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is our experience like?</v>

67
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Or he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is human being like?</v>

68
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he said is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

69
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.774
<v Speaker 2>it seems to involve care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We care about things or we don't care </v>

70
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:18.804
<v Speaker 2>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

71
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 2>but care is central to what it means to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be human.</v>

72
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.530
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

73
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 2>the contact between those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that set of ideas in this is that one of</v>

74
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:35.211
<v Speaker 2>the aspects of being is that it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

75
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it doesn't matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it appears to be,</v>

76
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:39.564
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like we're still concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what matters were very hurt when </v>

77
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>nothing matters anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

78
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:47.454
<v Speaker 2>And I would say part of what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>when nothing matters anymore is we're </v>

79
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:54.831
<v Speaker 2>completely blinded by our map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The map is blinding us completely to the</v>

80
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:57.834
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spiral downward as a consequence of </v>

81
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:03.144
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening here is that what </v>

82
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:05.544
<v Speaker 2>matters itself first manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this horrific dragon like form because </v>

83
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so</v>

84
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.753
<v Speaker 2>because what you don't understand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's anomalous to you is certainly </v>

85
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:23.821
<v Speaker 2>capable of devouring you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's paradoxical because,</v>

86
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.893
<v Speaker 2>and this is why these archetypes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>also so complex because logical people </v>

87
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>always say everything is either one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

88
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not itself and the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself at the same time,</v>

89
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's a like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a prerequisite for,</v>

90
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>for the world that you can apprehend </v>
<v Speaker 2>logically.</v>

91
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

92
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Lots of things are what they are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what and the opposite of what they are.</v>

93
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are like that.</v>

94
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you can hate someone and love them </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>

95
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:55.564
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can be a hateable and the </v>

96
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:02.171
<v Speaker 2>lovable object at exactly the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Life can be wonderful and tragic and</v>

97
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:03.854
<v Speaker 2>cruel at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like so the archetypes are actually </v>

98
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>partly there.</v>

99
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.913
<v Speaker 2>So to help us represent entities or </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences or classes have experienced </v>

100
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>that don't have a logical framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't separate the bloody things out.</v>

101
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>They always confront us as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a unity,</v>

102
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.944
<v Speaker 2>and so the dragon figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the predatory reptile is like that </v>

103
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 2>because you might say without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory reptiles,</v>

104
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 2>there's no gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you might ask,</v>

105
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the reptile worth the gold?</v>

106
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

107
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe the gold is worth more than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reptile.</v>

108
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically what human beings are </v>

109
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:39.824
<v Speaker 2>betting on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're betting that if we confront the </v>

110
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.184
<v Speaker 2>unknown and we gathered the treasure for</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered the information as a </v>

111
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will help us beat the dragon.</v>

112
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

113
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>the gold is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more than the dragon,</v>

114
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>better be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 2>but we're betting on that and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not terror management.</v>

116
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole different idea.</v>

117
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not a delusion or an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bet.</v>

118
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 2>And part of the bed is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a character guardian idea.</v>

119
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could live as if it's true.</v>

120
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And kierkegaard would say if you live as</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's true,</v>

121
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.063
<v Speaker 2>then it might become true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll never know unless you try to </v>

122
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 2>live as if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the act of faith from a character</v>

123
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:22.604
<v Speaker 2>guardian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to a priority decide that that </v>

124
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:28.244
<v Speaker 2>will work and then you have to follow it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be willing to see where </v>

125
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:32.594
<v Speaker 2>it leads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I talked about this in one of my </v>

126
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 2>other classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I finally got it right,</v>

127
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 2>and in some ways this is something we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about because I think this is,</v>

128
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>this is a critical choice that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

129
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>So here's two ways to use language.</v>

130
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say I'm going to pick up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl in a bar.</v>

131
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a goal in mind and the goal is</v>

132
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 2>sort of the girls irrelevant to the goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so far as she could be another girl.</v>

133
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

134
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.153
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a psychopathic goal in some ways </v>

135
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 2>because it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

136
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 2>because the individual doesn't matter if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

137
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:05.861
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

138
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an so what I'm going to do,</v>

139
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.763
<v Speaker 2>say if I'm a pickup artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow these pickup artists online a </v>

140
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:12.884
<v Speaker 2>because I'm so curious about their use </v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychology and all they ever do is </v>

141
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:16.844
<v Speaker 2>come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole horde of man talking </v>

142
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 2>about how to deceive and manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

143
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely psychopathic.</v>

144
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it's very,</v>

145
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:27.591
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

146
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.424
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unsophisticated and unskilled </v>

147
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.513
<v Speaker 2>because what the guys are lumps </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically and what they're trying to do </v>

148
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 2>is to acquire the veneer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication.</v>

149
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's psychopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

150
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>that's my little spiel on pickup </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists,</v>

151
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.173
<v Speaker 2>but they're very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're doing is teaching their </v>

152
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.234
<v Speaker 2>followers instrumental language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so if you want to sleep with a </v>

153
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how to do it,</v>

154
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.890
<v Speaker 2>here's how to manipulate her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:53.724
<v Speaker 2>and they have a bunch of tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're an expensive watch and dress </v>

156
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>up and also don't just dress up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dress up rich,</v>

157
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.073
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also add something peculiar to your </v>

158
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 2>wardrobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like something that really stands out as</v>

159
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.743
<v Speaker 2>somewhat odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call that peacocking so that the </v>

160
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 2>girl can see that not only are you rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>and successful,</v>

161
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:12.534
<v Speaker 2>but you've got that little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuality that sets you apart from </v>

162
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 2>all the other rich and successful guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

163
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.773
<v Speaker 2>And so that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Cyrus Horace combination </v>

164
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.204
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all bullshit because the guys </v>

165
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:23.364
<v Speaker 2>aren't like that so it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and then they have all these little </v>

166
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:26.574
<v Speaker 2>routines they use that are verbal </v>
<v Speaker 2>routines and they have these guys they </v>

167
00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>go to the bar with to help them with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their little routines and it's like it's</v>

168
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 2>completely what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're using language instrumentally.</v>

169
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.283
<v Speaker 2>They have a goal in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is their goal and they know that </v>

170
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.523
<v Speaker 2>what the goal is and they know that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is right in so far as they're </v>

171
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:43.764
<v Speaker 2>pursuing the goal and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to say anything to obtain that </v>

172
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:48.924
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

173
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

174
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the instrumental use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

175
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.060
<v Speaker 2>What do you do if you're not using </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrumental language?</v>

176
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.913
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you try to communicate </v>

177
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:07.490
<v Speaker 2>about the situation and your response to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation.</v>

178
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:08.324
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as clearly and accurately and </v>

179
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:15.731
<v Speaker 2>articulately as you possibly can all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and see what happens.</v>

180
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.313
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the proposition there is to the degree </v>

181
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:23.960
<v Speaker 2>that you're</v>

182
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 2>transforming your experience into </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

183
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.543
<v Speaker 2>into articulated reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that will follow from that </v>

184
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.300
<v Speaker 2>will be the best things that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly be,</v>

185
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.560
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an openness in that approach.</v>

186
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:43.394
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm going to conduct my </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with person x in the most </v>

187
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 2>truthful possible manner and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what happens.</v>

188
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.733
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also going to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens is the best thing that </v>

189
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:54.944
<v Speaker 2>could have happened because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell do you know if it's the </v>

190
00:10:56.571 --> 00:10:59.270
<v Speaker 2>best thing that could've happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the person's all offended,</v>

191
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 2>near rotated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this with my clients a lot.</v>

192
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:02.444
<v Speaker 2>So especially with the agreeable one say</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're all bent out of shape </v>

193
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 2>with resentment because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something,</v>

194
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so and you know,</v>

195
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 2>and because they're not saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

196
00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.670
<v Speaker 2>they're getting shepherded into some </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation they don't want to be in.</v>

197
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:14.504
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to go live with someone they </v>

198
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 2>don't want to live with and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

199
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves because that'll hurt </v>

200
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:21.530
<v Speaker 2>someone's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

201
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:22.364
<v Speaker 2>so we talk about that in a bunch and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out how you could say what you </v>

202
00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:28.940
<v Speaker 2>actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usually what happens is they say,</v>

203
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:32.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get in a whole bunch of trouble and</v>

204
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 2>then two days later the problem goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

205
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.103
<v Speaker 2>so they're afraid to say what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually using silence instrumentally </v>

206
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.980
<v Speaker 2>basically because their idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fight with you.</v>

207
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do I not fight with you?</v>

208
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't say anything that will upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

209
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>so I will upset you when exactly you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

210
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:55.504
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an intimate partner with </v>

211
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>someone and you see them doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid repeatedly,</v>

212
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.870
<v Speaker 2>that is going to lead them into a pit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month or two months or a year,</v>

213
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to say,</v>

214
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:07.264
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna fight with you just </v>

215
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:08.974
<v Speaker 2>because that'll be trouble because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner or later they're going to fall </v>

216
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 2>into a pit and that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble too,</v>

217
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>so you're not doing them any favors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just for stalling the catastrophe</v>

218
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 2>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful.</v>

219
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 2>We're instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

220
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.274
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how it looks to me and this is </v>

221
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 2>how it looks.</v>

222
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.393
<v Speaker 2>It looks to me like this is where this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going and you probably don't want to </v>

223
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.174
<v Speaker 2>go there and even if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to aid and abet and then </v>

224
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:31.594
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get all upset and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to tell you that you're </v>

225
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:34.024
<v Speaker 2>interfering and that you're mean and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruel and that you can only see the bad </v>

226
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:37.284
<v Speaker 2>in things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you withstand all that and </v>

227
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get really angry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomp out,</v>

228
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:41.314
<v Speaker 2>and if you can withstand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to cry and tell you </v>

229
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 2>your son of a bitch and mean and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they never want to talk to you again.</v>

230
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll go home and think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

231
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Then a week later they'll come back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

232
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I never want to see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

233
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Or they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

234
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:55.594
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that and what you said </v>

235
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:57.994
<v Speaker 2>made sense and I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to do something about </v>

236
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

237
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.810
<v Speaker 2>But you have to decide to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you,</v>

238
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're willing to risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of the truth.</v>

239
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean you get to use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth as a weapon.</v>

240
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not truthful.</v>

241
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>You can use the truth as a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

242
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.040
<v Speaker 2>if you see someone who's</v>

243
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.920
<v Speaker 2>perhaps not as attractive as they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

244
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.370
<v Speaker 2>you could say your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your rather ugly,</v>

245
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in some senses of the truth,</v>

246
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a statement about,</v>

247
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the truth at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because for it to be the truth,</v>

248
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:34.794
<v Speaker 2>it has to be embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it really has to be is embedded in </v>

249
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:41.961
<v Speaker 2>the ocirus horace pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what your audience has to serve</v>

250
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.260
<v Speaker 2>the entire function of that integrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>unit.</v>

251
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 2>It has to serve tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to serve enlightenment.</v>

252
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.853
<v Speaker 2>It has to serve vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it isn't doing any of those </v>

253
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:53.670
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the truth.</v>

254
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's the truth in this local </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny slice,</v>

255
00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:58.860
<v Speaker 2>you know I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just told you the truth.</v>

256
00:13:58.861 --> 00:13:59.694
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

257
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You took a little fragment of what could</v>

258
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:06.480
<v Speaker 2>be interpreted to be the truth and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned it into a bat and then you hit me</v>

259
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:07.314
<v Speaker 2>with the bat and then you defended </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself by a false argument that's </v>

260
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:12.780
<v Speaker 2>claiming that when you use the truth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local manner like that,</v>

261
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.730
<v Speaker 2>you're actually moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

262
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:15.564
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly deceptive because you </v>

263
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.404
<v Speaker 2>know the best way to deceive someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to sort of tell them the truth and </v>

264
00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:24.144
<v Speaker 2>then you not only you can really get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person than a because not only are you </v>

265
00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:31.254
<v Speaker 2>innocent because you've told the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are even more guilty because </v>

266
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.310
<v Speaker 2>they're too weak to handle the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>

267
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:37.290
<v Speaker 2>you can really wall up someone with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

268
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:38.124
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

269
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.723
<v Speaker 2>that's the container of what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at first manifests itself in this </v>

270
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.910
<v Speaker 2>potentially horrific form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>

271
00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you willing,</v>

272
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>willing to confront that and in what way</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you willing to confront it?</v>

273
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 2>And then out of that arises at the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>

274
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>That's illumination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

275
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe the night first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a crescent moon,</v>

276
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 2>although I might be wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a crescent moon.</v>

277
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.233
<v Speaker 2>What arises out of that is the contents </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unconsciousness and then finally </v>

278
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 2>illumination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.780
<v Speaker 2>so it's like horace arising from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depths.</v>

280
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:15.614
<v Speaker 2>It's a story of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The transformation of what matters into </v>

281
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.560
<v Speaker 2>illumination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that means.</v>

282
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.613
<v Speaker 2>So this is Jonah and what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonah roughly speaking is that God told </v>

283
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 2>him he was supposed to go somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to go there.</v>

284
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:34.934
<v Speaker 2>And so he got on a boat and then there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a big storm and none of the sailors </v>

285
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>knew why the storm came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jonah finally said,</v>

286
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:43.934
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably my fault because God told </v>

287
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 2>me to go do something and I didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

288
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>So God sent the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they take John and they throw him off</v>

289
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 2>the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:52.734
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's okay with that because it's his </v>

291
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:54.644
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the waters calm and then this </v>

292
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.174
<v Speaker 2>big whale comes up and swallows them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it spits them out on the ground </v>

293
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 2>three days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

294
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 2>So what's the idea there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

295
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:11.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first idea is that if you're cold,</v>

296
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.074
<v Speaker 2>you better listen.</v>

297
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the first idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know people,</v>

298
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 2>modern people never believe that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>called to do anything,</v>

299
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's because they're not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright and they don't pay any attention.</v>

300
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know perfectly well that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>called to do things because now and then</v>

301
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 2>you know that you should have said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

302
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>You know it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't know should have you</v>

303
00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 2>said something should have united said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you don't know so fine.</v>

304
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.224
<v Speaker 2>You're not culpable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lots of times you bloody well know </v>

305
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:35.894
<v Speaker 2>that you should have done something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have said something or you </v>

306
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:38.534
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have done something or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have said something and you </v>

307
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 2>went ahead and did it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

308
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 2>part of the moral of this story is </v>
<v Speaker 2>beware of doing such things.</v>

309
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't listen,</v>

310
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 2>something will come up from the depths </v>
<v Speaker 2>and swallow you.</v>

311
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 2>And if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll spit you back up three days later.</v>

312
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:57.854
<v Speaker 2>But it's not necessary that it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might just swallow you and that will </v>

313
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>be the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

314
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 2>when I've seen people who are tangled up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in such trouble,</v>

315
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:09.370
<v Speaker 2>they don't have enough life left to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's usually the consequence of,</v>

316
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to calculate it.</v>

317
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible to make 100 bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions a day,</v>

318
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.483
<v Speaker 2>maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly a hundred and those </v>

319
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 2>hundred bad decisions are usually sins </v>
<v Speaker 2>of omission.</v>

320
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 2>They're usually things that you know you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should do and then you just don't.</v>

321
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>So there are things you should explore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't.</v>

322
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 2>There are things that you should say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't.</v>

323
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>There are obligations that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertake and you don't.</v>

324
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's passive avoidance in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's willful blindness.</v>

325
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Just like the kind of willful blindness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doomed.</v>

326
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not active repression,</v>

327
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just failure to engage when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you should.</v>

328
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that at a hundred times in a day </v>

329
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's like seven in a week and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 in a month roughly speaking,</v>

330
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.124
<v Speaker 2>and it's 36,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a year and then you do that for 10 </v>

331
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 360,000,</v>

332
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:02.121
<v Speaker 2>so then you have 360,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>things lying around you that you have to</v>

333
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.004
<v Speaker 2>fix and the problem is while you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>even fix one of those things when they </v>

334
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 2>popped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's how Taya Matt Reappears,</v>

335
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.383
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's little monsters they pop up and </v>

336
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you could whack them with a hammer like </v>
<v Speaker 2>whackable,</v>

337
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:21.351
<v Speaker 2>no problem if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't do that for 360,000</v>

338
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:22.584
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they all aggregate into this </v>

339
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.744
<v Speaker 2>looming chaos monster and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that that thing's going to </v>

340
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:28.794
<v Speaker 2>eat us or that you're going to live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>its belly because that's where you end </v>

341
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:35.514
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very bad idea and it's often the </v>

342
00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:39.664
<v Speaker 2>case that people just don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and energy left or willpower or </v>

343
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 2>character by that time because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying their own character there.</v>

344
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:48.340
<v Speaker 2>They've had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot help them.</v>

345
00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You cannot fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>

346
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.540
<v Speaker 2>They can't be rescued from hell.</v>

347
00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.461
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>

348
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

349
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:01.314
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

350
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 2>remember I told you about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments with the married couples,</v>

351
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.993
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are going to get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk into the little bed and </v>

352
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 2>breakfast and it's high deer and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of no,</v>

353
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 2>no ice smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

354
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a predatory smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I kinda like you,</v>

355
00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 2>but these are really teeth and there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

356
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it's not pleasant.</v>

357
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And so they're interacting with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

358
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>

359
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:24.594
<v Speaker 2>they're not nice at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're carnivorous rate to the damn </v>

360
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 2>core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on the surface it's all roses and</v>

361
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 2>sunshine and like a little inch below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all like their,</v>

362
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.373
<v Speaker 2>like if you could see their unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd see two people with their hands </v>

363
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:40.134
<v Speaker 2>around each other's throat and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>body knows that because up go to the </v>

364
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:44.880
<v Speaker 2>cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up goes to the heart rate.</v>

365
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>They're sweating away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

367
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 2>And your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's smart,</v>

368
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>it knows where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

369
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can ignore it,</v>

370
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 2>which you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

371
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

372
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 2>this isn't too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

373
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:01.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

374
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really bad.</v>

375
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.750
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

376
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 2>really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that long enough.</v>

377
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like good luck for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you've,</v>

378
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.533
<v Speaker 2>you've polluted your psyche and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>surroundings to such a degree that you </v>

379
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:16.644
<v Speaker 2>can't fix it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets worse than that because if you </v>

380
00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:22.440
<v Speaker 2>stay there long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't even want to fix it.</v>

381
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.330
<v Speaker 2>You'll be so angry at yourself or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other person that you're going to try as</v>

382
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:28.164
<v Speaker 2>hard as you can to do everything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly can to make it as bad as you </v>

383
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:32.964
<v Speaker 2>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since you have virtually an </v>

384
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>unlimited imagination for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can get really bad.</v>

385
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>So when you get into a self sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiral at some point,</v>

386
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hellish descent,</v>

387
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that hell is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because no matter how bad it is,</v>

388
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 2>there's some damn devious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>

389
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:52.684
<v Speaker 2>horrible little thing that you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will do that will make it </v>

390
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

391
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who think that hell isn't real,</v>

392
00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:03.500
<v Speaker 2>they are just not paying any attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

393
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:08.870
<v Speaker 2>It's plenty real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some other representations of</v>

394
00:21:09.211 --> 00:21:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily he got back up.</v>

395
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.033
<v Speaker 2>Same idea that wouldn't be in such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly successful movie if it </v>

396
00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:28.220
<v Speaker 2>wasn't archetipal to the core and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just relates and archetipal tail.</v>

397
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's brave man against horrific beast</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the depths Greek.</v>

398
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.343
<v Speaker 2>So those are the Greeks going after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydro and you see the circle at the </v>

399
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:46.540
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the hydro there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a symbol of infinity.</v>

400
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And so what did the Greeks doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're tackling infinity.</v>

401
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Well that is what the Greeks did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we still remember them.</v>

402
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like those characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were tough people,</v>

403
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.743
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about them that was </v>

404
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 2>truly remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

405
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 2>there was only 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Athens,</v>

406
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what was up with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they certainly got this part right.</v>

407
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe what was up with them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they thought of themselves.</v>

408
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're not running away.</v>

409
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make a pretty strong case that</v>

410
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 2>if a seven headed snake</v>

411
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.420
<v Speaker 2>with infinite length came rolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards you,</v>

412
00:22:21.421 --> 00:22:23.190
<v Speaker 2>it's time to head for the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

413
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Not like stand there with your bronze </v>
<v Speaker 2>ax.</v>

414
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Is there any things like that?</v>

415
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't conscious.</v>

416
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It was mimic mimicry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how you do it too.</v>

417
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go to a movie,</v>

418
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>go iron man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iron Mans mythological to the core,</v>

419
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.540
<v Speaker 2>especially the avengers movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had a brilliant mythological feet and</v>

420
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go there and watch iron man </v>

421
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 2>and then come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

422
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:01.924
<v Speaker 2>let's decode iron man into his </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral micro elements and </v>

423
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:07.570
<v Speaker 2>incorporate those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that.</v>

424
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 2>You're gripped by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gripped by it.</v>

425
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And the transmission of information is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a level that's below articulation.</v>

426
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.253
<v Speaker 2>It's images stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's modifying the structure </v>

427
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the contents of your right hemisphere</v>

428
00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:23.550
<v Speaker 2>who god only knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

429
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 2>it's embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 2>that's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

431
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:30.340
<v Speaker 2>You take a kid out to see a superman </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and then you bring them home.</v>

432
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.174
<v Speaker 2>What do they want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to put on a little Superman </v>

433
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Cape and wander around being superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.543
<v Speaker 2>and that's the level at which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information is being transmitted so </v>

435
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:40.541
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

436
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:41.374
<v Speaker 2>what superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what will play that out and to the </v>

437
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 2>degree that you can play it out.</v>

438
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.213
<v Speaker 2>Then the superman element in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can mimic it now becomes part of </v>

439
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 2>your behavioral repertoire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did they know what they were doing?</v>

440
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.433
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you mean by no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could they fully articulate what they </v>

441
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 2>were doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

442
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 2>but neither can we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they knew.</v>

443
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.833
<v Speaker 2>Like they weren't taking something they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew in an articulated form and saying </v>

444
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:13.480
<v Speaker 2>let's represent it as a hydro and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero.</v>

445
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.413
<v Speaker 2>It's completely the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we don't know what the hell </v>

446
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:16.694
<v Speaker 2>we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems sort of like a guy with a </v>

447
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 2>bronze ax attacking a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

448
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 2>what kind of snake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

449
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 2>it's an infinite snake with many heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

450
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>And that would have been a work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

451
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe conscious imagination,</v>

452
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:29.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like because those are artistic </v>

453
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 2>productions definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're products of fantasy.</v>

454
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 2>So this chaos monster dragon breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself into two things.</v>

455
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.813
<v Speaker 2>That's the initial differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it breaks itself into the great </v>

456
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 2>father and the great mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the emergent.</v>

457
00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's the great mother in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges first and a great father second.</v>

458
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:52.724
<v Speaker 2>Although you can't really say that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the myths work is that three </v>

459
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 2>things emerge at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great mother,</v>

460
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you confronted and the great father,</v>

461
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 2>which is you as a reader and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero,</v>

462
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:07.394
<v Speaker 2>which is you as an active agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say one of those proceeds the </v>

463
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't how it works in the myths</v>

464
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 2>that just says no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as things splint,</v>

465
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what they split into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something,</v>

466
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:17.983
<v Speaker 2>there has to be the interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and there has to be the </v>

467
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:23.324
<v Speaker 2>interpreter.</v>

468
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Those are the fundamental elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

469
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea,</v>

470
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental elements of being are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a pool of information.</v>

471
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a reader of the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be,</v>

472
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh cyrus,</v>

473
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a reader,</v>

474
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 2>and so think about what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reading a book,</v>

475
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

476
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the book?</v>

477
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:43.971
<v Speaker 2>And you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

478
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 2>here's the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this little chunk of wood fiber.</v>

479
00:25:47.931 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

480
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what your visual system deludes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you into thinking when you're using it.</v>

481
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 2>That's not the book at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book contains patterns.</v>

482
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It contains representations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral patterns and the way that you</v>

483
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 2>interpret those behavioral patterns is </v>
<v Speaker 2>by using the reader that's in your head,</v>

484
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:08.024
<v Speaker 2>which is really that structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchical structure that I </v>

485
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.913
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you didn't have that in your </v>

486
00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:14.240
<v Speaker 2>damn had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't understand the book.</v>

487
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.283
<v Speaker 2>Because the only thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you and I are talking and we're </v>

488
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 2>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot we have to agree on.</v>

489
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Before we could even say anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>which we might disagree.</v>

490
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm writing a book for you people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

491
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.093
<v Speaker 2>as the readers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I have to do is assume a bunch of </v>

492
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:31.244
<v Speaker 2>things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then I don't have to say those </v>

493
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:36.090
<v Speaker 2>things because it would take an infinite</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time.</v>

494
00:26:36.091 --> 00:26:36.924
<v Speaker 2>Just say everything that I need to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have to assume that there's a </v>

495
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:39.974
<v Speaker 2>trillion things I don't have to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I already know that you know </v>

496
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 2>them and so then I can play at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fringes with those things.</v>

497
00:26:45.631 --> 00:26:50.631
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can lay out a story about my character</v>

498
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 2>becoming angry and I don't have to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you,</v>

499
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we can tell he's angry because </v>

500
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:58.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brow is furrowed and you know,</v>

501
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 2>he's starting to sweat and there's a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste in his mouth and if you're angry,</v>

502
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 2>that's how you feel.</v>

503
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And because you already knew all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have to bother with that.</v>

504
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

505
00:27:06.801 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just set up the situation and Poof,</v>

506
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know what anger means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] means you know,</v>

507
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>what love means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

508
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.153
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why thE reader has to be </v>

509
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing to read,</v>

510
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.870
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

511
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 2>the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interpreter has to be there.</v>

512
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreter interpretation and the thing</v>

513
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:29.460
<v Speaker 2>that's being interpreted have to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out at the same time.</v>

514
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Poof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'S the,</v>

515
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.320
<v Speaker 2>the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great mother and the great father,</v>

516
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 2>so that's how they pop out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

517
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.200
<v Speaker 2>let me show you some cool things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There they are.</v>

518
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Students sent me the one on the left.</v>

519
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 2>That's an ancient chinese representation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that one's great.</v>

520
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

521
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 2>You have the dragon in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the snake with the knot and its tail.</v>

522
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 2>That's ancient greek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt and it's.</v>

523
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.323
<v Speaker 2>It's chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very old chinese representation </v>

524
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and out of the snake pops the divine </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

525
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>

526
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because the one of the </v>

527
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:06.414
<v Speaker 2>primary things that emerges out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>undifferentiated reality for human </v>

528
00:28:09.511 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 2>beings is the male and the female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father and the mother.</v>

529
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the first things you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>into contact with.</v>

530
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.420
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you emerge out of the void,</v>

531
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's archetipal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know who our father is,</v>

532
00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 2>we know who her mother is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the.</v>

533
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.170
<v Speaker 2>That differentiation of the genders.</v>

534
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.970
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

535
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's leave it there.</v>

537
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.703
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've gone into the great mother in </v>

538
00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:38.704
<v Speaker 2>the great father and I'm going to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>you their symbolic representation and </v>

539
00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:44.830
<v Speaker 2>they're positive because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that happens is you get the great</v>

540
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:45.664
<v Speaker 2>mother and the great father pop up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the next thing is that they </v>

541
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:48.694
<v Speaker 2>differentiate again and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiate into positive mother and </v>

542
00:28:51.551 --> 00:28:54.370
<v Speaker 2>negative mother and paused a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a negative father,</v>

543
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.413
<v Speaker 2>and then out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the same time the cross the </v>

544
00:28:58.271 --> 00:28:59.104
<v Speaker 2>product of those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the hero that also emerges and </v>

545
00:29:02.021 --> 00:29:05.170
<v Speaker 2>it's differentiates into the hero and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the adversary.</v>

546
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And so then you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have enough.</v>

547
00:29:09.351 --> 00:29:10.184
<v Speaker 2>At that point you have enough different </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation at that point in terms </v>

548
00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:15.980
<v Speaker 2>of representation that you can basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulate the whole world.</v>

549
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.820
<v Speaker 2>And so that's at the base of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptual structures.</v>
