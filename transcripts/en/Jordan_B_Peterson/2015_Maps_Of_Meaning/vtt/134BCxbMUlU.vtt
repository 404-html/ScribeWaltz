1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.660
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroic path is,</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>is laid out in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.383
<v Speaker 1>as a metta path by religious systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically as the road to redemption and </v>

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>the redemption is redemption from chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from tyranny.</v>

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>It's redemption from both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.824
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the transcendent space that those </v>

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>metta stories exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a divine archetype,</v>

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the successful hero.</v>

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>But then that's an archetype mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're doing everything right </v>

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.793
<v Speaker 1>and then your family gets killed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car accident and you slip and fall down </v>

12
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>the stairs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a concussion and maybe you wake</v>

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>up in your brain damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then while you're recovering,</v>

15
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you get hit by some other illness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that often a one,</v>

16
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>two punch like that will often really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt people,</v>

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite fragile and they're pretty hurt.</v>

19
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And then something else comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wax them and you know,</v>

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.953
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That identification with the archetypal </v>

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:08.844
<v Speaker 1>hero will stop those things from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening because there's an element of </v>

22
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>randomness in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

23
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be sensible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to say it's your best bet,</v>

24
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>which is a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no certain path,</v>

25
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>but given the range of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative outcomes,</v>

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>voluntary confrontation with emergent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally roughly speaking,</v>

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>gives you the best poker hand or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you the best poker player.</v>

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.333
<v Speaker 1>That would be a better way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it now so people can be </v>

29
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:49.041
<v Speaker 1>traumatized by my failure to update </v>
<v Speaker 1>their models because then the moral gets</v>

30
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>old like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

31
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's unable to see the tyranny,</v>

32
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.673
<v Speaker 1>plus it's archaic and can just get wiped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out because it no longer is adapted to </v>

33
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'd be like that if you were</v>

34
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>still using dos as an operating system.</v>

35
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfectly reasonable operating </v>

36
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

37
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It usually it used to really work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all you had to do was not update and</v>

38
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd be extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

39
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.153
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Mercia Eliana pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out was that one of the processes that </v>

40
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>sort of universally regarded as a sin in</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far as that's a universal conception,</v>

41
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>so you might think about it as a data </v>
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>

42
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.723
<v Speaker 1>is speeding along the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable decay through willful </v>

43
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.694
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things will decay of their own </v>

44
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>accord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be awake just to keep the</v>

45
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.174
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can speed the rate at which it </v>

46
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.044
<v Speaker 1>decays by pretending that nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and and refusing to change </v>

47
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you say,</v>

48
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only does it decay,</v>

49
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but your blindness is contributing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the decay.</v>

50
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's well in one of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about today,</v>

51
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>which is the flood story.</v>

52
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the underlying story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood is like God's pretty irritated</v>

53
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:11.374
<v Speaker 1>that everybody's blind and stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's particularly irritated that </v>

54
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.024
<v Speaker 1>they stay blind and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the consequence of that is </v>

55
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>everything gets washed away and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is the consequences of that.</v>

56
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So when the ancient Hebrews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're imagining that story,</v>

57
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when modern people look at that story,</v>

58
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.301
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>what kind of God would do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about New Orleans.</v>

61
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Why did New Orleans get washed away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>one answer is hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good answer.</v>

63
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>But the other answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe they should've made the dike </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger like they knew for the last 100</v>

65
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.724
<v Speaker 1>years and maybe all the money that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be spent on the dikes </v>

66
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have got diverted into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets of corrupt politicians.</v>

67
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And so then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:54.214
<v Speaker 1>why did New Orleans get flooded </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricane or the sins of man and the </v>

69
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 1>tendency of things to decaying.</v>

70
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is,</v>

71
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>is that they're both equally potent </v>
<v Speaker 1>causal elements.</v>

72
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.923
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your city collapses because your </v>

73
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>engineers have built the concrete with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sand,</v>

74
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>which happens all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.963
<v Speaker 1>Like especially in corrupt countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they don't make the concrete </v>

76
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>properly because it's cheaper just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill it with sand.</v>

77
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>The whole bloody city falls over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

78
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>is that the earthquake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While.</v>

79
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:27.874
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it wouldn't have happened </v>

80
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.224
<v Speaker 1>without the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also wouldn't have happened if </v>

81
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>people weren't corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and there's a constant,</v>

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.463
<v Speaker 1>that's the the dynamic between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible mother chaos and the terrible </v>

83
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:41.224
<v Speaker 1>father like and and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other dynamic there is also the </v>

84
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.674
<v Speaker 1>adversarial element of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't assess the situation without </v>

85
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:53.851
<v Speaker 1>taking those three causal forces into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into consideration simultaneously.</v>

86
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Someone just gave me a paper a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago linking corruption to poverty.</v>

87
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.003
<v Speaker 1>Now I knew that for a long time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the list of if you look </v>

88
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>at countries and rank the by GDP and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then look at their corruption indexes,</v>

89
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a tremendously high </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation and you might say,</v>

90
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty causes corruption,</v>

91
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but really that's what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

92
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say that poor people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

93
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

94
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

95
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of poor people who weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>

96
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but corrupt people are poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bloody well be sure of that.</v>

97
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.673
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

98
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 2>d a Dip.</v>

99
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

100
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

101
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Robo is falling like mad,</v>

102
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a variety of causes of that </v>

103
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 1>but is corrupt beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and corruption.</v>

105
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Corruption is like inertia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>if you and I have a transaction and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>both stick to what we say,</v>

107
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I hardly even have to think about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a sentence on a page,</v>

109
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.863
<v Speaker 1>what a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not that God only knows </v>

110
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.114
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might wipe me out because I'm </v>

111
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>trading with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:14.774
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had the business dealings with </v>

113
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people I don't even have a contract</v>

114
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just say what's going to happen?</v>

115
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And that happens and for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and then other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like detailed contracts.</v>

117
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>They take really six months of work to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out and they're violated continually</v>

118
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and it turns into just an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

119
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And so the cost of that is exceptionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

120
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.093
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a transaction that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>profitable roughly speaking in the </v>

121
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>presence of corruption because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction cost is too high.</v>

122
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.453
<v Speaker 1>And so it just spirals into poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do spend all your time trying to </v>

123
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the hell the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is up to instead of concentrating</v>

124
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:55.304
<v Speaker 1>on what you could actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the only real natural </v>

125
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty,</v>

126
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

127
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not a problem in stable</v>

129
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.003
<v Speaker 1>democratic countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best predictor of longterm success </v>

130
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>is intelligence and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

131
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.623
<v Speaker 1>isn't that an index of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that an index of the integrity of </v>

132
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>the system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how you can argue that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways.</v>

134
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people are diligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and honest.</v>

135
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>They do what they say they're gonna do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smart people are faster.</v>

136
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.013
<v Speaker 1>So basically what the data reveal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're fast while you're going </v>

137
00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:36.964
<v Speaker 1>to get there faster than other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're fast and then if you're </v>

138
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.514
<v Speaker 1>fast and honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

139
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>move up your dominance hierarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>massively,</v>

140
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 1>massively increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>the overall Rahr is probably about point</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

142
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Iq and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

143
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that's measurement error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.153
<v Speaker 1>because I can't figure out how conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are with a conscientious you are </v>

145
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 1>with a questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a lot of measurement</v>

146
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>error there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's less measurement error with Iq,</v>

147
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but then the performance indexes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also full of measurement error,</v>

148
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it isn't easy for me to tell how</v>

149
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>well you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could use estimates your income,</v>

150
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.913
<v Speaker 1>self reports of how you're doing peer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratings of how you're doing your </v>

151
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:19.454
<v Speaker 1>supervisors ratings of how you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your subordinates ratings of how you're </v>

152
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money you make.</v>

153
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're a salesman or someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a direct income,</v>

154
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.303
<v Speaker 1>but that only captures a small maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that capture 60 percent of your success </v>

155
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:33.914
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case then the are for </v>

156
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>the measurement of your success is only </v>
<v Speaker 1>about point seven five.</v>

157
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

158
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.303
<v Speaker 1>if the measurement error for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for ICU and conscientiousness tops out </v>

159
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:48.404
<v Speaker 1>at about point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probable and the performance </v>

160
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>index accuracy tops out at about point </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

161
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>a correlation of point five is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 35 percent of the variance.</v>

162
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like 70 percent of the measurable </v>
<v Speaker 1>variance.</v>

163
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and I can't think of a counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for that.</v>

165
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look in creative domains,</v>

166
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:08.634
<v Speaker 1>you have to use openness because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to use different measures </v>

167
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.910
<v Speaker 1>because creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

168
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to assess the performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of creative people.</v>

169
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v Speaker 1>If it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be creative because the </v>

170
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>problem with creative people is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep mucking with the structure that you</v>

171
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:25.240
<v Speaker 1>would use to assess them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>so you couldn't assess the castle as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionist,</v>

173
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.333
<v Speaker 1>that just isn't going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very hard for people to think </v>

174
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.973
<v Speaker 1>about what to do with someone like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle because he demands that you come </v>

175
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>up with a whole new rating scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

176
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the real problem with creative </v>

177
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

178
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

179
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.323
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about this summit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mind matters thing on Sunday </v>

180
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>because I've been thinking about power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we can segue into this.</v>

182
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:52.374
<v Speaker 1>So we already talked about how the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother emergence from chaos and so this </v>

183
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's God the father by the way,</v>

184
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:00.954
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a eastern Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation and the eastern Orthodox </v>

185
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>church split off from the Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian church in.</v>

186
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly when.</v>

187
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It was within 200 years of the 10th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

188
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>So I know that's a fairly big error and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember exactly the difference,</v>

189
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but it was way before the Protestants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Catholics split for example.</v>

190
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.143
<v Speaker 1>So it happened a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea here is that there's a </v>

191
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.284
<v Speaker 1>structure that emerges out of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that structure is symbolized by the </v>

192
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what the father represents</v>

193
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.583
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model of behavior and perception </v>

194
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that has been constructed by history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So roughly speaking,</v>

195
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 1>it's what the feminists referred to as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy.</v>

196
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.083
<v Speaker 1>Except the problem with the feminist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they only see the tyrannical element of </v>

197
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:51.594
<v Speaker 1>the Patriarchy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the reason for that is because </v>

198
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.343
<v Speaker 1>they were strongly influenced by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern philosophers of the late 19 </v>

199
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>sixties who are almost all without </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception,</v>

200
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>radical left wing student </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries who were working for the</v>

201
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 1>overthrow of the French government in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 19 sixties.</v>

202
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

203
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.483
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that the great father is only </v>

204
00:11:17.861 --> 00:11:18.910
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

205
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

206
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.963
<v Speaker 1>it's ungrateful because know you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university and I know that as a </v>

207
00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:27.250
<v Speaker 1>general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto students aren't,</v>

208
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the happiest creatures in the world and </v>

209
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>their reaction generally to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

210
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:32.614
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because the workload is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn high and the place isn't </v>

211
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:36.850
<v Speaker 1>that social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.440
<v Speaker 1>they're stressed and unhappy especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their first couple of years.</v>

213
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.603
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

214
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.203
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to say about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say the whole bloody </v>

215
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:49.100
<v Speaker 1>institution is nothing but a tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>

216
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if so,</v>

217
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

218
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:53.723
<v Speaker 1>you got to give the devil his due,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's 30 percent oppressive and </v>

219
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and 70 percent good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

220
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys think?</v>

221
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>How would you balance it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been through the university,</v>

222
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you've in your fourth year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what proportions would you suggest?</v>

223
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Thirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>

224
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.211
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:14.044
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I can tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a lot better than most </v>

226
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

227
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:19.001
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which perhaps it isn't,</v>

229
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

230
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>compared to actual institutions rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than comparing it to a utopian ideal,</v>

231
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like not too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it didn't crush you completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.523
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys are all going to graduate </v>

234
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:40.804
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually going to be of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit and there's even a possibility </v>

235
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that you know more than you did four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

236
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you haven't starved to death and all</v>

237
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>those things and everything you taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the complete or was taught.</v>

238
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't a complete lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:57.331
<v Speaker 1>so all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright it's 30 percent mandating tyrant</v>

240
00:12:58.151 --> 00:12:58.984
<v Speaker 1>and 70 percent benevolent farther and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could push that up to 80 slash </v>

241
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 1>20 or something or maybe 80 5:15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leave me,</v>

242
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:08.224
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get it past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point your attempts to </v>

243
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>make it better than that will actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it worse,</v>

244
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like in the,</v>

245
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.390
<v Speaker 1>in the old Egyptian story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of seth and it'll cyrus at horace horace</v>

246
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 1>comes along and chases seth away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just hovering around there,</v>

247
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>out in the border.</v>

248
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't get rid of them so you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>never going to get completely rid of the</v>

249
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical element of your cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>heritage.</v>

250
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.743
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because it's made out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the past and the past is dead and </v>

251
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 1>blind because for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>all the people who made it are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

253
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>it's static,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead and blind.</v>

254
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean it isn't worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing about.</v>

255
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:50.644
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job fundamentally is to revivify </v>

256
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:53.434
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I often do in this </v>

257
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it this year,</v>

258
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 1>is she'll students Pinocchio Because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

259
00:13:59.021 --> 00:13:59.854
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is a dramatic tale about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marionette whose strings are being </v>

260
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.474
<v Speaker 1>pulled by forces he doesn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming himself into an autonomous </v>

261
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.274
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a variety of things happen to </v>

262
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:11.884
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to deal with corruption in the </v>

263
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.374
<v Speaker 1>form of the criminal underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the devil himself sort of lurks </v>

264
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>behind that in the story.</v>

265
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.090
<v Speaker 1>He has to deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.023
<v Speaker 1>the temptation of eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled neuroticism because at one point </v>

267
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.163
<v Speaker 1>that criminals entice him into being </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless and lazy because he's too sick </v>

268
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:31.144
<v Speaker 1>to stand up for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he also has to go deep into </v>

269
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

270
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>into the oceanic depths to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos itself.</v>

271
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.763
<v Speaker 1>And when he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds his father who's blind and </v>

272
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>dying roughly speaking and brings them </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the surface.</v>

273
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And now he actually sacrifices himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save them.</v>

274
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the story insists that,</v>

275
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the father is drowning after the </v>

276
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 1>whales been chasing around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically says,</v>

277
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it Japan.</v>

278
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I've had it swim to shore and save </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

279
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio refuses and drags him to shore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he dies in is reborn,</v>

280
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and then poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.380
<v Speaker 1>he's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

282
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

283
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.621
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:13.454
<v Speaker 1>part of your obligation as a student is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to the university that's 15 </v>

285
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:23.291
<v Speaker 1>percent corpse or 30 percent corpse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say and make the bloody thing come</v>

286
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 1>back to life without assuming that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all tyrannical and just rejecting it,</v>

287
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.933
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very dangerous to do that </v>

288
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:31.274
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the past is corrupt and tyrannical </v>

289
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>sore you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're an embodiment of the past</v>

290
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you're enculturated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

291
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like it's outside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inside of you too.</v>

292
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing.</v>

293
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.154
<v Speaker 1>You're going to write off your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to write off your </v>

294
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:52.040
<v Speaker 1>socialization completely as nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>

295
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem.</v>

296
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.830
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>

297
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Although for some of you it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>more true than others.</v>

298
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

299
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case and you're utterly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly corrupt,</v>

300
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you think you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do about it?</v>

301
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>plus it's ungrateful and that's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake because,</v>

303
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're ungrateful you can get </v>

304
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 1>arrogant and then you're really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble and you are trouble.</v>

305
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

306
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.860
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why I made reference to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the sixties,</v>

307
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea,</v>

308
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:33.421
<v Speaker 1>then part of that was because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the Vietnam War was staggeringly</v>

309
00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:34.324
<v Speaker 1>unjust and part of that was because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were pretty tortured </v>

310
00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 1>existentially by the underground battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between communism and,</v>

311
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

312
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

313
00:16:43.421 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 1>which was breaking out all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

314
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:46.594
<v Speaker 1>including in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of underground </v>

315
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:51.424
<v Speaker 1>turmoil but part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you get to throw </v>

316
00:16:53.891 --> 00:16:56.260
<v Speaker 1>the baby out with the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

317
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 1>when Timothy leary was a good example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

318
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.190
<v Speaker 1>a turn on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the LSD tune in,</v>

319
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.520
<v Speaker 1>drop out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

320
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:08.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

321
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:10.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on,</v>

322
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 1>wake up and adopt some responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

323
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.680
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see,</v>

324
00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:19.350
<v Speaker 1>because as soon as you go to draw out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

325
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.783
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you running away or leading and </v>

326
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.670
<v Speaker 1>neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

327
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.003
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

328
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you're running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing.</v>

329
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 1>The probability that you're leading is </v>
<v Speaker 1>vanishingly small.</v>

330
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.193
<v Speaker 1>The probability that you're diluting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself about being a leader when you </v>

331
00:17:37.501 --> 00:17:38.334
<v Speaker 1>drop out is exceedingly high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right assumption is if you drop </v>

332
00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:44.460
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're useless and</v>

333
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.653
<v Speaker 1>lazy as well as arrogant and resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should start with that </v>

334
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:51.624
<v Speaker 1>presumption and then go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic soul searching to see if </v>

335
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe it might not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

336
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the probability,</v>

337
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saint or loser.</v>

338
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so few saints that you just </v>

339
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 1>use a baseline predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>actuarial tables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to assume loser.</v>

341
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

342
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>if you're a loser who thinks they're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>saint,</v>

343
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to cause an awful</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of trouble,</v>

344
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and that,</v>

345
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that happened in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

346
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.190
<v Speaker 1>the sixties generation likes to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves as admirable rebels.</v>

347
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

348
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's check a bit.</v>

349
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>For some self serving tendencies there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 1>like the refusal to adopt responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's always lurking underneath a,</v>

351
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 1>like a revolutionary facade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

352
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:46.824
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's had an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>pernicious influence on the </v>

353
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:50.304
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the humanities which are </v>

354
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.393
<v Speaker 1>dropping in enrollment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmically deteriorating in </v>

355
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:02.541
<v Speaker 1>influence and based far more on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

357
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

358
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.343
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you have a moral </v>

359
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 1>imperative to be a radical activist.</v>

360
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

361
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>you have a moral imperative to be useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honest.</v>

362
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different thing,</v>

363
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to change things like,</v>

364
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.403
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't be thinking that change isn't </v>

365
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's highly unlikely.</v>

366
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

367
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:39.360
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is there's an architectural way</v>

368
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 1>of representing the great father and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal way is tyrant or,</v>

369
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 1>or benevolent dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

370
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't get to just say one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

371
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the way you're thinking about it.</v>

372
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that once,</v>

373
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.690
<v Speaker 1>like these are archetipal and religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

374
00:19:59.691 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So you could say roughly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's God the father and God the father</v>

375
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you see there is ruling over a walled </v>
<v Speaker 1>city and the world acidity is the father</v>

376
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:08.184
<v Speaker 1>as well because it's an enclosed space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's keeping chaos out and there's a </v>

377
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:12.174
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy and everybody </v>

378
00:20:14.591 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 1>slotted in the hierarchy and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the dominance hierarchy and the</v>

379
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:20.124
<v Speaker 1>value hierarchy as the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself as the father </v>

380
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>symbolically speaking.</v>

381
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.503
<v Speaker 1>So and that you're protected by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy even though it also </v>

382
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>would presses the hell out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're like a surf,</v>

383
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe maybe it's better to be a surf</v>

384
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 1>than to be someone alone in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a battlefield.</v>

385
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly possible.</v>

386
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 1>You can make a case for that anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you look at that and you think,</v>

387
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that tyranny or security?</v>

388
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:48.101
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

389
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the ballots and what you hope</v>

390
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:50.921
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

391
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 1>let's have a little more security than </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>

392
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>And then what's your moral duty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

393
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.643
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that the great father who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not bloody well going to get rid of </v>

394
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:01.024
<v Speaker 1>and you better not because you'll end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Mesopotamians when they slap </v>

395
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 1>suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember what happened to them,</v>

396
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:06.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

397
00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Was Tiamat consort.</v>

398
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 1>He was the masculine element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos and order.</v>

399
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.643
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the ancient gods were formed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a lot of racket and they were </v>

400
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 1>really careless and they killed Appsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they lived on his corpse.</v>

401
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 1>While that's not a very good idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then time,</v>

402
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.640
<v Speaker 1>outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.553
<v Speaker 1>swarming back and the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to do you in with all her </v>

404
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:28.324
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you really pay attention and </v>

405
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 1>speak properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>

406
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

407
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians had that figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they and they had it figured out an</v>

408
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:38.530
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely remarkable,</v>

409
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 1>a remarkable story.</v>

410
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.570
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>

411
00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two questions in there.</v>

412
00:22:06.711 --> 00:22:09.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the ones where sometimes it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a lot of both.</v>

413
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what happens when you </v>

414
00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:14.360
<v Speaker 1>were subjected to extraordinarily high </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

415
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that order chaos?</v>

416
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both,</v>

417
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's massive benefits in high</v>

418
00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:22.310
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

419
00:22:22.311 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 1>is they provoke anxiety and they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to attain.</v>

420
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.873
<v Speaker 1>Does that make them bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no saying it makes them bad end </v>

421
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:31.694
<v Speaker 1>good and it's even more complex than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because whether they're bad or </v>

422
00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:36.490
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on how you react to their,</v>

423
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.333
<v Speaker 1>their imposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you discipline yourself and </v>

424
00:22:40.731 --> 00:22:41.564
<v Speaker 1>straighten yourself up and learn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount and achieve the high </v>

425
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:45.564
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way better for you than if this </v>

426
00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:51.740
<v Speaker 1>high standards weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also going to crush people.</v>

427
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.813
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to crush people for all </v>

428
00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:54.164
<v Speaker 1>sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be really hard on </v>

429
00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:57.860
<v Speaker 1>people who just aren't that fast.</v>

430
00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.693
<v Speaker 1>Even if they work really hard or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be really hard on people who </v>

431
00:23:01.341 --> 00:23:03.590
<v Speaker 1>are quite fast but really don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard,</v>

432
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.720
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be hard on people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.310
<v Speaker 1>have impediments to progress in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one unfair way or another.</v>

434
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.340
<v Speaker 1>So the tyrannical element is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

435
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole bloody thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerates into tyranny when the people</v>

437
00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 1>inside it are doing nothing but lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pathway to tyranny,</v>

438
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

439
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmark of the adversarial personality.</v>

440
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about the great mother </v>

441
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.710
<v Speaker 1>creation and destruction and the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father Tierney and security,</v>

442
00:23:36.711 --> 00:23:37.544
<v Speaker 1>but on top of that is the individual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the part of the individual </v>

443
00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:43.310
<v Speaker 1>that's heroic and I would say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

444
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.383
<v Speaker 1>attentive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and capable and willing to articulate </v>

445
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the truth in so far as that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized.</v>

446
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.293
<v Speaker 1>And then his polar opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite of that willfully </v>

447
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 1>blind and deceitful at every possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

448
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly an interaction between</v>

449
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 1>all three of those levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

450
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.343
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity was that the serpent that </v>

452
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 1>was in the garden got associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan.</v>

453
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.240
<v Speaker 1>That's very weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

454
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.173
<v Speaker 1>it's very unlikely when that story first</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged that the serpent had any </v>

455
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 1>association with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary at all.</v>

456
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.583
<v Speaker 1>But as the story developed through time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was if you construe the </v>

457
00:24:31.021 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 1>serpent as chaos itself and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative element of chaos,</v>

458
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to associate that with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical father.</v>

459
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.760
<v Speaker 1>So there'd be a botanical element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the adversary himself,</v>

460
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all negative.</v>

461
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:46.124
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the connection between the three </v>

462
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:48.644
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it took western culture roughly </v>

463
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>speaking thousands of years to delineate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

464
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably didn't come to its full </v>

465
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:57.524
<v Speaker 1>poetic flowering until Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very little of it is in the </v>

466
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Bible as it's as it as it currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands,</v>

467
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 1>virtually nothing.</v>

468
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.733
<v Speaker 1>That's one translation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer's also the bringer of light </v>

469
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.320
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

470
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

471
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

472
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wild.</v>

473
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of these paradoxical situations</v>

474
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:26.561
<v Speaker 1>because it's also not always the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your adversary is the devil,</v>

475
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be an angel in disguise,</v>

476
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:30.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's young's notion with regards </v>

477
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>to the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think that it's evil,</v>

478
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.033
<v Speaker 1>but it might be the thing you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>need now lurking underneath that is the </v>

479
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 1>idea that there is absolute good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute evil and I think you can make a</v>

480
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 1>case for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

481
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I think the 20th century made a case for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I think that's what was decided</v>

482
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:50.804
<v Speaker 1>at the Nuremberg trials after World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>Two because the judicial decision was </v>

483
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.533
<v Speaker 1>there are some things you don't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do no matter what your culture is like </v>

484
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what your excuse is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.963
<v Speaker 1>and the alternative that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was deciding where we can let you </v>

486
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 1>off the hook because you were following </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders,</v>

487
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people really debated that and you </v>

488
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:12.494
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the Nuremberg judges were the </v>

489
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>allied victors and so they just imposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own viewpoint.</v>

490
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.523
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's pretty damn cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was probably some of that because </v>

491
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>things are tyrannical and benevolent at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

492
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.124
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting that judgment is a very </v>

493
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>peculiar metaphysical move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But rejecting it,</v>

494
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>that's also a very peculiar metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

495
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically what you say if you,</v>

496
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.343
<v Speaker 1>if you reject the Nuremberg decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what happened in Nazi </v>

497
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.873
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps was had to be judged</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the lands of cultural </v>

498
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:52.610
<v Speaker 1>relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can say that if you want,</v>

499
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:53.444
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not one of those things that you </v>

500
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>should do lightly because,</v>

501
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into Dostoyevsky's problem.</v>

502
00:27:01.611 --> 00:27:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky's problem fundamentally is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no order,</v>

503
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical order.</v>

504
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.380
<v Speaker 1>If there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything is permitted and you can</v>

505
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:14.381
<v Speaker 1>walk down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't lead to very good place.</v>

506
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

507
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.110
<v Speaker 1>so you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're,</v>

508
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.400
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to sort out is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

509
00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:24.110
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to propose the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

510
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.303
<v Speaker 1>what myths are doing is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the fundamental elements of </v>

511
00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:33.860
<v Speaker 1>being as being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as experienced at every level of being.</v>

512
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:39.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a reduction to chemical or </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical constituent elements.</v>

513
00:27:39.081 --> 00:27:39.914
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perception of the world as it </v>

514
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:47.750
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself at every level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence simultaneously.</v>

515
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.853
<v Speaker 1>And it's predicated on the proposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no reason to make any one </v>

516
00:27:52.311 --> 00:27:57.200
<v Speaker 1>of those levels primary from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ontological perspective.</v>

517
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.273
<v Speaker 1>So what that would mean in part is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the web of relationships that you find </v>

518
00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:06.941
<v Speaker 1>yourself in is just as real as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological components of yourselves.</v>

519
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.343
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously in some sense it can't be </v>

520
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:13.400
<v Speaker 1>measured or even conceptualized in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way,</v>

521
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.900
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the relationship isn't real,</v>

522
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

523
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:20.503
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more comprehensive way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things and it tends to take </v>

524
00:28:24.531 --> 00:28:27.410
<v Speaker 1>on this dramatic and imagistic for Mei </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because,</v>

525
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

526
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it was acted out before it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

527
00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:35.921
<v Speaker 1>And second images can capture all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that words cannot yet express,</v>

528
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.720
<v Speaker 1>which is why we liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we liked looking at,</v>

529
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound artistic images.</v>

530
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>They're filling us with information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

531
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.390
<v Speaker 1>what I found out recently that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger,</v>

532
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:48.583
<v Speaker 1>whose ideas actually have a fair number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of similarities with what I've been </v>

533
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>teaching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

534
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 1>except I'll tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting there that I think is true.</v>

535
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger tended to view modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

536
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.003
<v Speaker 1>He tended to view it as the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the great father stopping us </v>

537
00:29:08.391 --> 00:29:10.640
<v Speaker 1>from being able to interact with pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

538
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.283
<v Speaker 1>So he was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His proposition was that we reconnect </v>

539
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:30.521
<v Speaker 1>ourselves with the positive element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and produce our producer culture,</v>

540
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.090
<v Speaker 1>social culture that was much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent.</v>

541
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you think about</v>

542
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 3>this from a union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Union's claim,</v>

543
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:45.604
<v Speaker 3>and this is an Alfred Adler claimed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing and so did need you to some </v>

544
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 3>degree is if you tilt too far in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>

545
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.963
<v Speaker 3>a counter position develops in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and starts to have an </v>

546
00:29:57.191 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 3>uncanny influence on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can give you an example.</v>

547
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 3>So I've had clients for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are way too agreeable,</v>

548
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe they're pushed around by their </v>

549
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:07.774
<v Speaker 3>father for decades and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways they react to the hyper </v>

550
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 3>aggression of their father or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance of their father or maybe their</v>

551
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:16.294
<v Speaker 3>own weaknesses that they classify </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance and aggression as evil and </v>

552
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:21.904
<v Speaker 3>then refuse to engage in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course that just weakens them </v>

553
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they harbor resentment,</v>

554
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.263
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things you suggest is </v>

555
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 3>that if you get gripped by an emotion </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>

556
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 3>you need to let it manifest itself in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy,</v>

557
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've had my clients tell me </v>

558
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 3>fantasies once they've learned to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>the manifest themselves,</v>

559
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll be irritated,</v>

560
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by something their father says,</v>

561
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 3>and they'll let the fantasy play out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

562
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 3>not only is it murderous like you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>not believe,</v>

563
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's viciously and violently </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous,</v>

564
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

565
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.703
<v Speaker 3>what happens there is that because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little issues that constitute the </v>

566
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical element of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between them are never dealt with.</v>

567
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.210
<v Speaker 3>The part of them that is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up and,</v>

568
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.083
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pushing forward has been assaulted </v>

569
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 3>by a million blows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so.</v>

570
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.043
<v Speaker 1>It's been pushed into such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologically defensive position by </v>

571
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that point that it doesn't fantasize </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

572
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:34.973
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should have a chat with my dad </v>

573
00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:37.170
<v Speaker 1>and settled this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

574
00:31:37.171 --> 00:31:37.621
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

575
00:31:37.621 --> 00:31:38.454
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like full fledged murderous </v>

576
00:31:39.361 --> 00:31:41.730
<v Speaker 1>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that time,</v>

577
00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:44.850
<v Speaker 1>the person is also terrified even to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fantasy emerge.</v>

578
00:31:44.851 --> 00:31:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Because then they'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

579
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:47.124
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I some kind of serial killer or </v>

580
00:31:48.181 --> 00:31:51.050
<v Speaker 1>some kind of homicidal maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

581
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.010
<v Speaker 1>the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

582
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.180
<v Speaker 1>of course you're partly all I'm a cidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>maniac,</v>

583
00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:55.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to keep that stuff under </v>

584
00:31:56.071 --> 00:31:56.904
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so otherwise you take it out on your </v>

585
00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:01.110
<v Speaker 1>children and the people that love you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

586
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>But that's not so bad if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

587
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.060
<v Speaker 1>manifest in day to day trivialities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of keep things sorted out.</v>

588
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:11.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do anything about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 20 years,</v>

589
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.233
<v Speaker 1>you always hear about these guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst forth and do something ultra </v>

590
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>violent.</v>

591
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.733
<v Speaker 1>What are the neighbors always say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're the lone killer </v>

592
00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:20.220
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

593
00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:22.350
<v Speaker 1>he was such a nice boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

594
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.540
<v Speaker 1>we never saw many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never caused any trouble.</v>

595
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.351
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

596
00:32:25.351 --> 00:32:27.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never caused enough trouble.</v>

597
00:32:27.751 --> 00:32:28.584
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he sure made up for it in one fell </v>

598
00:32:30.451 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 1>swoop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

599
00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 1>back to heidegger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger had this.</v>

600
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger seemed to have this vision of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy,</v>

601
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as hyper dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then valued the opposite,</v>

602
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:48.880
<v Speaker 1>which was more cooperative and more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tune with nature and you know,</v>

603
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.920
<v Speaker 1>sort of like an environmentalists dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what human society should be like.</v>

604
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.193
<v Speaker 1>And I say that seriously because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe a lot of what the modern </v>

605
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:04.751
<v Speaker 1>environmental movement uses to dry this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's utopian visions is actually derived</v>

606
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 1>directly from heidegger's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

607
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you can trace the causal pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got think,</v>

608
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>remember what happened to heidegger </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

609
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 1>He became a Nazi,</v>

610
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was a real shock to everyone who</v>

611
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>is a high tech area and follower because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only seemed like such a good guy.</v>

612
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

613
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he was too good a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

614
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And so there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was all sweetness and light,</v>

615
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:31.454
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the sort of patriarchal end of the </v>

616
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.033
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the counterbalance to that </v>

617
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:39.560
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself politically and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pulled right in.</v>

618
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.903
<v Speaker 1>So I think one of the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between what I'm proposing and what </v>

619
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 1>heidegger proposed is that like I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>never say that,</v>

620
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 1>that there's a utopian solution to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of the great father.</v>

621
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and the negative.</v>

622
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

623
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.163
<v Speaker 1>I think through diligent effort you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the positive on top of the </v>

624
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:04.004
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do that by sacrificing </v>

625
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

626
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't get rid of tyranny by </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakening society.</v>

627
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.093
<v Speaker 1>All you do then is you increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that when tyranny bursts </v>

628
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:18.080
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be far more brutal than it</v>

629
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 1>would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

630
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.643
<v Speaker 1>you increase the benevolent element of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of society by increasing its competence </v>

631
00:34:27.911 --> 00:34:31.270
<v Speaker 1>and power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make it more powerful,</v>

632
00:34:31.271 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>not less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean more.</v>

633
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.560
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean more oppressive,</v>

634
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:50.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

635
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

636
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's problem.</v>

637
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.300
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things Solzhenitsyn wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about was he was in prison in the prison</v>

638
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:08.134
<v Speaker 1>camps in Russia for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he used to </v>

639
00:35:13.181 --> 00:35:14.014
<v Speaker 1>amuse himself within the darkest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way with his compatriots was </v>

640
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:19.660
<v Speaker 1>teasing communists once they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested,</v>

641
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was pretty brutal because once </v>

642
00:35:24.551 --> 00:35:25.384
<v Speaker 1>you were thrown into the gulag system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you were going to </v>

643
00:35:27.491 --> 00:35:28.324
<v Speaker 1>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you were a political </v>

644
00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:29.711
<v Speaker 1>prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

645
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you're in there for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:35:31.631 --> 00:35:32.464
<v Speaker 1>and you're lucky if you didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked to death and the thugs and the </v>

647
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.090
<v Speaker 1>murderers and the thieves didn't beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>you senseless constantly.</v>

648
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.063
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing left of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was no joke to be thrown into </v>

649
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 1>ghoulag if you were a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoner.</v>

650
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And there were lots of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown in there purely arbitrarily.</v>

651
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to punish someone,</v>

652
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you punish them because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit any crime.</v>

653
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:52.584
<v Speaker 1>That's a way better punishment than </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing them if they actually </v>

654
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:56.240
<v Speaker 1>committed the crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.083
<v Speaker 1>because that's just justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But random punishment if you want to be </v>

656
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one to use.</v>

657
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 1>So the communists would get thrown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the prisoners,</v>

658
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:07.980
<v Speaker 1>had been in there for awhile and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>still be like rampant communists.</v>

659
00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:08.814
<v Speaker 1>They'd be writing letters to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to extricate themselves from </v>

660
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the situation assuming that a mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been made,</v>

661
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those units and his compatriots </v>

662
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:21.150
<v Speaker 1>would just tease the hell out of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had nothing left to lose.</v>

663
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Plus they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

664
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.383
<v Speaker 1>you're still part of the God system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually imprisoned and brutalized </v>

665
00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself and us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of Social Lipson's moral problem</v>

666
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>with what should I do with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like should I feel sorry for you because</v>

667
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.780
<v Speaker 1>you've fallen into this absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>hellish category of that person betrayed</v>

668
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.400
<v Speaker 1>by their own ideals and their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

669
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 1>or should I treat you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you right?</v>

670
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Because you're blind tyrant and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've produced.</v>

671
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And Solzhenitsyn's answer was you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind tyrant until you repent.</v>

672
00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you still think you're </v>

673
00:37:00.911 --> 00:37:01.744
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

674
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.130
<v Speaker 1>there is no possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

675
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So then what he observed was some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would collapse,</v>

676
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.670
<v Speaker 1>they admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it took a long time that maybe</v>

677
00:37:15.671 --> 00:37:16.504
<v Speaker 1>there was something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and that the other people in </v>

678
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:23.080
<v Speaker 1>there weren't all the guilty ones in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

679
00:37:23.081 --> 00:37:23.914
<v Speaker 1>the only innocent ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people would accept the facts </v>

680
00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.114
<v Speaker 1>even at whatever brutal costs that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be and what that would be was starting </v>

681
00:37:34.271 --> 00:37:35.104
<v Speaker 1>to decompose the entire value system </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had that was predicated on </v>

682
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.950
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic communists belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other ones,</v>

683
00:37:41.951 --> 00:37:44.680
<v Speaker 1>and these are the ones that social </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance also writes about,</v>

684
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.610
<v Speaker 1>they just never changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:50.110
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years later they'd say,</v>

686
00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:50.944
<v Speaker 1>well that just proves the system was </v>
<v Speaker 1>right all along and that I was an error </v>

687
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:54.851
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:37:54.851 --> 00:37:59.851
<v Speaker 1>you can always interpret the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The data does not speak for itself.</v>

689
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

690
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.813
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

691
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So I thought his solution was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

692
00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with someone who still </v>

693
00:38:10.761 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 1>acting out what has destroyed them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

694
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.553
<v Speaker 1>until they stopped being part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really forgive them or </v>

695
00:38:20.001 --> 00:38:23.000
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they drop it,</v>

696
00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you give them a hand,</v>

697
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.443
<v Speaker 1>which seems to me like a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between justice and forgiveness </v>

698
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very hard balance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike,</v>

699
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very hard balance to so okay.</v>

700
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.393
<v Speaker 1>So then I kind of differentiated this </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the tyrant is the king that eats </v>

701
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:44.644
<v Speaker 1>his own son roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that like if you have a </v>

702
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.310
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical father say in your actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

703
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.353
<v Speaker 1>what that father is going to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>react to everything that makes you </v>

704
00:38:55.691 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 1>independent or that could make you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent being as if it's a challenge</v>

705
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 1>to his own authority and dominance.</v>

706
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.063
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever you stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and make your little thrust </v>

707
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Speaker 1>forward like you would if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old,</v>

708
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to get whacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard for it.</v>

709
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:14.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get punished for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that would allow you to climb</v>

710
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hurricane to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenger.</v>

711
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.303
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the paternal element of </v>

712
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

713
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.400
<v Speaker 1>mother who demands nothing and father </v>
<v Speaker 1>who punishes everything good.</v>

714
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.323
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to raise someone who's </v>

715
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.183
<v Speaker 1>completely demolished and also in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high probability resentful and </v>

716
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and you know,</v>

717
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:46.750
<v Speaker 1>you have societies like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.584
<v Speaker 1>you see this in corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what especially when they start to </v>

719
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:50.164
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate as they start to punish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people inside the corporation for being </v>

720
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:54.064
<v Speaker 1>hardworking and creative and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is in real trouble at that </v>

721
00:39:56.951 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

722
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.090
<v Speaker 1>It's basically dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might take 10 years to fall over,</v>

723
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

724
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as corporations,</v>

725
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:06.634
<v Speaker 1>as hierarchical structures get full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are doing nothing but trying </v>

726
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.150
<v Speaker 1>to climb the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.993
<v Speaker 1>their power motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very annoyed at anyone who's </v>

728
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:16.534
<v Speaker 1>competent and creative because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent and creative people are using </v>

729
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 1>competence and creativity declined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

730
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Whereas they're just using political </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinations and the desire for power.</v>

731
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.633
<v Speaker 1>So they want nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to have those people </v>

732
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 1>around because all they are is </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors and they're not even that.</v>

733
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They don't even actually care if while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're climbing the ladder on the ship,</v>

734
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the thing is sinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be facilitating.</v>

736
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:42.934
<v Speaker 1>It's sinking in trying to pirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they possibly can while the </v>

737
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 1>thing falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it happens all the time.</v>

738
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So when it happens in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

739
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.953
<v Speaker 1>so that sort of the sun eating farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation in a political or </v>

740
00:40:58.391 --> 00:41:00.810
<v Speaker 1>corporate institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when it sorta.</v>

741
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.653
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that both the Liberals and the </v>

742
00:41:04.721 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>conservatives see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

743
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>they say the left wingers and the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wingers,</v>

744
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:09.683
<v Speaker 1>the left wingers see the tie radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the great father in </v>

745
00:41:12.811 --> 00:41:13.644
<v Speaker 1>corporations and the right wingers see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tie radical element of the great </v>

746
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 1>father in the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's projection,</v>

747
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

748
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.063
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me like a radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification to assume that all </v>

749
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.553
<v Speaker 1>the evil is embodied in the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>or all the evil is embodied in </v>

750
00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:28.540
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

751
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:29.374
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be a little more </v>

752
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:30.454
<v Speaker 1>differentiated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all corporations are not the same </v>

753
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.633
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all governments are clearly not the </v>

754
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:38.024
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all governmental policies are </v>

755
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 1>clearly not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are lazy.</v>

756
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 1>So they don't want to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation.</v>

757
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:43.994
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal representations possess them </v>

758
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 1>initially and they failed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate them,</v>

759
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're pretty happy about that </v>

760
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 1>because their theory explains </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

761
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

762
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.103
<v Speaker 1>I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a guy a while back and he's </v>

763
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 1>a pretty smart guy and I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this issue of corruption.</v>

764
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

765
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.493
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did some countries get not </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt because I cannot figure that </v>

766
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot understand how that can even be</v>

767
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that's a massive mystery.</v>

768
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I can imagine digging through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 30 years,</v>

769
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he answered in two seconds.</v>

770
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:22.491
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

771
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

772
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is,</v>

773
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to think about that.</v>

774
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And so here's my one word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low resolution answer that covers 50,000</v>

775
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>snakes at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful,</v>

776
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

777
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:40.424
<v Speaker 1>all it does is convince them that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>possesses knowledge because he's using </v>

778
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:46.004
<v Speaker 1>low representation representations to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompass huge swaths of the complex </v>

779
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

780
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:52.094
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

781
00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then punish them.</v>

782
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that is exactly so,</v>

783
00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:15.560
<v Speaker 1>so the reference there is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

784
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 1>people have tried to model optimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions,</v>

785
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:19.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so should we cooperate or should we </v>

786
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>fight and so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who tried to model that,</v>

787
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it in one offs so it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a case that</v>

788
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

789
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 1>if there's $20 at stake and I could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20 by like giving you a zero,</v>

790
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I should do that if I'm only going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with you once.</v>

791
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.823
<v Speaker 1>And so the initial experiments basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that if you are a psychopath </v>

792
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you'd win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then someone figured out that,</v>

793
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.803
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever do anything once you </v>

794
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 1>iterate it and that's a phd an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

795
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.923
<v Speaker 1>Because Piaget would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the stable solution across </v>

796
00:43:58.731 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>multiple iterations of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

797
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:05.180
<v Speaker 1>well what if we always cooperate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A group of us,</v>

798
00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:07.490
<v Speaker 1>we always cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a problem with that because</v>

799
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:12.080
<v Speaker 1>then psychopath a pop up randomly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a shark in a tank of guppies.</v>

800
00:44:12.081 --> 00:44:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He just eats all the guppies and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of this situation.</v>

801
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:19.240
<v Speaker 1>So if all we do is cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's noncooperative Canadian,</v>

802
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>any immediately get everything we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then the problem becomes,</v>

803
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.283
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to take full of sharks </v>

804
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want a tank full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guppies.</v>

805
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 1>What should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer,</v>

806
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 1>because this has been played out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer simulations by the way all over</v>

807
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.391
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is well,</v>

808
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 1>how do you ensure stability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something like,</v>

809
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start with the presumption that you're</v>

810
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy if you react in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy manner.</v>

811
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Away we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we trade and it's transparent.</v>

812
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 1>If you screw me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I whack you,</v>

813
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and then I offered a trade with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

814
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.673
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be now that's really </v>

815
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 1>worth thinking about because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow idea in there,</v>

816
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I trust you,</v>

817
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 1>but if you bother me all bite you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bite you hard,</v>

818
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but then we can trade again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't that.</v>

819
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 1>What that allows is that you can screw </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

820
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will.</v>

821
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So it means that we can continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

822
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:17.904
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get punished and </v>

823
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 1>appropriate amount if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

824
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll try to get the game going</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

825
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that's an example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pig and celebrated solution,</v>

826
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:30.650
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could ease,</v>

827
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:31.503
<v Speaker 1>it could be that that does have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with the way that a </v>

828
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:34.644
<v Speaker 1>culture learns to become non-corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't explain how that </v>

829
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:40.820
<v Speaker 1>gets implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

830
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

831
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a walled city,</v>

832
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

833
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place exists that's in France.</v>

834
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 1>And fortunately I can't remember the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of it at the moment.</v>

835
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.740
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best preserved medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities in the world.</v>

836
00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually quite a few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those left in Europe.</v>

837
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>staggeringly beautiful,</v>

838
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

839
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but you see how those things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed a,</v>

840
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 1>because there's a double wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

841
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And so you think about what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological message that's embodied in</v>

842
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:12.414
<v Speaker 1>that city and the messages inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls where there's a civilized </v>

843
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're safe from barbarians.</v>

844
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And chaos and the barbarians and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>surround that.</v>

845
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And so it's better to be inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

846
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously the problem is the city's </v>
<v Speaker 1>walled,</v>

847
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's not that easy to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trapped in there,</v>

848
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way.</v>

849
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.813
<v Speaker 1>So you could see while you could find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine if you're a teenager and a </v>

850
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:41.820
<v Speaker 1>medieval city like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 12 years old or 13 years old,</v>

851
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:42.654
<v Speaker 1>you're off with your ratty little </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies and the first thing you want to </v>

852
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.710
<v Speaker 1>do is go outside the wall and see what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

853
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there weren't any walls,</v>

854
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:50.574
<v Speaker 1>well then the barbarians would come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd steal everything you had and </v>

855
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone would be dead and that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be a good thing.</v>

856
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.491
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:57.324
<v Speaker 1>it was also a place to store prod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use our agricultural produce so that it </v>

858
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:01.914
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't rot and wouldn't get eaten by </v>

859
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:06.000
<v Speaker 1>bugs and wouldn't be stolen by thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

860
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:06.834
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was also extraordinarily </v>

861
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:08.964
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a belief system embedded </v>

862
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:12.710
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

863
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:13.723
<v Speaker 1>that would be the medieval world order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as well as there being a belief </v>

864
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 1>system and a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

865
00:47:19.891 --> 00:47:24.891
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a physical structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a mode of relationship and all</v>

866
00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>of that together constitutes the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

867
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:28.584
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the belief and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be tyrannical because </v>

868
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a king and some of it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be beneficial because,</v>

869
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.650
<v Speaker 1>well maybe better to have one king than </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 kings.</v>

870
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:39.484
<v Speaker 1>They're having a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been the dilemma in American </v>

871
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

872
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:46.774
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give American football foreign </v>

873
00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some credit,</v>

874
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>

875
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>which is a reasonable thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because part of the,</v>

876
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.840
<v Speaker 1>what are the Americans we're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out,</v>

877
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 1>especially since the end of the World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War World War was,</v>

878
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 1>is it better to have a tyrant</v>

879
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 1>or take them out and have 30 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:12.720
<v Speaker 1>announcer to that is who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:17.100
<v Speaker 1>so they took the tire and out of Iraq,</v>

882
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.843
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

883
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country basically fractured and it </v>

884
00:48:24.991 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 1>happens very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

885
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.173
<v Speaker 1>it's a failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get little fiefdoms of war lords </v>

886
00:48:30.361 --> 00:48:31.194
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are certainly no improvement over </v>

887
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the original tyrant and they tear the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place apart.</v>

888
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not making a case for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of a tyrant,</v>

889
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.613
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

890
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.523
<v Speaker 1>But the opposite of order is chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos can be just as destructive as </v>

891
00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:49.950
<v Speaker 1>tyranny or maybe it can be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive.</v>

892
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.383
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happened to some degree </v>

893
00:48:53.041 --> 00:48:54.600
<v Speaker 1>with the Arab spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

894
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

895
00:48:55.501 --> 00:48:57.180
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody thinks,</v>

896
00:48:57.181 --> 00:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>well this is a chance for a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and you know,</v>

897
00:48:59.731 --> 00:49:03.420
<v Speaker 1>it seems like in places like Tunisia </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually worked,</v>

898
00:49:03.421 --> 00:49:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and then the things loosened up a bit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morocco too.</v>

899
00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So there was some indication of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

900
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Speaker 1>But in places like Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

901
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:13.074
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like it's degenerating into </v>

902
00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:14.964
<v Speaker 1>complete hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see the same thing in many </v>

903
00:49:16.561 --> 00:49:19.050
<v Speaker 1>places in the Middle East where the Arab</v>
<v Speaker 1>spring occurred.</v>

904
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.573
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

905
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.533
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also why it's so necessary to </v>

906
00:49:25.231 --> 00:49:29.730
<v Speaker 1>understand what lurks behind tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what lurks behind tyranny is not</v>

907
00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:30.564
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos and Harris has the potential </v>

908
00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:34.734
<v Speaker 1>for freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it depends on what people do </v>

909
00:49:36.301 --> 00:49:38.430
<v Speaker 1>with the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

910
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:39.383
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident that the chaos is </v>

911
00:49:41.191 --> 00:49:42.024
<v Speaker 1>better than the tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

912
00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:48.270
<v Speaker 1>in every society there are agents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and there are people.</v>

913
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:53.330
<v Speaker 1>They're often at relatively low strata </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dominant Turkey.</v>

914
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.070
<v Speaker 1>They're usually young men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're usually extremely aggressive.</v>

915
00:49:56.071 --> 00:49:56.904
<v Speaker 1>They're usually incredibly resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>displaced and for them as soon as chaos </v>

916
00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:03.630
<v Speaker 1>appears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's open season.</v>

917
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that struck,</v>

918
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:08.910
<v Speaker 1>the society has been restructured and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can just go about taking everything</v>

919
00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:12.710
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

920
00:50:12.711 --> 00:50:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you see that even in countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada where those are the guys who riot</v>

921
00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:17.630
<v Speaker 1>after a hockey game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:50:17.631 --> 00:50:18.464
<v Speaker 1>they need no excuse whatsoever to go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos and act like absolute </v>

923
00:50:22.941 --> 00:50:27.941
<v Speaker 1>barbarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

924
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.273
<v Speaker 2>Security.</v>

925
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

926
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

927
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a causal interrelationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

928
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:39.284
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole chapter on that near in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last third of maps of meaning </v>

929
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 1>describes the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two halves of the adversary.</v>

930
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a nihilistic element and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascistic element,</v>

931
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:51.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once the value hierarchy falls </v>

932
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:55.604
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one response is let's go in there and </v>

933
00:50:58.911 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 1>get up the golden rebuild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

934
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:01.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that would be the heroic </v>

935
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the adversarial element is,</v>

936
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's falling apart.</v>

937
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:13.930
<v Speaker 1>It's every man for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fascistic element would be me,</v>

938
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to exert power not for </v>

939
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 1>competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>

940
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 1>pure dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like rape and pillage.</v>

941
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

942
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

943
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.153
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you contrast that with utter </v>

944
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:34.543
<v Speaker 1>powerlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how rape and pillage might </v>

945
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 1>be attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

946
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:43.490
<v Speaker 1>that's also why I think it's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often too young men at the bottom of the</v>

947
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:45.500
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed.</v>

948
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we know is that if you</v>

949
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:49.874
<v Speaker 1>have a fairly flat dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that opportunity is distributed and </v>

950
00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting from the bottom to the top.</v>

951
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So you have hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

952
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Then the males at the bottom don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>very aggressive,</v>

953
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you get the damn thing pointed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that there's almost no possibility of</v>

954
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.970
<v Speaker 1>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you use competence,</v>

955
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:12.343
<v Speaker 1>then the males at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that are </v>

956
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they would be more warrior types.</v>

957
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get aggressive right away and there</v>

958
00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 1>are there gangs.</v>

959
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 1>They dominate the gangs and they go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>war with each other,</v>

960
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.433
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful gang members are far more </v>

961
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:29.504
<v Speaker 1>successful as successful gang members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they would be successful as low </v>

962
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:38.210
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly paid conformists.</v>

963
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Now most of the guys in the gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse off actually,</v>

964
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:42.824
<v Speaker 1>so some of the best dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological evidence that's been </v>

965
00:52:44.691 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 1>collected suggest that most people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug ring.</v>

966
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.003
<v Speaker 1>So there are the people at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>make less than they would if they were </v>

967
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>working for minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lottery.</v>

968
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly the violence helps because that </v>

969
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.220
<v Speaker 1>top of the dam hierarchies being peeled </v>
<v Speaker 1>off by deaths all the time.</v>

970
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pop yourself up three or</v>

971
00:53:04.971 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 1>four levels and then you'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>riotous old time for the next five years</v>

972
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:09.764
<v Speaker 1>till you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a lot better than having </v>

973
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 1>a chaotic existence with nothing for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next five years until you die.</v>

974
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.513
<v Speaker 1>part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what society is always have to </v>

976
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:25.230
<v Speaker 1>do is to make sure the damn dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy doesn't get so steep and climb</v>

977
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.073
<v Speaker 1>a bowl that all the ordinary men at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom start to get hypervisor is well </v>

978
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 1>documented and the best work on that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>done at mcmaster.</v>

979
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:35.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

980
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:37.973
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never remember the people who did </v>

981
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:40.060
<v Speaker 1>the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

982
00:53:40.061 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I can never remember their name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me.</v>

983
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.983
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

984
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:44.023
<v Speaker 2>So then I guess the best strategy then </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided later to assess the potential </v>

985
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.863
<v Speaker 2>payoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The manifest for her as opposed to the </v>

986
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.253
<v Speaker 2>APP.</v>

987
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:03.381
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

988
00:54:03.381 --> 00:54:04.214
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people generally don't do that </v>

989
00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:06.260
<v Speaker 1>calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

990
00:54:06.261 --> 00:54:08.630
<v Speaker 1>remember when the Americans went into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

991
00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:09.883
<v Speaker 1>what did they think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the theory will be welcomed as </v>

992
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:15.320
<v Speaker 1>liberator's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.240
<v Speaker 1>that was actually true in some cases for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a week,</v>

994
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was they wiped out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power structure.</v>

995
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:27.560
<v Speaker 1>They dismantled the army and you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

996
00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but then what the hell are all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers going to do their soldiers.</v>

997
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.160
<v Speaker 1>They know where the weapons are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just going to sit around,</v>

998
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:37.760
<v Speaker 1>especially not the hyper aggressive guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are already soldiers.</v>

999
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 1>They're going to think to hell with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1000
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:40.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos and I'm going to get what I </v>

1001
00:54:42.381 --> 00:54:44.420
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting when,</v>

1002
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:49.280
<v Speaker 1>when I saw that happening because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>went and wiped out so damn,</v>

1003
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:50.503
<v Speaker 1>and then there was all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing computers and things from the </v>

1004
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.390
<v Speaker 1>government offices and the western media</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept saying looting,</v>

1005
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:58.040
<v Speaker 1>looting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

1006
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not looting.</v>

1007
00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:04.100
<v Speaker 1>You just wiped out the legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no legal system anymore.</v>

1008
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not looting because that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the law.</v>

1009
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just wiped it out.</v>

1010
00:55:09.711 --> 00:55:11.840
<v Speaker 1>He was a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>

1011
00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:12.674
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people should have followed the </v>

1012
00:55:13.341 --> 00:55:14.780
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was there.</v>

1013
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.823
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you wouldn't have gone into that </v>

1014
00:55:18.051 --> 00:55:18.884
<v Speaker 1>country if it was true because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would only be true if the law was just </v>

1015
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.443
<v Speaker 1>because if it wasn't just then why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell should people are bad and if you'd </v>

1016
00:55:26.331 --> 00:55:30.860
<v Speaker 1>been tyrannized by people for 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could take a computer.</v>

1017
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say that isn't exactly what you</v>

1018
00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:35.330
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

1019
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.193
<v Speaker 1>the West acted like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually natural law governs this </v>

1020
00:55:39.801 --> 00:55:43.070
<v Speaker 1>and Hussein is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call an anomaly,</v>

1021
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.083
<v Speaker 1>and so you take him out and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural law and you should follow it </v>

1022
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.543
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looting is no looting when there's no </v>

1023
00:55:49.761 --> 00:55:50.594
<v Speaker 1>law</v>

1024
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:54.603
<v Speaker 2>like for when of like voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself rather than letting the world </v>

1025
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>presented your doorstep and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1026
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's kind of exemplified in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

1027
00:56:10.721 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 2>like you have to do it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer,</v>

1028
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.283
<v Speaker 2>that you'll do it in a way that like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you care about yourself and </v>

1029
00:56:19.061 --> 00:56:21.420
<v Speaker 2>you want to have to integrate these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things later.</v>

1030
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.510
<v Speaker 2>You just say your own dictator.</v>

1031
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.680
<v Speaker 3>You can take the care to reintegrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1032
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.440
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

1033
00:56:31.441 --> 00:56:32.274
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1034
00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:36.923
<v Speaker 1>well they almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also might blow it apart at such a </v>

1035
00:56:38.881 --> 00:56:42.960
<v Speaker 1>high level in the hierarchy that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bloody way you're going to be able to</v>

1036
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.440
<v Speaker 1>bite off and digest the huge pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that happened to be laying around,</v>

1037
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the,</v>

1038
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.003
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because part of the reason I was trying </v>

1039
00:56:54.871 --> 00:56:55.704
<v Speaker 1>to lay this out over these years is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was trying to figure out </v>

1040
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:04.140
<v Speaker 1>citizens or relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversarial element of the individual.</v>

1041
00:57:04.141 --> 00:57:04.974
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's willfully blind and likes to lie </v>

1042
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:12.170
<v Speaker 1>and tyranny and the abolition of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pause,</v>

1043
00:57:12.171 --> 00:57:14.730
<v Speaker 1>development of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos,</v>

1044
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tendency for deep for things to </v>

1045
00:57:17.671 --> 00:57:18.504
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all causally link and it </v>

1046
00:57:19.861 --> 00:57:21.780
<v Speaker 1>really tight manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's soldier and instance,</v>

1047
00:57:21.781 --> 00:57:25.350
<v Speaker 1>observation and Frankel's observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and handles observation.</v>

1048
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole essence of existentialist</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

1049
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.753
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you supposed to do </v>

1050
00:57:31.441 --> 00:57:36.240
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer seems to be don't have it</v>

1051
00:57:36.241 --> 00:57:38.280
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>

1052
00:57:38.281 --> 00:57:39.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when should you stand up against </v>

1053
00:57:40.801 --> 00:57:42.210
<v Speaker 1>tyranny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1054
00:57:42.211 --> 00:57:43.044
<v Speaker 1>you should stand up against tyranny when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself at micro levels </v>

1055
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.630
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you.</v>

1056
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.133
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that means you have to be awake </v>

1057
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:53.594
<v Speaker 1>all the time for transgressions against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive element of the individual </v>

1058
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:00.830
<v Speaker 1>and the pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of culture,</v>

1059
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and you have to do it right then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you can say,</v>

1060
00:58:03.921 --> 00:58:05.240
<v Speaker 1>and people say this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1061
00:58:05.241 --> 00:58:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I can take my boss on at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1062
00:58:08.001 --> 00:58:09.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to you?</v>

1063
00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't get the next raise,</v>

1064
00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:13.250
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they won't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1065
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1066
00:58:14.121 --> 00:58:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1067
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.300
<v Speaker 1>That's your courage.</v>

1068
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.020
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real tyrant?</v>

1069
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already know the answer to that.</v>

1070
00:58:23.581 --> 00:58:24.414
<v Speaker 1>If you're not even going to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're protected beyond belief by </v>

1071
00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the structure and you have everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you possibly need and you could probably</v>

1072
00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:33.870
<v Speaker 1>even stand up without with and get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

1073
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:34.973
<v Speaker 1>or you could even stand up and you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more respected and the probability </v>

1074
00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that your career would go properly would</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

1075
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:45.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're not going to do it then while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not going to do it when</v>

1076
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's Sadam Hussein or Adolf Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1077
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.340
<v Speaker 1>forget it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wait too late for that.</v>

1078
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.013
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of self evident </v>

1079
00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 1>heroism in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1080
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to go party in the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how brave you are,</v>

1081
00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:01.283
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1082
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.193
<v Speaker 1>but one of Solzhenitsyn's claims and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankl as well was that it was the </v>

1083
00:59:07.891 --> 00:59:12.891
<v Speaker 1>accumulation of micro lies that built up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce the Nazis and the Stalinists.</v>

1084
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was bottom up and top down at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

1085
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Lots of causal interconnections in </v>
<v Speaker 1>loops,</v>

1086
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but basically put up with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition.</v>

1087
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It was only this big and then they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with this acronym position.</v>

1088
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.593
<v Speaker 1>Then they put up with the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition and by the time they noticed </v>

1089
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>that it was really like a major league </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition pointing it out would get you</v>

1090
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 1>arrested while van man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the stakes,</v>

1091
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 1>like when does it end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1092
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't end.</v>

1093
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 1>It just gets worse and worse and worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worse and worse.</v>

1094
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:46.723
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it almost got so bad in 1962 and in </v>

1095
00:59:49.801 --> 00:59:50.634
<v Speaker 1>1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost got so bad that we had the </v>

1096
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 1>third World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was that close.</v>

1097
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.433
<v Speaker 1>So what where it ends is apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you see very often in </v>

1098
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:06.191
<v Speaker 1>religious writings that the sins of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual are linked to the apocalypse.</v>

1099
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.700
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is their link to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse.</v>

1100
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's just that you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the causal connections.</v>

1101
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1102
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>So any questions about that too?</v>

1103
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:21.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the representations in a bit </v>

1104
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>more visible for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1105
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.393
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get the thing on the </v>

1106
01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:29.434
<v Speaker 1>left to be working properly and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stop the thing on the right </v>

1107
01:00:31.571 --> 01:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>from taking over completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1108
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a real balance because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1109
01:00:35.351 --> 01:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with your own children,</v>

1110
01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannizing them?</v>

1111
01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And how do you know when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>socializing them?</v>

1112
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I noticed with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1113
01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:44.734
<v Speaker 1>and this was much to my Chagrin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was lots of times I was confining them </v>

1114
01:00:51.071 --> 01:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>in a tyrannical manner because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>having too much fun,</v>

1115
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you always think you're </v>

1116
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>punishing your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1117
01:00:56.741 --> 01:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>When they're doing something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1118
01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:58.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1119
01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you're yelling at them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running about like,</v>

1120
01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely insane,</v>

1121
01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:04.204
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic hyenas and they're having a great </v>

1122
01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>

1123
01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>what do you treat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to turn them into?</v>

1125
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Some kid that can sit there and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>desk for eight hours when they're in </v>

1126
01:01:14.021 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>grade two and not complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1127
01:01:16.451 --> 01:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>is that an improvement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1128
01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1129
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:26.843
<v Speaker 1>I also noticed with my kids that when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was more tyrannical than might be </v>

1130
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>popular now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with my son,</v>

1131
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I cracked down on them now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's been a little rodent and he</v>

1132
01:01:37.891 --> 01:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really pushy.</v>

1133
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a dominant kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1134
01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you've ever had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant dog,</v>

1135
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but you have to flip those things over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1136
01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.553
<v Speaker 1>on their back all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they just push and push and </v>

1137
01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:54.051
<v Speaker 1>push and he was sort of like that and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd get all uppity and then I talked to</v>

1138
01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>my wife and we'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1139
01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going to let him get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1140
01:01:57.031 --> 01:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>He can't even breathe wrong for the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks,</v>

1141
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:00.324
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time he did a micro mistake we </v>

1142
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>were on him and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1143
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.273
<v Speaker 1>this is a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was so bloody weird about that </v>

1144
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>was every time I did that he liked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1145
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's very much like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with the dominant dog.</v>

1147
01:02:15.301 --> 01:02:16.134
<v Speaker 1>It's like partly what the dog wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is who the hell is in and if it's </v>

1148
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's perfectly happy about that.</v>

1149
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't want there to be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalence about it.</v>

1150
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.433
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1151
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1152
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>like if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

1153
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.253
<v Speaker 1>if he did anything that I thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little crooked or a little dab into a </v>

1154
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>little too pushy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would usually do with him is make</v>

1155
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>them sit on the steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:39.061
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1157
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:39.894
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could communicate more or less at </v>

1158
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>this point because he was around two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half to three.</v>

1159
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.533
<v Speaker 1>The deal was you sit there until you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got yourself controlled and you're </v>

1160
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:51.084
<v Speaker 1>willing to be a civilized human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can come back to me and </v>

1161
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>tell me that and if I like you then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you come up.</v>

1162
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

1163
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you'll have a kid do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back and they say what they</v>

1164
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 1>think you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't mean it.</v>

1165
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1166
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll give him a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you can't do that.</v>

1167
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to see if you like the kid now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they come up properly and say</v>

1168
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 1>things so that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true all the way down instantly.</v>

1169
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not angry at them anymore,</v>

1170
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:21.871
<v Speaker 1>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I like that kid and then so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1172
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:25.643
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your goal is to produce a kid that </v>

1173
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a really good goal,</v>

1174
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>then you don't let them off the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>hook until he's that kid.</v>

1175
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.073
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch what that did to him and I think </v>

1176
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.044
<v Speaker 1>it was part of cortical integration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical integration of hypothalamic </v>

1177
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd sit on the damn steps like this.</v>

1178
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just enraged and I go over to,</v>

1179
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:48.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

1180
01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>are you ready to get off the steps yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go,</v>

1182
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1183
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.653
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd get himself together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he'd come and talk to me and then </v>

1184
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my rule was it's,</v>

1185
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he did it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was over,</v>

1186
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 1>no grudges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1187
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1188
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:05.563
<v Speaker 1>And so that was also very rewarding for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him because he could specify the length </v>

1189
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:10.164
<v Speaker 1>of punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of punishment was as long as </v>

1190
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it took them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start acting like a civilized human</v>

1191
01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:14.604
<v Speaker 1>being again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that was end of </v>

1192
01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1193
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to,</v>

1194
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>that's like tit for tat fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>bug me whack.</v>

1195
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.670
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as your straight again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

1196
01:04:26.671 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll try it again.</v>

1197
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1198
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>what I noticed about him in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a dominant kid,</v>

1199
01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:34.134
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

1200
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd set a rule,</v>

1201
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever the rule was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had to be,</v>

1202
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe you had to go to bed at eight or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1203
01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens if I wait until eight,</v>

1204
01:04:43.581 --> 01:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1205
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>or eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh five or eight,</v>

1206
01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:47.234
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

1207
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he just push until he knew exactly where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line was very pushy,</v>

1208
01:04:52.251 --> 01:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>but it was also extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

1209
01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because someone says there's a rule,</v>

1210
01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.010
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

1211
01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:01.993
<v Speaker 1>You harass and push and push and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed until you find out where the </v>

1212
01:05:04.971 --> 01:05:05.804
<v Speaker 1>boundary actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's nice and firm and doesn't </v>

1213
01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:09.980
<v Speaker 1>move around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

1214
01:05:09.981 --> 01:05:11.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a table.</v>

1215
01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.700
<v Speaker 1>And if I stand up underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I going to whack my head.</v>

1216
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So I won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you move onto something else.</v>

1217
01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>But if the boundaries are going like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this all the time,</v>

1218
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>the kid will just torture you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is exactly what he should do.</v>

1219
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:25.543
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1220
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:27.893
<v Speaker 1>I think whether or not you are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannized your child in the final </v>

1221
01:05:32.581 --> 01:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>analysis depends on exactly what acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically in general depends on which is</v>

1222
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.023
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to make things better or </v>

1223
01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:45.870
<v Speaker 1>worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he aimed at and you know you,</v>

1224
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a way of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't really a way of</v>

1225
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>managing that unless you get the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy clear in your head.</v>

1226
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.983
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to make the world a better </v>

1227
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well part of that is,</v>

1228
01:05:57.161 --> 01:05:57.994
<v Speaker 1>do you think it should exist at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you resentful because it's tragic </v>

1229
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.223
<v Speaker 1>and limited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you angry because you're not as </v>

1230
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:04.714
<v Speaker 1>successful as you could be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have 85 unresolved things with </v>

1231
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:09.040
<v Speaker 1>your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1232
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>are you intimidated by your child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he happens to be successful,</v>

1233
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's going to be more successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

1234
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're going to be able to </v>

1235
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.940
<v Speaker 1>tolerate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1236
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Those are all questions you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think through.</v>

1237
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And you need answers to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 1>and if your goal is I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a child who's better than me,</v>

1239
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.423
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to admit that there could </v>

1240
01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>possibly be something that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you,</v>

1241
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to think that it's </v>

1242
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:33.814
<v Speaker 1>actually your responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate that and you have to be </v>

1243
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:37.684
<v Speaker 1>committed to it and without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well to the degree that you haven't got </v>

1244
01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.134
<v Speaker 1>that formulated and articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in you and acting it out in </v>

1245
01:06:48.801 --> 01:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>your household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a tyrant,</v>

1246
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're tired and upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hungry and you know,</v>

1247
01:06:54.801 --> 01:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe you failed at something and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an argument with your wife or.</v>

1248
01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.473
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1249
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any general rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>except,</v>

1250
01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:02.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a relationship with the kid and </v>

1251
01:07:03.681 --> 01:07:04.514
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes open and made sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at what's best for that </v>

1252
01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:08.683
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to love the child to do </v>

1253
01:07:11.601 --> 01:07:12.434
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out which </v>

1254
01:07:13.341 --> 01:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>part of the child you actually love.</v>

1255
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:16.803
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1256
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1257
01:07:18.741 --> 01:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always envisioned myself rogers.</v>

1258
01:07:21.151 --> 01:07:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It was unconditional positive regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't the way I look at it.</v>

1259
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you come for me to therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of you that wants things</v>

1260
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:30.384
<v Speaker 1>to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not on this side of you that does </v>

1261
01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:34.530
<v Speaker 1>not want things to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1262
01:07:34.531 --> 01:07:35.364
<v Speaker 1>and we have to sort that out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that the reason that you're </v>

1263
01:07:37.231 --> 01:07:41.160
<v Speaker 1>coming for therapy is because you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than things were going to be good</v>

1264
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:42.743
<v Speaker 1>and so I don't even think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to be on the side of the </v>

1265
01:07:44.521 --> 01:07:47.520
<v Speaker 1>client that is aimed at death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery.</v>

1266
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.863
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's there means doesn't </v>

1267
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>mean you should throw the person back </v>
<v Speaker 1>out on the street,</v>

1268
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's there.</v>

1269
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:57.503
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regard in some sense is </v>

1270
01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:00.540
<v Speaker 1>unconditional.</v>

1271
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It isn't done conditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way of thinking about</v>

1272
01:08:04.231 --> 01:08:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a contract which is okay.</v>

1273
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:08.783
<v Speaker 1>Our purpose is to narrow the influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evil and expand the influence of </v>

1274
01:08:13.081 --> 01:08:13.914
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to tell the truth each </v>

1275
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.214
<v Speaker 1>other and an attempt to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that and we're not going to blow </v>

1276
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the relationship apart if horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things come up,</v>

1277
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.133
<v Speaker 1>as long as we're both convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're aiming for and the </v>

1278
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:27.374
<v Speaker 1>communication is actually honest and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unconditional in that you won't </v>

1279
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>break it if things happen that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty unseemly,</v>

1280
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's conditional in that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1281
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:37.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of you that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth and that's going to aim </v>

1282
01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>towards the good and that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want from me.</v>

1283
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of impartial.</v>

1284
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:50.460
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1285
01:08:50.461 --> 01:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stop for 10 minutes.</v>
