1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.003
<v Speaker 1>I become aware of over the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or so that there's a significant </v>

2
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>overlap between the concepts that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you about and Heidi groups work.</v>

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>ideas come from lots of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.233
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to track them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when heidegger was trying to what </v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.703
<v Speaker 1>what heidegger's philosophical program </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially consisted of was the </v>

7
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.224
<v Speaker 1>rediscovery of being now he believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that prior to the ancient Greeks for </v>

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.913
<v Speaker 1>quite rational and modern in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to the world that people lived </v>

9
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:46.864
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship with being that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>much less mediated by interpretive </v>

10
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:53.874
<v Speaker 1>structures I suppose is one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it and he thought of </v>

11
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>being as something that was in framed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the framing,</v>

12
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.853
<v Speaker 1>which is also a term that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The framing restricts the manner in </v>

13
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.514
<v Speaker 1>which being is able to manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a reduction of being </v>

14
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 1>something specific.</v>

15
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Now it's pretty obvious and Heidi girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously knew this,</v>

16
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.844
<v Speaker 1>that in order to interact with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to simultaneously not interact </v>

17
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.284
<v Speaker 1>with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to reduce the phenomenon to </v>

18
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>pinpoint before you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually interact with it in any</v>

19
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.783
<v Speaker 1>immediately useful manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm hiding her points was that </v>

20
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.704
<v Speaker 1>that also restricts our ability to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct contact with speeding and he </v>

21
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>thought of that as like the ground of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

22
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Now I think there's different sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting and perhaps if you're getting to</v>

23
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>is the meaning of the thing that reveals</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to you.</v>

24
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the meaning of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly in some sense.</v>

25
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the meaning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework that you used to interpret the</v>

26
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.444
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the meaning that you </v>

27
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.994
<v Speaker 1>experienced when you transform the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework that you use to look at </v>

28
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

29
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>So those are all forms of meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all interrelated.</v>

30
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.793
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>it has striking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi,</v>

32
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.753
<v Speaker 1>that Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger hiding Heideggerian approach </v>

33
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>to this because in some sense he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>also reacted to niches,</v>

34
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:28.374
<v Speaker 1>ideas about the debt gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was an attempt to help people </v>

35
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.134
<v Speaker 1>reorient themselves in the world in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the novel historical situation where </v>

36
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.593
<v Speaker 1>we had to become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cashed in some ways from our </v>

37
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.084
<v Speaker 1>traditional religious beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were in some sense a form of </v>

38
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

40
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.943
<v Speaker 1>he said the purpose of her religion was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop you from having religious </v>

41
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:57.084
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an interesting way of </v>

42
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.634
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it because what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming was that the purpose of a </v>

43
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:04.674
<v Speaker 1>religious system wants to filter the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming power of being down to a </v>

44
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>point where you could tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it,</v>

45
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.203
<v Speaker 1>but you know the price you paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a certain kind of arbitrary </v>

46
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:17.704
<v Speaker 1>limitation clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always paying the price for </v>

47
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.764
<v Speaker 1>arbitrators invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be nice if you could also </v>

48
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.693
<v Speaker 1>transcended that from time to time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's meaning outside of </v>

49
00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>the frameworks that you</v>

50
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>generally in habit and that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow those frameworks so much that you</v>

51
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:39.810
<v Speaker 1>don't get any of the vivifying form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

52
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.820
<v Speaker 1>You would think of that when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it symbolically.</v>

54
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You would think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of the water of life sounds,</v>

55
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.483
<v Speaker 1>which is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very calm with multisig </v>

56
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.553
<v Speaker 1>fairytales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the king is old and desperate </v>

57
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>guy and the only thing that'll save the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water of life is great.</v>

58
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.173
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother fairy tale just call the </v>

59
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:00.834
<v Speaker 1>water of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has exactly the perfect ms dot </v>

60
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.993
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think I showed you guys this last </v>

61
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:08.580
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

62
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Is the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that okay?</v>

63
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of summed up our discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dragon of chaos.</v>

64
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>What I was trying to trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

65
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:19.254
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing is that there are </v>

66
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:23.424
<v Speaker 1>many different ways of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground of being and you can do it </v>

67
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:30.000
<v Speaker 1>from an objective perspective but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very useful tool,</v>

68
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but I think that is a form of framing.</v>

69
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.413
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of being per se and the being </v>

70
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:38.934
<v Speaker 1>that we were speaking of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his property conceptualized at </v>

71
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>least at least for some purposes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to this diagram which says,</v>

72
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being as a field of information from </v>

73
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:57.771
<v Speaker 1>which you derive the common objects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities that you interact with,</v>

74
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>but also from which you derive your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

75
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v Speaker 1>your own experience and your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of framing and so you can </v>

76
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:09.054
<v Speaker 1>think of reality as that which allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the derivation of those two things </v>

77
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.124
<v Speaker 1>and I also made the case to you that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you could make a strong case that </v>

78
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:18.504
<v Speaker 1>that's actually how your brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain acts like that's the way the </v>

79
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:27.081
<v Speaker 1>world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a secondary case that if that's</v>

80
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>how your brain acts and your regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting,</v>

81
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.240
<v Speaker 1>then you're faced with a problem.</v>

82
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>If you are attempting to make the claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the objective world is the ultimate</v>

83
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 1>reality because that isn't how your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is set up.</v>

84
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.763
<v Speaker 1>At least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it evolved so that you wouldn't die </v>

85
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:49.490
<v Speaker 1>because of your foolish ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied or otherwise.</v>

86
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.883
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can wrestle through that and your </v>

87
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:53.214
<v Speaker 1>own lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult thing to </v>

88
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

89
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this particular diaper,</v>

90
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen this in the book.</v>

91
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:03.884
<v Speaker 1>This is a bit of an elaboration of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of what happens to you when you </v>

92
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.373
<v Speaker 1>encounter a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally what happens is fundamentally </v>

93
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>that your body prepares to do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>manners of things.</v>

94
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Some of those are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.204
<v Speaker 1>Their experience as negative emotion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fundamentally intensive </v>

96
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>protection and protect them so they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>

97
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.543
<v Speaker 1>They can involve pain and frustration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disappointment and shame and guilt </v>

98
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>and all of those sorts of things as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fear.</v>

99
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 1>But then the other side of that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's there's riches to be </v>

100
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:34.694
<v Speaker 1>had when you encounter something novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the parts of your mind that are </v>

101
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.564
<v Speaker 1>associated with creative exploration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reconfiguring of ideas should also </v>

102
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>be put on alert and that is what seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

103
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.613
<v Speaker 1>So basically your response to a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these to compare to do everything and </v>

104
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be very exciting.</v>

105
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.294
<v Speaker 1>It can be extremely compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I think is </v>

106
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.913
<v Speaker 1>really worth thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we'll cover a lot </v>

107
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.030
<v Speaker 1>of the class comes to a halt because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the only optimistic ideas</v>

108
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.113
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to derive from </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology that I actually think might </v>

109
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a really optimistic idea.</v>

110
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.773
<v Speaker 1>Like if you accept the idea that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to construe the ground of </v>

111
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>reality in this manner.</v>

112
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you take seriously the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

113
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.623
<v Speaker 1>the fact of your motivational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're embodied motivational and </v>

114
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.044
<v Speaker 1>emotional response as one thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact of the hierarchy of the </v>

115
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>normally so that some things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous,</v>

116
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of trivial manner.</v>

117
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>And then some things are a novelist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an absolutely terrifying manner.</v>

118
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>But so if you accept that you can draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>further inference,</v>

119
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:49.811
<v Speaker 1>which is the well maybe sometimes things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are anomalous in an optimal manner now.</v>

120
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.103
<v Speaker 1>what we're defined that optimality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's assume that there is a </v>

122
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:00.194
<v Speaker 1>meaningful ground of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then let's assume that there's a </v>

123
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>framing system that you have to use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with that.</v>

124
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.134
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly a consequence of </v>

125
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.083
<v Speaker 1>inculturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's assume that that framing </v>

126
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:13.904
<v Speaker 1>system can get outdated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's all associated with the </v>

127
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>stories that we've been talking about so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

128
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.893
<v Speaker 1>So then let's assume that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be outdated is also an exit </v>

129
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.713
<v Speaker 1>existential problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a constant problem so that not </v>

130
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>only do you need to have a framing </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

131
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:34.154
<v Speaker 1>but you need to have a mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could engage in to update the </v>

132
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:43.031
<v Speaker 1>framing system optimally and then we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that one step further and say,</v>

133
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that's built right into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of your nature is part of your</v>

134
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:48.314
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of the structure of your </v>

135
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we could say,</v>

136
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the hypothesis.</v>

137
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>What if that's what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get engaged with something,</v>

138
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>so imagine what your brain is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

139
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.433
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to situate you in relationship to </v>

140
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>being so that you can both tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you can.</v>

141
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You can tolerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it,</v>

142
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.763
<v Speaker 1>frame it and stay on profit and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind has to be able to signal to </v>

143
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:16.854
<v Speaker 1>you when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's what happens when </v>

144
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you're captured by something and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement.</v>

145
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 1>It is what's happening is your mind is </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you,</v>

146
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>your experiences telling you you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly situated in the right place.</v>

147
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>You're stable enough so you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall apart,</v>

148
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.323
<v Speaker 1>but you're fluid enough so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to fall prey to excess </v>

149
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
<v Speaker 1>stability and then the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a spirit and experience of </v>

150
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.694
<v Speaker 1>engaged meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are phenomena that are </v>

151
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>associated with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's easy to pay attention.</v>

152
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.323
<v Speaker 1>It's just straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to pay attention to things </v>

153
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:56.994
<v Speaker 1>that you're engaged by and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because your your mind roughly </v>

154
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain knows that,</v>

155
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.333
<v Speaker 1>that that information flow is maximized </v>
<v Speaker 1>there so you're not going to be </v>

156
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>terrified and you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>bored.</v>

157
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.573
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't fall apart and you stay </v>

158
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:13.404
<v Speaker 1>updated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the way you experienced that is </v>

159
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>that the meeting is optimized under </v>
<v Speaker 1>those conditions.</v>

160
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

161
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're deep into the material,</v>

162
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's meaningful.</v>

163
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's directly meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

164
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.463
<v Speaker 1>So will this be a framework to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>why say novel music or stories or like </v>

165
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 1>an grossing video game even would induce</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

166
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's another world,</v>

167
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:39.444
<v Speaker 1>so you're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's like an unfolding </v>

168
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.050
<v Speaker 1>experience with both of those at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time because it's,</v>

169
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.103
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to play a video game </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are no rules and you don't </v>

170
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:49.344
<v Speaker 1>want to play a video game where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules transformed so rapidly and </v>

171
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.343
<v Speaker 1>radically that there's no can model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to play a video game where you </v>

172
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>can suspend disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:10:58.801 --> 00:10:59.634
<v Speaker 1>there's some play with the axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there's some things about the </v>

174
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>model of reality that aren't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>like real reality,</v>

175
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.323
<v Speaker 1>but once that framework is established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the rule governed framework is </v>

176
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's play inside of it.</v>

177
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.373
<v Speaker 1>And that's very embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason it's </v>

178
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.774
<v Speaker 1>engrossing is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually learn things from playing </v>

179
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 1>games because in some sense you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always playing a game,</v>

180
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're always inside a reality </v>

181
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:26.154
<v Speaker 1>that's bounded by a certain set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and it's not the total </v>

182
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:29.724
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game like representation of </v>

183
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>the total reality and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it's a good enough gain.</v>

184
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Light Representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

185
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to video games was no,</v>

186
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.613
<v Speaker 1>I've read critiques of Video Games where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people complain about young people </v>

187
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 1>generally being engaged in video games </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the expense,</v>

188
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>having a real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was making,</v>

189
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about Edward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is Ed Edward Castronova</v>

190
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>now he's an economist who studied video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and he did this quite awhile ago.</v>

191
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gotta be more than 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago now,</v>

192
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.344
<v Speaker 1>but he made the claim at that point that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big massive online player </v>

193
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was world of warcraft,</v>

194
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but that might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like the 20th largest economy in the</v>

195
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:21.304
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

196
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In any fate way,</v>

197
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.700
<v Speaker 1>partly because you could sell artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were producing on Ebay,</v>

198
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:30.814
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because people traded </v>

199
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.334
<v Speaker 1>within it and like there was no reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume that the additional level of </v>

200
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.354
<v Speaker 1>abstraction that that video game </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented was necessarily any more </v>

201
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 1>abstract than what we were already doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and economies.</v>

202
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>So then you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

203
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.433
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more real to lead a band of </v>

204
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.204
<v Speaker 1>adventurers through a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological reality in an online game </v>

205
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>or to work at Mcdonald's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you'd say,</v>

206
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what board Mcdonald's?</v>

207
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Because that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

208
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>let's think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exactly why is it real mean,</v>

209
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.014
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is good and exist unless it was </v>

210
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>nested in a whole bunch of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

211
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.263
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be nested in a functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist economy and that has to be </v>

212
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>nested inside a functional political </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

213
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:28.024
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions in terms of material </v>

214
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>supply and so forth that have to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place before you,</v>

215
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 1>before you're able to work there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>receive tokens for your labor.</v>

216
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

217
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.230
<v Speaker 1>the same thing applies to the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and you might say,</v>

218
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:50.700
<v Speaker 1>well how do you determine which of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>is real?</v>

219
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:51.534
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe one of the ways of </v>

220
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:57.621
<v Speaker 1>determining whether a game is real is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what degree do you practice a wide range</v>

221
00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.603
<v Speaker 1>of the sub sets of skills that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transferable to other beings while </v>

222
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:04.584
<v Speaker 1>you're playing that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you could make a case that </v>

223
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:08.124
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing a very complex video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game that the activities that you're </v>

224
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:12.624
<v Speaker 1>engaging in which involve leadership and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and communication and </v>

225
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:16.884
<v Speaker 1>problem solving are actually a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive subset of the skills that </v>

226
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you would have to develop to work in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a complex place.</v>

227
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Then what you would pick up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's.</v>

228
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can argue that,</v>

229
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not self evident.</v>

230
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.293
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

231
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.180
<v Speaker 1>so back to framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

232
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video game,</v>

233
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the types of meeting,</v>

234
00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:49.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the video game </v>
<v Speaker 1>designers really trying to do is put you</v>

235
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.354
<v Speaker 1>in the zone of proximal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a term from the Godspeed who </v>

236
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:55.964
<v Speaker 1>was a Russian development psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was probably the most influential </v>

237
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>developmental psychologist apart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Psj.</v>

238
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what the Gonski noticed was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when parents talk to their children,</v>

239
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.043
<v Speaker 1>they talk to them constantly at a level </v>
<v Speaker 1>that slightly exceeded what brand and </v>

240
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.923
<v Speaker 1>you think that's so cool because on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand they're communicating with their </v>

241
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 1>children because the children can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what they're saying,</v>

242
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand there are teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to communicate,</v>

243
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>to understand more things at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

244
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They're doing that in exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and he thought about is the zone of</v>

245
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.594
<v Speaker 1>proximal development because it was sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dragging the kids pass their current </v>

246
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:34.364
<v Speaker 1>state of of comprehension and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding it and framing into the </v>

247
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>next set.</v>

248
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.123
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of analogous to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle that I mentioned to you </v>

249
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:43.274
<v Speaker 1>earlier about playing a game in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that not only helps you win that game </v>

250
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:48.134
<v Speaker 1>but helps you when all the other games </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to play after you </v>

251
00:15:50.581 --> 00:15:51.414
<v Speaker 1>played that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's playing the game at the zone </v>

252
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 1>of proximal development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it involves generalization and I</v>

253
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.970
<v Speaker 1>would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.043
<v Speaker 1>one of the real debates in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an appalling debate as far as </v>

255
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what's,</v>

256
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.430
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you can buck used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>buttress yourself against the undeniable</v>

257
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 1>because it's obvious to everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence is tragic and it's fundamental</v>

259
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:20.601
<v Speaker 1>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

260
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Because people are limited and fraud and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal.</v>

261
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

262
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:27.794
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was addressed quite well by </v>

263
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 1>traditional religious structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then our ability to assume that they</v>

264
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:37.424
<v Speaker 1>were reasonable ways of framing </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence has been badly damaged or </v>

265
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.484
<v Speaker 1>called into question by the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific and materialistic and object </v>

266
00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:47.524
<v Speaker 1>to thinking.</v>

267
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.410
<v Speaker 1>So the psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

268
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.303
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academic psychological response to </v>

269
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that has been in many ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

270
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:01.691
<v Speaker 1>you're in framing only shields yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>shields you from the tragedy of being.</v>

271
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.343
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a defense mechanism and that's the </v>

272
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>terror management guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

273
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:08.084
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your basic problem is that you're </v>

274
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:10.694
<v Speaker 1>terrified of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other bloody thing that can </v>

275
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 1>be done about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

276
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put up shields of various sorts so that </v>

277
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not constantly assaulted by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem as you go through your life.</v>

278
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's a variant of Freudian theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one theory.</v>

279
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:27.140
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a theory which is positive illusions,</v>

280
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:27.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that it's closely </v>

281
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:31.634
<v Speaker 1>related is that you can just delude </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in an optimal way above the </v>

282
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:36.494
<v Speaker 1>structure of being so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that things are going to work </v>

283
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>out better for you than they probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

284
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.643
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't have to be worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that it's tragic because </v>

285
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you just concentrate on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplistical optimistic,</v>

286
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusions.</v>

287
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.033
<v Speaker 1>It's like no dozer am guessable theories</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they basically say that if you </v>

288
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up and opened your eyes,</v>

289
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 1>what you see would be so terrible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would die,</v>

290
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that you would want to die,</v>

291
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that it would drive you to suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

292
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:04.854
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful before you tell </v>

293
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:07.704
<v Speaker 1>people that that sort of thing is true </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're undermining their </v>

294
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>capacity to live a genuine existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also saying,</v>

295
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't live a genuine existed because</v>

296
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the weight of it would be so heavy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>

297
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.203
<v Speaker 1>It would destroy you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it will drive you into a position </v>

298
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 1>where you want it to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

299
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get so damn pessimistic about </v>

300
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:27.744
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might start thinking about whether </v>

301
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.234
<v Speaker 1>there are other phenomena that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusory or delusional or defense </v>

302
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that actually are </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by meaning.</v>

303
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.800
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I suggested to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you at the beginning of class this class</v>

304
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 1>was that you watched what you said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out if what you said was making you</v>

305
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 1>stronger or weaker and that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually feel that.</v>

306
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.673
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a Rogerian idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>rogers would say that if what you're </v>

307
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:56.724
<v Speaker 1>saying wasn't insane with your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>being roughly speaking is Rogers was </v>

308
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:02.994
<v Speaker 1>really gonna body theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you would feel that as a kind of </v>

309
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>discordance and then that weaken you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a much.</v>

310
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a much older and deeper idea than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

311
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but Roger's articulated very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

312
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:16.014
<v Speaker 1>there's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another experiment that you can </v>

313
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:23.110
<v Speaker 1>run that's also very much worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>attending do,</v>

314
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 1>which is watch and see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

315
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just notice,</v>

316
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.543
<v Speaker 1>notice when you're engaged in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that the fact of you doing it </v>

317
00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:38.940
<v Speaker 1>is sufficient for the tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 1>because you could say so thankful they </v>
<v Speaker 1>come club this way.</v>

319
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a bounded creature and so </v>

320
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're beset on all sides by tragedy and</v>

321
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:47.304
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know now that might be necessary </v>

322
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.013
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be a reason why that's the </v>

323
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:53.934
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't bother with that at the </v>

324
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:56.370
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that later.</v>

325
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.493
<v Speaker 1>The question then is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there conditions under which you </v>

326
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:05.451
<v Speaker 1>would regard that as acceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer isn't what people think about.</v>

327
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right answer is all.</v>

328
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention and notice if there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>times like that,</v>

329
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's horace,</v>

330
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>that noticing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the eye.</v>

331
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not thinking because it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing process.</v>

332
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.643
<v Speaker 1>It's something outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's watching and I </v>

333
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:28.140
<v Speaker 1>think if you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see if you go through your week,</v>

334
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice if you have to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand outside yourself and think,</v>

335
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really into that.</v>

336
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I was pulled right inside it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see phenomenon that occur along with</v>

337
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>that which chip and the hiatus detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably in his,</v>

338
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 1>in his work on flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice the passing of.</v>

339
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You're not self conscious and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity is sustaining.</v>

340
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You experienced it as sustain even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it might be difficult,</v>

341
00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a matter of just take easy </v>

342
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 1>way out doing something fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>

343
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.023
<v Speaker 1>It can be that it's often you feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way when you're doing something that's </v>

344
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:08.074
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally challenging and difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually I think it's those things </v>

345
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 1>that are they're real in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal hierarchy,</v>

346
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

347
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:17.703
<v Speaker 1>they're moving you forward in the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've determined that moving </v>

348
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 1>forward is appropriate in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've sorted that out.</v>

349
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know a implies B and B in place.</v>

350
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.583
<v Speaker 1>See it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see implies d and so forth and you've </v>

351
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:30.180
<v Speaker 1>sorted that all out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.023
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're working on an essay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class that you find meaningful </v>

353
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:34.804
<v Speaker 1>because you want to derive something </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful from your education so that </v>

354
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a good citizen so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>live a proper life,</v>

355
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the chaining of all those things </v>

356
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.293
<v Speaker 1>makes the local activity quite richly </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful because it's properly </v>

357
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>contextualized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the other element which</v>

358
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>is when you're pushing yourself beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

359
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.313
<v Speaker 1>not only do you experience the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you're doing in relationship to </v>

360
00:21:56.411 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 1>your goal hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also transcend the goal hierarchy at</v>

361
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the same time so that while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>working towards realizing it,</v>

362
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.033
<v Speaker 1>you're also working towards transforming</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and improving it all at the same </v>

363
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:11.374
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you're set up to </v>

364
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 1>experience that as as the highest form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

365
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.333
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a corollary to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe if you spent the bulk of </v>

366
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:24.630
<v Speaker 1>your time doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.220
<v Speaker 1>so you've got practice data to you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

368
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

369
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.643
<v Speaker 1>you could figure it out for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my suspicions are that for many of </v>

370
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:33.364
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably five percent of your </v>

371
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:38.254
<v Speaker 1>weekly life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm wrong about that because it's </v>

372
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.534
<v Speaker 1>been a long time since I was your age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what it was like </v>

373
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.654
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>but I do know when I survey </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates and I asked them how much</v>

375
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>time they waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:22:49.031 --> 00:22:49.864
<v Speaker 1>they're telling me generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's four to six hours a day and I </v>

377
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 1>actually think it's probably more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

378
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's time not spent in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular state of mind and it's wasted</v>

379
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:01.564
<v Speaker 1>time while you even recognize it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasted time because when someone asks </v>

380
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you if it's wasted time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say yes and it's like,</v>

381
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.320
<v Speaker 1>well wasted.</v>

382
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.553
<v Speaker 1>It's wasted and you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously comparing that to some </v>

383
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 1>other sort of time that isn't wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

384
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:15.574
<v Speaker 1>That you regard as valuable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and worth engaging and even </v>

385
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:19.744
<v Speaker 1>though it might be difficult and require</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline and all those sorts of </v>

386
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might ask yourself,</v>

387
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:24.934
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have times during the week where </v>

388
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:27.994
<v Speaker 1>you were engaged in often what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so that you find that </v>

389
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically meaningful and it removes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the burden of tragedy,</v>

390
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied,</v>

391
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean because you're experiencing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing as intrinsically worth the </v>

392
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing.</v>

393
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.841
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

394
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>well what if you were in that of mind 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

395
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.680
<v Speaker 1>85 percent of the time or 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

396
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that requires a tremendous amount of</v>

397
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:54.914
<v Speaker 1>discipline and organization and clarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of purpose and it also requires a </v>

398
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:03.341
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount with the truth because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy of setting yourself up so that</v>

399
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.144
<v Speaker 1>you can do that is untruth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is to the degree </v>

400
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that you engage in on the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

401
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.103
<v Speaker 1>you contaminate your frames </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and then you're in real </v>

402
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.204
<v Speaker 1>trouble because you won't be oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly if you're afraid to </v>

403
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.073
<v Speaker 1>contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're contaminated to the degree that </v>

404
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 1>you build them out of nonsense in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion.</v>

405
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

406
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 3>absolutely agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And probably a natural state,</v>

407
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 3>natural approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reciprocal.</v>

408
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's natural to be a chimpanzee </v>

409
00:24:50.941 --> 00:24:51.774
<v Speaker 1>is sitting in the jungle spending eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day eating leaves because you </v>

410
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not smart enough to do any better</v>

411
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:57.900
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

413
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.880
<v Speaker 1>so naturals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tough,</v>

414
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>a tough conception.</v>

415
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like restaurant.</v>

416
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could argue that,</v>

417
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.880
<v Speaker 1>oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

418
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.733
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have fall asleep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the right thing to do is to </v>

419
00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:15.270
<v Speaker 1>have leisure time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you,</v>

420
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this from my own experience that </v>

421
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.990
<v Speaker 1>an hour of actual leisure time beats a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month of undeserved holiday.</v>

422
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

423
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:28.250
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.113
<v Speaker 1>actual leisure time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have anything that </v>

425
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.104
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be doing at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more important than having a </v>

426
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's nothing about that,</v>

427
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that self deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.604
<v Speaker 1>like you're on trying to escape from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities by watching a </v>

429
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 1>youtube video about joggers falling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice or something like that,</v>

430
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:51.320
<v Speaker 1>which apparently is quite a popular one </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

431
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.400
<v Speaker 1>So you know when you know perfectly well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you spend time like that,</v>

432
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:56.234
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're avoiding doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you've known that you </v>

433
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 1>should be doing using your own standards</v>
<v Speaker 1>of judgment,</v>

434
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.350
<v Speaker 1>that all it does is make you sick.</v>

435
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

436
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical revulsion that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

437
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that is,</v>

438
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:10.304
<v Speaker 1>is your body telling you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminating your being by engaging in </v>

439
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:16.724
<v Speaker 1>such low quality activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's something else </v>

440
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 1>that you know you should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not restful.</v>

441
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.613
<v Speaker 1>I think that's extremely stressful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is you basically </v>

442
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>tear yourself in to and why does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant say you're useless?</v>

443
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And the other is like a critical notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

444
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Say I can't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:39.530
<v Speaker 1>when it's a terrible state of being to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in because you're a slave at the same</v>

446
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 1>time and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressful.</v>

447
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not restful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking to you.</v>

448
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:46.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're describing students how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a break and watch the show for </v>

449
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:54.790
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like going,</v>

450
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're constantly like,</v>

451
00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it takes real practice over </v>

452
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:10.011
<v Speaker 1>in part of what you'll be reading about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book is the necessity of adopting</v>

454
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>an apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:12.534
<v Speaker 1>because you have to focus yourself in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and really you have to focus </v>

456
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:17.274
<v Speaker 1>in heart and you have to do it for quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time before you have or yourself </v>

457
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:22.044
<v Speaker 1>into a good enough shape so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>even start telling the difference </v>

458
00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:29.841
<v Speaker 1>between reasonable use of leisure time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pathological time wasting,</v>

459
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.370
<v Speaker 1>which are by no means the same thing.</v>

460
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to get it right.</v>

461
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to attend a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal cubes,</v>

462
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're sitting in front of the </v>

463
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 1>screen and you're feeling somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>uneasy,</v>

464
00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:46.260
<v Speaker 1>if disgusted by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to think,</v>

465
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what's going on here.</v>

466
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.753
<v Speaker 1>Am I being too hard on myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually need a break and I won't </v>

467
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:54.714
<v Speaker 1>allow that because I'm a tyrant and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sneaking one even though I'm tired </v>

468
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.364
<v Speaker 1>and should ever break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard to get because then that </v>

469
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 1>would be an attitude issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

470
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.073
<v Speaker 1>Are you have you conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for leisure property and then </v>

471
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>the other possibility is while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just being useless and you know it,</v>

472
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

473
00:28:14.481 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that shouldn't be happening.</v>

474
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:17.574
<v Speaker 1>Something else should be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means a straight forward </v>

475
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:21.180
<v Speaker 1>thing to get those things right.</v>

476
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a hint about that,</v>

477
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:26.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've worked with lots of people </v>

478
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:28.734
<v Speaker 1>who they're not wasting time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're not wasting five minutes </v>

479
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.923
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes because of the demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like usually because the demands on </v>

480
00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:37.734
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put themselves in a position where </v>

481
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:44.031
<v Speaker 1>the demands on them are so high that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they waste anytime they will fail.</v>

482
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.043
<v Speaker 1>And so a typical person like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of you are going to end up in </v>

483
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 1>those situations if you're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

484
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>So a technical person like that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging job.</v>

485
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.213
<v Speaker 1>So it's a complex job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to manipulate a lot of </v>

486
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 1>variables constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be attentive and alert,</v>

487
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.133
<v Speaker 1>focused and conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to do that for long </v>

488
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like well up,</v>

489
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:10.470
<v Speaker 1>depends on the level of attainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're after,</v>

490
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to attain at the peak of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chosen discipline,</v>

491
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>it's 60 to 80 hours a week and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are concentrated,</v>

492
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>useful hours.</v>

493
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Now some are more useful than others </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to get tired,</v>

494
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

495
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have kids?</v>

496
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to do both of those,</v>

497
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have kind of wakes,</v>

498
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any time to waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

499
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.344
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to get hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient and then you have to ask </v>

500
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

501
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but how much work should I do know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the limit should like,</v>

502
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the right limit?</v>

503
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Well the answer to that is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

504
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't work any harder than you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain across weeks,</v>

505
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.490
<v Speaker 1>months and years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

506
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So some of the people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>counseled who are hyper efficient,</v>

507
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 1>one of the holes like fall into is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked so hard.</v>

508
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.603
<v Speaker 1>They start getting inefficient and part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that is they're not paying attention </v>

509
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>to their family to guilty about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

510
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.033
<v Speaker 1>Maybe their relationship is becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable and that's going to cost them </v>

511
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:25.960
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like once you're married,</v>

512
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:26.794
<v Speaker 1>if you let that go and you get into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce battle and it's a custody </v>

513
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are screwed.</v>

514
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.173
<v Speaker 1>So like you have to really watch that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make sure it doesn't happen because </v>

515
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like a major illness to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

516
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:40.384
<v Speaker 1>It's not good and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never really recovered from it in </v>

517
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 1>some sense because you end up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured,</v>

518
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're close,</v>

519
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships are fractured and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to do.</v>

520
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.083
<v Speaker 1>So up you're much more likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorced in your second marriage than </v>

521
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you were in your first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be like you could hop out of</v>

522
00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 1>one into a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>and then also people tired themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

524
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so often with the more hyper efficient </v>

525
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:06.814
<v Speaker 1>people and often a lot of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were women and I think the reason for </v>

526
00:31:09.521 --> 00:31:11.710
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.723
<v Speaker 1>once they have kids in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really torn between two sets of </v>

528
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:16.744
<v Speaker 1>fundamental obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for the first three years of </v>

529
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 1>the kid's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

530
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:21.184
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really hard for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance rate at to figure out what </v>

531
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.233
<v Speaker 1>that balance is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one rule is you got to treat </v>

532
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 1>yourself well enough so you can iterate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your activities.</v>

533
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.313
<v Speaker 1>If you can be playing a degenerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and it's a variant of the pig and </v>

534
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the calibrating state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

535
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.043
<v Speaker 1>And it could have a great state will </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain itself and that can be within </v>

536
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:44.674
<v Speaker 1>you or can be within a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can be either in you or within a </v>

537
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 1>group of people across a long span of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

538
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's really well equilibrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the people that I dealt with</v>

539
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.053
<v Speaker 1>who were working themselves too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out ways they can take </v>

540
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.163
<v Speaker 1>vacations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't usually decreased the </v>

541
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>number of hours per week or per week </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't possible.</v>

542
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.343
<v Speaker 1>Just the demands of the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the law firm or something like </v>

543
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:10.721
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

544
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you might think what Cathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lighten up.</v>

545
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:17.560
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is you don't get paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>$750 an hour for lightening up.</v>

546
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.903
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're on call right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever your client wants you and the </v>

547
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:23.760
<v Speaker 1>answer isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

548
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to take a break.</v>

549
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.963
<v Speaker 1>Like then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't get the pay because </v>

550
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:29.344
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're paying is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things I noticed quite </v>

551
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 1>quickly was the people scheduled their </v>
<v Speaker 1>time so they took more vacations.</v>

552
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 1>The number of hours they can work </v>
<v Speaker 1>productively actually went up,</v>

553
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>not down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can get the balance right,</v>

554
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simple thing to do,</v>

555
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.633
<v Speaker 1>but so isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only going to find engagement in </v>

556
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.274
<v Speaker 1>sheer physical productive activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of places where you can be </v>

557
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.120
<v Speaker 1>engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be engaged in art,</v>

558
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you can be engaged in literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been engaged in relationships.</v>

559
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.413
<v Speaker 1>You can be engaged in your children like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of places of </v>

560
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:06.824
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to interact with those </v>

561
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.054
<v Speaker 1>places of meeting property and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to organize the multiple places where </v>

562
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:16.874
<v Speaker 1>you derive meaning in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustaining to all of them and that's </v>

563
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 1>what you've got your grain right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting your frame rate isn't enough</v>

564
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.283
<v Speaker 1>because you have to get your frame right</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that allows you to update your </v>

565
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 1>frame as you continue moving forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

566
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.843
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe because I do believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world that were adapted to as </v>

567
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:39.761
<v Speaker 1>biological organisms is the world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is information.</v>

568
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I believe that when when your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system signals to you that all is well,</v>

569
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 1>all is well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

570
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You're in the right place at the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

571
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.873
<v Speaker 1>You're bearing exactly the right amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of load and the right amount of load is </v>

572
00:33:55.701 --> 00:34:00.701
<v Speaker 1>enough to keep you talked and ready and </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve,</v>

573
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.743
<v Speaker 1>and when you slip into that slot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of the existential problems </v>

574
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:08.760
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

575
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.013
<v Speaker 1>that arise to push people towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and hopelessness or or </v>

576
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:17.370
<v Speaker 1>sometimes towards totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>

577
00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:18.204
<v Speaker 1>that rigidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem just goes away and it's </v>

578
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>because you solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because it's not a problem,</v>

579
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a bloody problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you know,</v>

580
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.503
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that monitor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do is they conceptualize </v>

581
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:33.974
<v Speaker 1>themselves as the defeated aim priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that the fact that life is </v>

582
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 1>tragic and that you're not all you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in,</v>

583
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 1>that everything will come to an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're not.</v>

584
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>By definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not up to the task.</v>

585
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's by no means obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

586
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.370
<v Speaker 1>People are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're so tough.</v>

587
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:53.204
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you know you see that on </v>

588
00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:55.274
<v Speaker 1>Youtube with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want to look at Youtube </v>

589
00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:58.110
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can feel terrible above it.</v>

590
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:01.483
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I do like looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or the extreme sports that people </v>

591
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:05.630
<v Speaker 1>engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and I mean people can do unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

593
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>They're completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely off their rocker,</v>

594
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:11.783
<v Speaker 1>know they can do things with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies that you just can't possibly </v>

595
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for example at there was a</v>

596
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:17.684
<v Speaker 1>video that went around the wild ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it was a video tape of the woman </v>

597
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:21.854
<v Speaker 1>who won the 1956 I'm hurdling know we </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounce off of one of those horses for </v>

598
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:29.684
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics and so she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her routine was videotaped and then the </v>

599
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:35.144
<v Speaker 1>next video tape was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who won the gold in the </v>

600
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:38.184
<v Speaker 1>Olympics at the last Olympics and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the first woman did this really </v>

601
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 1>cool role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often fall off the horse.</v>

602
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:45.294
<v Speaker 1>It was quite spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the second one was like 20 </v>

603
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>feet in the air with for flipped end </v>
<v Speaker 1>over end,</v>

604
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertically.</v>

605
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 1>If they wasn't my favorite night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't even the same creatures,</v>

606
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:56.454
<v Speaker 1>why don't look like some kind of kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like android kangaroo and the other </v>

607
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pretty competent gym teacher.</v>

608
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean God only knows what the limits of</v>

609
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:10.040
<v Speaker 1>human ability are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we certainly haven't touched them.</v>

610
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:10.874
<v Speaker 1>And you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you have no idea what you're </v>

611
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.643
<v Speaker 1>capable of if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really got your acts together </v>

612
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.553
<v Speaker 1>when you were a force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because another thing you might think </v>

613
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:20.874
<v Speaker 1>about is maybe the existential misery </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you experienced in your life is </v>

614
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Speaker 1>directly proportional to the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you waste.</v>

615
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the dragon gardens a treasure,</v>

616
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your job is to get the damn treasure</v>

617
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need it.</v>

618
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not optional without the treasury.</v>

619
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the riches necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live all the time.</v>

620
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:43.104
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting his time that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent in the treasure room </v>

621
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

622
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not spending all your time in </v>

623
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 1>the treasurer room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't complain about being poor.</v>

624
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good thing to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what makes it optimistic.</v>

626
00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that if you utilize what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in front of you,</v>

627
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and so that will be the ground of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say if you utilize that,</v>

628
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.060
<v Speaker 1>that would be enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you could get even really lucky</v>

629
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you utilize it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't just be enough.</v>

630
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.450
<v Speaker 1>That would be more than enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

631
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 1>so you could go from say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

632
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:20.000
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to be a limited and mortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>being too saying,</v>

633
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a pretty damn good deal and if I</v>

634
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd sign on for it again.</v>

635
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 1>That was actually niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the eternal return,</v>

636
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when he was trying to figure out what</v>

637
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:34.010
<v Speaker 1>people should do as a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse of the ethical system,</v>

638
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.500
<v Speaker 1>it constituted classical religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

639
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.730
<v Speaker 1>He conjured up the idea of eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

640
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It was roughly this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should live in such a way so that if</v>

641
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you had to repeat what you were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever into infinity,</v>

642
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 1>you would say yes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an,</v>

643
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.163
<v Speaker 1>that's an idea like the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except obviously it's stretched into </v>

644
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 1>huge expanses of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

645
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a high level thing to a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

646
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.000
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another example.</v>

647
00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get stuck in,</v>

648
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>in very bureaucratic organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.100
<v Speaker 1>and they just get bloody well tortured </v>
<v Speaker 1>by death because it's mindless tyranny,</v>

650
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.483
<v Speaker 1>stupid rules and and on arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and counterproductive </v>

651
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:24.051
<v Speaker 1>management advice and jealousy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment for doing well and you know,</v>

652
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.553
<v Speaker 1>everything you can do to possibly set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation where the person who's got </v>

653
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 1>the jaw is just crushed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people won't say anything.</v>

654
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.231
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

655
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

656
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 1>why do you want me to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks stupid.</v>

657
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And they might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

658
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have thought it was stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

659
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone else told me to do it.</v>

660
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Highly probable that they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that.</v>

661
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.403
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you just refused to do </v>

662
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless meetings,</v>

663
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 1>meaningless things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

664
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel stupid.</v>

665
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Useless for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

666
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

667
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this happen many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the corporation gets.</v>

668
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.043
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an elephant that gets loaded </v>

669
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:10.680
<v Speaker 1>with intestinal parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

670
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that as a biological analogy,</v>

671
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:14.854
<v Speaker 1>I really do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a corporation is a body in some </v>

672
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.064
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a tremendous amount of building </v>

673
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:20.764
<v Speaker 1>value and what can happen as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation develops as it gets full of </v>

674
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 1>people who just pull up the value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually do anything.</v>

675
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.110
<v Speaker 1>They raped the brand is what they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the brand has value.</v>

676
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:31.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Disney brand has value because </v>

677
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:35.650
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and if you want it to destroy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take over the company and you've put</v>

679
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:40.534
<v Speaker 1>out snow white too and snow white three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like five and snow white 12 until </v>

680
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:45.933
<v Speaker 1>and everybody would buy it until like </v>
<v Speaker 1>snow white 20 when they would trust you </v>

681
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.110
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've sucked all the value out</v>

682
00:39:51.111 --> 00:39:53.650
<v Speaker 1>of the company and its death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

683
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.603
<v Speaker 1>or you get people who come into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation and all they want to do is </v>

684
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:58.414
<v Speaker 1>maneuver up to the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a damn about what the </v>

685
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:01.774
<v Speaker 1>thing is supposed to be producing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how they're structuring their </v>

686
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 1>relationships with other people or about</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that has to do with the truth.</v>

687
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:09.754
<v Speaker 1>They use language instrumental to reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>their goals and you get people like </v>

688
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company and it's like it's dead.</v>

689
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.203
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to companies all the </v>

690
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>time because they don't last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

691
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.550
<v Speaker 1>This is why Marx was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

692
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>he said power and money accumulate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hands of fewer and fewer people.</v>

693
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>What he didn't say is it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

694
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:30.280
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same people.</v>

696
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.203
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most family fortunes don't last three </v>

697
00:40:36.371 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 1>generations and neither do most large </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

698
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of dynamic turnover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

699
00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to be working in </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

700
00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:45.094
<v Speaker 1>The Lord have you at at least at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point it pretty damn significant levels </v>

701
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and even at an entry level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more power than you think.</v>

702
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.173
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not necessary to do things you </v>

703
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 1>know are stupid and meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>

704
00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:58.803
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

705
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>if the situation that you're in is </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding that,</v>

706
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

707
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should be somewhere else.</v>

708
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

709
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.283
<v Speaker 1>I can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would say to that is prepared to </v>

710
00:41:13.951 --> 00:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go into a company and</v>

711
00:41:18.731 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>you want to live ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need an escape strategy and you need</v>

712
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:23.860
<v Speaker 1>to have that along with you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

713
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:27.720
<v Speaker 1>so you need an updated resume and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be keeping your damn on,</v>

714
00:41:27.721 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 1>on the job market so that you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the other opportunities along live</v>

715
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 1>for you and so you're not afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue them.</v>

716
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to hold your interview </v>

717
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to keep your damn resume on a</v>

718
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make sure you have a broad</v>

719
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 1>social network and you have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>

720
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.463
<v Speaker 1>And so even if some Dane back tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do stump to something </v>

721
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.980
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>

722
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 1>and we'll push it one step farther than </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly unethical,</v>

723
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you can say no and you can meet it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no means I'm not doing that.</v>

724
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.273
<v Speaker 1>And if you push me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll either have a war or I'll go </v>

725
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:04.200
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

726
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that's what no means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's what it means.</v>

727
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:07.723
<v Speaker 1>It means I'm not doing this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't say no till you haven't an </v>

728
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:12.201
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

729
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.034
<v Speaker 1>You have to set yourself up so that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't kill you because obviously then </v>

730
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:17.894
<v Speaker 1>you won't say it needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are important things to consider </v>

731
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.013
<v Speaker 1>because the actions that you take up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of your individual career are </v>

732
00:42:24.801 --> 00:42:29.180
<v Speaker 1>going to have far more impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics and the productivity of the place</v>

733
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:30.014
<v Speaker 1>that you worked and then you can imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're someone who's </v>

734
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.793
<v Speaker 1>straight and sees what's right in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their face because those are the </v>

735
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 1>people that keep the data companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>running and there's not necessarily that</v>

736
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:41.264
<v Speaker 1>many of them know the prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Law Rule is that square root of the </v>

737
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 1>number of people who are doing your job </v>
<v Speaker 1>do half the work.</v>

738
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that in a company of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand people,</v>

739
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.513
<v Speaker 1>30 people are doing half the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you could be one of them </v>

740
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:56.474
<v Speaker 1>and then if you are one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you can bloody well say no </v>

741
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.313
<v Speaker 1>because they actually need you and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>your last would be can be a catastrophe </v>

742
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:06.543
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you want to aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to be the person </v>

743
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:09.344
<v Speaker 1>who's lost would be a catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you've got some power and </v>

744
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 1>then you can bargain and then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do a stupid,</v>

745
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 1>useless crooked things and you'll have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better life if you don't have to do</v>

746
00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:23.270
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>

747
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:24.860
<v Speaker 1>very practical advice.</v>

748
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.473
<v Speaker 3>So when you were talking about how like </v>
<v Speaker 3>divorce and like if you have a family </v>

749
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:37.903
<v Speaker 3>and you have like a divorced people </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes never thought into that and I </v>

750
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 3>remember you saying that it is locked </v>
<v Speaker 3>before too.</v>

751
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so horrible and what am I people to</v>

752
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.370
<v Speaker 3>come?</v>

753
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's think about this for a minute</v>

754
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.800
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go back to the symbolic stuff.</v>

755
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.280
<v Speaker 1>How many chances do you think you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in your life for it?</v>

756
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:03.270
<v Speaker 1>For like a serious high quality intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

757
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.093
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many chances are you going to have </v>

758
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 1>for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

759
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

760
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably top out in a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

761
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.720
<v Speaker 1>so that's not that many chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get old quick.</v>

762
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:28.343
<v Speaker 1>You know by the time you're 45 you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to have a family and the well </v>

763
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you can do that sometimes if you're male</v>
<v Speaker 1>or female maybe,</v>

764
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but it gets pretty rough and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking probably at that point you had a</v>

765
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of in vitro and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions top.</v>

766
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's hard on people so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only you not have that many chances,</v>

767
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that much time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to get it right.</v>

768
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you get it wrong and costs you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it'll cost you five years,</v>

769
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.880
<v Speaker 1>five years is a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and three,</v>

770
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:00.714
<v Speaker 1>five year cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lost things there that you can't </v>

771
00:45:06.011 --> 00:45:07.120
<v Speaker 1>replace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

772
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.983
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part of it is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that many chances and it's costly </v>

773
00:45:11.261 --> 00:45:14.380
<v Speaker 1>to to burn up the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

774
00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:15.560
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is,</v>

775
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

776
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.880
<v Speaker 1>divorce is very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not so bad if you get divorced</v>

777
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.780
<v Speaker 1>to someone who's reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often the reason that you're getting</v>

778
00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:30.614
<v Speaker 1>divorced is that one or the other or </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of you aren't that reasonable and </v>

779
00:45:34.371 --> 00:45:35.204
<v Speaker 1>what that might mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be negotiating with someone </v>

780
00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.970
<v Speaker 1>whose basic goal is to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have another day of success in</v>

781
00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the next 20 years and if that's their </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

782
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.390
<v Speaker 1>they will attain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

783
00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:48.224
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of ways people do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they usually do it by owning the </v>

784
00:45:50.361 --> 00:45:54.290
<v Speaker 1>children hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will definitely do that.</v>

785
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.330
<v Speaker 1>They do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

786
00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.080
<v Speaker 1>so you want to avoid that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

787
00:46:00.081 --> 00:46:03.080
<v Speaker 1>then of course it's hard on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship you have with your children</v>

788
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.303
<v Speaker 1>and like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are probably the most important </v>

789
00:46:07.491 --> 00:46:09.460
<v Speaker 1>relationships you have in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

790
00:46:09.461 --> 00:46:13.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like might be parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be siblings,</v>

791
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.790
<v Speaker 1>might be your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be your kids.</v>

792
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:18.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think when it comes right down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

793
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.293
<v Speaker 1>your parents are old and so were you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your kids aren't and they're just </v>

794
00:46:24.711 --> 00:46:28.490
<v Speaker 1>as close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus they need you and so will you start</v>

795
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.990
<v Speaker 1>twisting and messing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not About,</v>

796
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:31.700
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on your psyche.</v>

797
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard on the kids too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know.</v>

798
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.090
<v Speaker 3>So then I'm just thinking about that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how that's a cost.</v>

799
00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.380
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you mess it up like a five year cost,</v>

800
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.040
<v Speaker 3>they cost you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

801
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:44.143
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be a 15 year cost if you </v>

802
00:46:45.221 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 1>were in a custody battle and cost you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a million dollars,</v>

803
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 3>But like is it then would you say like </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a psychologist,</v>

805
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.283
<v Speaker 3>that it's better for people to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue a relationship that's not good </v>

806
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:01.363
<v Speaker 3>enough to continue to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly incur further costs than it is </v>

807
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.490
<v Speaker 3>to just cut it off because it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>divorce.</v>

808
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated question.</v>

809
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.443
<v Speaker 1>What I would say is don't make the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mistakes that get you into such a </v>

810
00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:15.040
<v Speaker 1>stupid relationship to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

811
00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

812
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:18.223
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that is by trying not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to delude yourself any more than is </v>

813
00:47:21.321 --> 00:47:22.154
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means when you're in the damn </v>

814
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:25.874
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the person the truth and trying to </v>

815
00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the truth for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't put up with any nonsense and stand</v>

816
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 1>up for yourself and also aimed towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good,</v>

817
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do all those things,</v>

818
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 1>then your relationship is probably going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work if you're trying to do all those</v>

819
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:42.724
<v Speaker 1>things really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have a partner that will not do </v>

820
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then leave.</v>

821
00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.513
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

822
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.243
<v Speaker 1>it's a rare person who will do that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stepped along the way property </v>

823
00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:56.600
<v Speaker 1>and they learn how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

824
00:47:56.601 --> 00:47:57.434
<v Speaker 1>not everyone's like that because you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>run into some people who are basically </v>

825
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.130
<v Speaker 1>devoted towards mayhem and trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

826
00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.143
<v Speaker 1>But usually you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person is a balance of striving for </v>

827
00:48:07.971 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the good and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messing about in the health.</v>

828
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're both like that.</v>

829
00:48:12.921 --> 00:48:16.790
<v Speaker 1>When you start a relationship and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to tilt it towards the good and then</v>

830
00:48:16.791 --> 00:48:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you will run into that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

831
00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:21.350
<v Speaker 1>But you have to do that right from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the relationship.</v>

832
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take that much to corrupt a </v>

833
00:48:23.361 --> 00:48:26.630
<v Speaker 1>relationship so that it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>salvageable.</v>

834
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.020
<v Speaker 1>It the mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three or four acts of infidelity,</v>

835
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.633
<v Speaker 1>your doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to come back from that </v>

836
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:34.304
<v Speaker 1>because the fundamental element of trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being removed and then you can </v>

837
00:48:37.341 --> 00:48:38.174
<v Speaker 1>communicate with the person because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if they're telling you the </v>

838
00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:40.454
<v Speaker 1>truth and then you don't know if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with reality and if you're not </v>

839
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>dealing with reality with your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like good luck fixing that.</v>

840
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're working on a ghost car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the real one is sitting in the shop</v>

841
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.913
<v Speaker 1>with the motor on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not going to get you </v>

842
00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:54.334
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the issue is don't get into </v>

843
00:48:56.541 --> 00:49:00.050
<v Speaker 1>trouble to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are in the trouble,</v>

844
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.890
<v Speaker 1>well then you try to straighten yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and see if you can fix it.</v>

845
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't,</v>

846
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.820
<v Speaker 1>your options aren't great and it depends</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the particularities of the situation.</v>

847
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Not Know I have people that I counseled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like leave that person and the role</v>

848
00:49:15.471 --> 00:49:16.304
<v Speaker 1>is they're lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't aiming up and you won't be </v>

849
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:28.181
<v Speaker 1>able to tolerate being with them for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years without becoming resentful,</v>

850
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.170
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic and homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a bad outcome.</v>

851
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do to avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well leave and.</v>

852
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have.</v>

853
00:49:38.751 --> 00:49:41.300
<v Speaker 1>That sort of note has to be the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's no fun.</v>

854
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It's no good to leave someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling in an alert.</v>

855
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>

856
00:49:45.201 --> 00:49:46.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with this person.</v>

857
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.110
<v Speaker 1>They're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

858
00:49:48.111 --> 00:49:51.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have an alcohol problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful.</v>

859
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm all they've got,</v>

860
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.823
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

861
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:56.543
<v Speaker 1>they bloody well better want to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix that because you're not going to </v>

862
00:49:59.051 --> 00:49:59.884
<v Speaker 1>deal with fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that'll happen is you'll end up in </v>

863
00:50:02.011 --> 00:50:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if they really want to fix more than</v>

864
00:50:06.271 --> 00:50:07.104
<v Speaker 1>anything and they're willing to tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth about it and willing to interact </v>

865
00:50:10.801 --> 00:50:13.590
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a ghost of a chance.</v>

866
00:50:13.591 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 1>You might pull through it,</v>

867
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.223
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

868
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.983
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to fix someone and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard to fix someone who does not </v>

869
00:50:21.111 --> 00:50:23.450
<v Speaker 1>want to be fixed and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

870
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So my</v>

871
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.660
<v Speaker 3>parents divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

872
00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:33.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that a lot of failing,</v>

873
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.193
<v Speaker 3>you're marketing the kid if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had to deal with a lot of the </v>

874
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.030
<v Speaker 3>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like choosing your parents.</v>

875
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.140
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when everyone asks like,</v>

876
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:46.780
<v Speaker 3>do you like something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawyers?</v>

877
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:47.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

878
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:48.893
<v Speaker 3>I see how much they fight now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can't imagine having that happen </v>

879
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.970
<v Speaker 3>like school,</v>

880
00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:01.080
<v Speaker 1>an answer to the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the particular situation.</v>

881
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.393
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of situations where a </v>

882
00:51:04.591 --> 00:51:08.790
<v Speaker 1>general answer doesn't suffice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say it is.</v>

883
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what's happened since the</v>

884
00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:15.290
<v Speaker 1>divorce law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott are liberalized.</v>

885
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.013
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you are going to be divorced and </v>

886
00:51:20.941 --> 00:51:21.774
<v Speaker 1>about the same rate as people would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been two years ago because rich people </v>

887
00:51:24.931 --> 00:51:28.260
<v Speaker 1>still get married and they generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get divorced.</v>

888
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Poor people do not get married and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like 60 percent of the population</v>

889
00:51:32.821 --> 00:51:37.770
<v Speaker 1>and it's ramping up quick and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence whatsoever that that's anything</v>

890
00:51:37.771 --> 00:51:42.690
<v Speaker 1>but catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So kids who are raised by single parents</v>

891
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.090
<v Speaker 1>do not do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

892
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.043
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean there aren't some </v>
<v Speaker 1>single parents who are doing a stellar </v>

893
00:51:48.421 --> 00:51:49.254
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously neurons and there's some </v>

894
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.680
<v Speaker 1>married parents to do a terrible job.</v>

895
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.693
<v Speaker 1>That's not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is the bulk of the evidence </v>

896
00:51:58.261 --> 00:51:59.094
<v Speaker 1>and the bulk of the evidence strongly </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests that children who are raised </v>

897
00:52:02.101 --> 00:52:04.560
<v Speaker 1>with two parents do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

898
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

899
00:52:06.511 --> 00:52:08.910
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to raise children.</v>

900
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're expensive,</v>

901
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.540
<v Speaker 1>they're troubleshooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>

902
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.420
<v Speaker 1>and they're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

903
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.680
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got them for 20 years.</v>

904
00:52:16.681 --> 00:52:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're going to do that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

905
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are near to be working at a horrible</v>

906
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:25.230
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty hours a week or more like a retail</v>

907
00:52:25.231 --> 00:52:26.064
<v Speaker 1>job for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just treat you like a slave </v>

908
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to go home to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable kids because I lost it.</v>

909
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not fun and you know,</v>

910
00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's increasingly the norm for huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of our population,</v>

911
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 1>like elitist liberal types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of you,</v>

912
00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:43.320
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pay much attention to what happens</v>

913
00:52:43.321 --> 00:52:46.290
<v Speaker 1>to people who were actually core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I can tell,</v>

914
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.090
<v Speaker 1>it's been a bloody catastrophe for them.</v>

915
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old saying when the upper </v>

916
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:51.944
<v Speaker 1>class gets a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower class gets pneumonia and you </v>

917
00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:56.250
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about that same.</v>

918
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.110
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

919
00:52:58.111 --> 00:53:00.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally the case.</v>

920
00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:02.370
<v Speaker 1>If an epidemic sweeps through a Barbie </v>
<v Speaker 1>relation,</v>

921
00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.800
<v Speaker 1>the population dies from the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

922
00:53:04.801 --> 00:53:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Awkward because they're so damn stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

923
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say with regards to marriage and</v>

924
00:53:13.141 --> 00:53:18.141
<v Speaker 1>I'd been married long time sister both </v>
<v Speaker 1>26 years now and I've noticed a bunch of</v>

925
00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:23.490
<v Speaker 1>things about marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is two brains are better than one.</v>

926
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So if you communicate with your partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not like you,</v>

927
00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have a corpus callosum </v>
<v Speaker 1>between you,</v>

928
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you things you don't </v>

929
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

930
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.050
<v Speaker 1>like when you're being stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:39.923
<v Speaker 1>in a typically feminine way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah typically masculine way or </v>

932
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.223
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid way you managed to be stupid to </v>

933
00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.200
<v Speaker 1>you and that can be really helpful even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's extremely annoying,</v>

934
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can help you make decisions and</v>

935
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 1>they're a good place to.</v>

936
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 1>They're good place to confess to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

937
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:56.094
<v Speaker 1>and it's really helpful when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to discipline </v>

938
00:53:57.691 --> 00:53:58.524
<v Speaker 1>children so that you're not a pathetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk saw who lets them run all over you </v>

939
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:02.784
<v Speaker 1>or some tire or who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to beat them with a stick when </v>

940
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 1>they sneeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

941
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.953
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you kind of find some pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle ground in there and it's a lot </v>

942
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 1>easier to do that with two people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one and then they can spell you off</v>

943
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:15.804
<v Speaker 1>when you're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly useful if you have small </v>

944
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:20.970
<v Speaker 1>children because you will be exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have small children,</v>

945
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the narrative of your life as </v>

946
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 1>continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's nice.</v>

947
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your home is set up properly,</v>

948
00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a pleasure to go to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

949
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:32.244
<v Speaker 1>it is that it is a buttress against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic and uncaring external world </v>

950
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:40.430
<v Speaker 1>because the external world in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give a damn both you,</v>

951
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you go home and it's set up </v>

952
00:54:43.561 --> 00:54:44.790
<v Speaker 1>reasonably well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

953
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got somewhere to belong.</v>

954
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 1>That's not so bad.</v>

955
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

956
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:54.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>related situation that as growth,</v>

957
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.130
<v Speaker 4>personal relevance for other people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

958
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

959
00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.910
<v Speaker 4>in many situations like when something </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad happens,</v>

960
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

961
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:03.864
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to do some kind of imperative </v>

962
00:55:04.461 --> 00:55:05.270
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

963
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.540
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so say it's like a health scare and go,</v>

964
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.190
<v Speaker 4>can I go work on my diet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's a divorce.</v>

965
00:55:10.191 --> 00:55:10.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

966
00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:11.474
<v Speaker 4>we want to go and work through why I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't think I was headed for divorce </v>

967
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.830
<v Speaker 4>for the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now it just happened.</v>

968
00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.660
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

969
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.793
<v Speaker 4>but in some situations people building </v>
<v Speaker 4>out repair but they don't want to get </v>

970
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.500
<v Speaker 4>them to actually be repairing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they go to people who are specialists</v>

971
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 4>in other areas of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of life,</v>

972
00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.213
<v Speaker 4>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological dealers and stuff like </v>

973
00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:30.830
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything but divorce,</v>

974
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.820
<v Speaker 4>like attention deficit work on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>scopes or like work on these,</v>

975
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.793
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like assertiveness training or </v>

976
00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like they're,</v>

977
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.140
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're diligently avoiding the heart of</v>

978
00:55:42.141 --> 00:55:42.974
<v Speaker 4>the methods.</v>

979
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And what was your major</v>

980
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.500
<v Speaker 4>and if you were in a family with </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like that,</v>

981
00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.573
<v Speaker 4>is there something like that?</v>

982
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:55:49.531 --> 00:55:52.610
<v Speaker 1>some situations are like Humpty dumpty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

984
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no putting it back together now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

985
00:55:57.511 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 1>in terms of avoidance of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

986
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:02.590
<v Speaker 1>like you think about that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

987
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.033
<v Speaker 1>Well divorce is a low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high impact solution because it just </v>

988
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:08.184
<v Speaker 1>tears a chunk of that hierarchy out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throws in the way that's a lot and it's </v>

989
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hurt you.</v>

990
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

991
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

992
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:16.523
<v Speaker 1>what might you do instead of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real answer is solve the damn </v>

993
00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>problems as they arise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

994
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard and it requires drilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

995
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 1>It really requires drilling down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I want to build,</v>

996
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:30.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't yet,</v>

997
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like going to be like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring thing that you guys do.</v>

998
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to build a problem solving matrix</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

999
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:40.020
<v Speaker 1>for compost because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the end,</v>

1000
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.000
<v Speaker 1>here's how not to get divorced from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

1001
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to set the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1002
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1003
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 1>really complicated and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to cook?</v>

1004
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 1>When are they going to cook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they cooking?</v>

1005
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 1>How should you respond to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who buys groceries?</v>

1006
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 1>What are the groceries going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to put them away?</v>

1007
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.243
<v Speaker 1>How do you say thanks when someone does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for you in the domestic </v>

1008
00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>environment and what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is part of the depth of God,</v>

1009
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the roles are gone.</v>

1010
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:15.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you better be </v>

1011
00:57:16.211 --> 00:57:17.044
<v Speaker 1>awake because it turns out that running </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kitchen in a house is unbelievably </v>

1012
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:22.684
<v Speaker 1>complicated and difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to negotiate how to do </v>

1013
00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it and you're a terrible negotiator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how to decompose the damn</v>

1014
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 1>problem to the point where you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve it.</v>

1015
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You won't admit what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't admit what your life,</v>

1016
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you won't pay any attention to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually irritates you.</v>

1017
00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd like to think that you're nice </v>

1018
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>and easy to get along with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

1019
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you're basically Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>and so until you realize that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even tell your partner what you want.</v>

1021
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And so this is where philosophy hits the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road or hits the ground,</v>

1022
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like trying to negotiate,</v>

1023
00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:57.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stable solution to how you're going </v>

1024
00:57:58.901 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 1>to run the kitchen because that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle between the sexist,</v>

1025
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:03.223
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two places where it really hits </v>

1026
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 1>one who's going to take care of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids to,</v>

1027
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.460
<v Speaker 1>to who is going to work in the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and under what circumstances.</v>

1028
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you figure those things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can consider yourself a philosopher,</v>

1029
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:26.903
<v Speaker 1>a very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cost for not doing it is low </v>

1030
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:36.520
<v Speaker 1>quality food in a hostile environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bratty children that you hate,</v>

1031
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:39.280
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility,</v>

1032
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.293
<v Speaker 1>the accumulation of insults at assaults </v>
<v Speaker 1>and either a divorce or really unhappy </v>

1033
00:58:44.411 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1034
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 4>but what did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just to take it back,</v>

1035
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.073
<v Speaker 4>what do you do when somebody has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to use a metaphor like has it </v>

1036
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:55.504
<v Speaker 4>helped care?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was like say the cancer </v>

1037
00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.193
<v Speaker 4>and then instead of quitting smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just started taking a multivitamin </v>

1038
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1039
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.633
<v Speaker 4>what do you do if you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody treat their smoking with an </v>

1040
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:08.490
<v Speaker 4>antibiotic was a multivitamin rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than</v>

1041
00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:09.623
<v Speaker 1>then you go to war three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding you tighten them into </v>

1042
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:17.250
<v Speaker 1>doing what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a war isn't just like you fly into a</v>

1043
00:59:17.251 --> 00:59:18.680
<v Speaker 1>rage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw dishes,</v>

1044
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.370
<v Speaker 1>explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful.</v>

1045
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.960
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1046
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you are not going to smoke anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

1047
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you have to do to do that?</v>

1048
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's your father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1049
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call you everyday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harass you.</v>

1050
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.013
<v Speaker 1>And if that doesn't work then I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come over and harassed and I'm going </v>

1051
00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:38.723
<v Speaker 1>to burn up all your cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to get your friends </v>

1052
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:42.194
<v Speaker 1>to come over and tell you that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody idiot and I'm going to put </v>

1053
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.250
<v Speaker 1>pressure on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your mom's going to help too.</v>

1054
00:59:47.251 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't quit smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to leave.</v>

1055
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's life or death.</v>

1056
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 1>What's it going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1057
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may say you don't want to go to war,</v>

1058
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you might also say that it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>your right to go to war,</v>

1059
00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.593
<v Speaker 1>but if you're faced with a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's someone you love is engaging </v>

1060
01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>in a behavior that seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive,</v>

1061
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:05.623
<v Speaker 1>it's like your ratchet up the pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they stop or you can't stand it </v>

1062
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>anymore and if you can't stand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

1063
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>lots of things are a war and so you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be prepared for a book like,</v>

1065
01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>because that's also a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with to say no,</v>

1066
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:24.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos got offended in a way to take it </v>

1067
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:27.194
<v Speaker 1>back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting is that like you got to </v>

1068
01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>find it in a way that you can continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have these battles so that it doesn't</v>

1069
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>just become a failed enterprise and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first conversation,</v>

1070
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.384
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can blow apart the whole </v>

1071
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and the personal do that to you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

1073
01:00:38.731 --> 01:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>they'll often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1074
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>you can quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't start biting me,</v>

1075
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to talk to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1076
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't be afraid of that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1077
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can also tell them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

1078
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>that's an inappropriate move.</v>

1079
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1080
01:00:55.101 --> 01:01:00.101
<v Speaker 1>don't bring up the nuclear bombs yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson and the will say,</v>

1081
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.813
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to get health tips from </v>

1082
01:01:02.921 --> 01:01:03.681
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the parent.</v>

1083
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you what's healthy to eat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1084
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1085
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.073
<v Speaker 1>That's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an entry level volume that </v>

1086
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you're the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1087
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1088
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a brilliant observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would say,</v>

1089
01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

1090
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>issues or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending my personal romantic sexual life</v>

1091
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.174
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not comfortable sharing things with </v>

1092
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1093
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Well you can tell them that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable living with the consequences</v>

1094
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:29.654
<v Speaker 1>of their stupid decisions and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck with it too because you know the </v>

1095
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>personal say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1096
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>this is me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1097
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1098
01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>except you're connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's connected to your mother,</v>

1099
01:01:39.201 --> 01:01:40.034
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're both connected to you and </v>

1100
01:01:41.211 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>they're all connected to their friends.</v>

1101
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1102
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1103
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:46.694
<v Speaker 1>if you're on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while even then it wouldn't just be </v>

1104
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be more of a use.</v>

1105
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's just weak argumentation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people will do when you're having a</v>

1106
01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>war with them is they'll have like 10 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 prepared responses.</v>

1107
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>They're always cliches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1108
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>and so you just back that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just cliche.</v>

1109
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:05.091
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1110
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>well first of all we're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cliches,</v>

1111
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.833
<v Speaker 1>but then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they get math and then they'll </v>

1112
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>stomp away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll cry.</v>

1113
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can get through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1114
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

1115
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

1116
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>But you got to think it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually care if you're parked,</v>

1117
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person is smoking themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1118
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Of course I love it.</v>

1119
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1120
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>sure you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1121
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>why is it important to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it work?</v>

1122
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Why does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it worth going to war about it?</v>

1123
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it and you have to be able to tell.</v>

1124
01:02:39.941 --> 01:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>But first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
01:02:41.361 --> 01:02:42.194
<v Speaker 1>and if you could tell them that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could really figure it out and you can </v>

1126
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:45.204
<v Speaker 1>really tell them that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll listen because they </v>

1127
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:48.984
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to know that they're </v>

1128
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>tearing you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1129
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to do everything not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see that it's my problem.</v>

1130
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I wish it wasn't a problem because </v>

1131
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 1>then I wouldn't have to worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately,</v>

1132
01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:03.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fortunately we're tied together at </v>

1133
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:06.264
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the barrel so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we better figure out how to deal with </v>

1134
01:03:08.581 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1135
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.073
<v Speaker 1>So it's very hard thing to do and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better to address those things </v>

1136
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.274
<v Speaker 1>before they become catastrophic because </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they've gotten to the point </v>

1137
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>where it's a 15 year problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Jesus,</v>

1138
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a very large tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1139
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:24.920
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1140
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:25.763
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Mesopotamian creation myth is </v>

1141
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that it tells you what happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>muck around,</v>

1142
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

1143
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.850
<v Speaker 1>because remember that Mesopotamian gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill app suit,</v>

1144
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the structure they all rest on.</v>

1145
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.053
<v Speaker 1>So it's just this sort of a hollow steel</v>
<v Speaker 1>shell now and the end now things alive </v>

1146
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and being fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's paying attention.</v>

1147
01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>What comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens on the longer that goes on,</v>

1148
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the monster that makes its </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance,</v>

1149
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:53.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could easily be in a situation </v>

1150
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>where the boxster that people are hiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>from his.</v>

1151
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 1>So Cam being you may not have the skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill it.</v>

1152
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1153
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:07.890
<v Speaker 1>even remember horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he goes off that off after I'm sad,</v>

1154
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>he loses an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's no joke,</v>

1155
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:11.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a god and he wins and he still </v>

1156
01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>loses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not So,</v>

1157
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's smoking,</v>

1158
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:19.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you may have to </v>

1159
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>confront is their absolute cynicism </v>
<v Speaker 1>about life.</v>

1160
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.353
<v Speaker 1>Seriously thought through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of reasons to be </v>

1161
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:30.780
<v Speaker 1>cynical about life and resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of hate and all of those things.</v>

1162
01:04:30.781 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1163
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the war that clear the head,</v>

1164
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to hit,</v>

1165
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find the monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the problem.</v>

1166
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And they're usually archetypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1167
01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:44.034
<v Speaker 1>I've been in lots of situations with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients where the only language that </v>

1168
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:47.514
<v Speaker 1>could be used to describe what was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on was religious because the problems </v>

1169
01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:51.594
<v Speaker 1>were so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's so good against evil that </v>

1170
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.710
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any other language that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>even close to powerful enough,</v>

1171
01:04:58.711 --> 01:04:59.544
<v Speaker 1>and that's usually what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>households where there's a truly </v>

1172
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>homicidal battle going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a deep full problem for example.</v>

1173
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And if were you in my personality class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch crumb.</v>

1174
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>

1175
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:16.103
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see psychological about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind you wouldn't see normally </v>

1176
01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:21.334
<v Speaker 1>unless you were a clinician and like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinician who was really into the </v>

1177
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:28.070
<v Speaker 1>situation crumbled Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's available online.</v>

1178
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:33.710
<v Speaker 1>You probably have to rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the pathology and that families</v>

1179
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:38.881
<v Speaker 1>are critical and it's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1180
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that made the documentary to the</v>

1181
01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1182
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they laid a band,</v>

1183
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were also nurse assistance.</v>

1184
01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like what a monstrous </v>

1185
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>animal looks like right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>

1186
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>He had like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this very large,</v>

1187
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.850
<v Speaker 1>like clean mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1188
01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.073
<v Speaker 1>it's was quite the creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was sort of like this monstrous </v>

1189
01:06:16.781 --> 01:06:17.614
<v Speaker 1>creature and so all of his restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sort of like it and so all of his </v>

1190
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:23.824
<v Speaker 1>drawings were like if these monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 1>like monster swimming with him as a </v>

1191
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 1>parasitical appendage.</v>

1192
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Freudian storyboard.</v>

1193
01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:33.623
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't looked at any pathological </v>

1194
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:38.160
<v Speaker 1>families because it's re.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's claim was.</v>

1195
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the first battle that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

1196
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>If you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a think about it.</v>

1197
01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's some battles you got to get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your mother to get to kindergarten.</v>

1198
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

1199
01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:50.394
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got to make friends </v>

1200
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:55.360
<v Speaker 1>that's bad enough to and then you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get away from your family.</v>

1201
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like in the eatable situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't win the first battle,</v>

1202
01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.013
<v Speaker 1>your screw and it's worse even because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you don't is because there's </v>

1203
01:07:06.281 --> 01:07:07.114
<v Speaker 1>something about one or both parents that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bloody well doing everything it </v>

1204
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>possibly can to make sure that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1205
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:14.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty dark.</v>

1206
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Who would ever believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you failed in your life in</v>

1207
01:07:18.131 --> 01:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>a serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1208
01:07:19.931 --> 01:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>and you're resentful and irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable about it.</v>

1209
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:27.310
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate your child's success?</v>

1210
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.293
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to stand to see someone thrive </v>

1211
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>where you failed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1212
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:35.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1213
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.153
<v Speaker 1>If you were that kind of safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have failed to begin with </v>

1214
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>no one in that particular away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1215
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>families can be just.</v>

1216
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Freud was a smart man and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watched chrome,</v>

1217
01:07:47.081 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you can see exactly what he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1218
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.564
<v Speaker 1>Some very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to get access to that </v>

1219
01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:51.634
<v Speaker 1>kind of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you happen to be in that </v>

1220
01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:54.154
<v Speaker 1>situation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're helping someone cope with it and </v>

1221
01:07:57.761 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you're really tied in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1222
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:04.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfect segue to the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

1223
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothesis here is that,</v>

1224
01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1225
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 1>what's complex hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothesis fundamentally is that</v>

1226
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>your basic ways that you break down </v>
<v Speaker 1>being as such,</v>

1227
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.510
<v Speaker 1>which I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1228
01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.573
<v Speaker 1>is represented symbolically by these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceramic tile forums that have the </v>

1229
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:25.244
<v Speaker 1>capacity to be spiritual or to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reveal the treasure because you're a </v>

1230
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>social primate and you sort of a nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

1231
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primate,</v>

1232
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>your primary cognitive categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

1233
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's male,</v>

1234
01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child,</v>

1235
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:40.063
<v Speaker 1>and the child tends to take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the sun like the male child </v>

1236
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we'll go into.</v>

1237
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:46.770
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1238
01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because of the overwhelming</v>

1239
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:50.294
<v Speaker 1>reality of the feminine throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>history has been the feminine in </v>

1240
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 1>relationship to procreation is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>defining characteristic of the feminine.</v>

1241
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you can define the feminine with </v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity,</v>

1242
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:02.174
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to define the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose relationship isn't primarily </v>

1243
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:06.403
<v Speaker 1>appropriative known as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't use feminine symbolism to do </v>

1244
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it complicated.</v>

1245
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:13.070
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example of that.</v>

1246
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:18.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that sound a herb roast chicken.</v>

1247
01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one of these up in my office.</v>

1248
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't any of you guys come up and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found?</v>

1249
01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 1>One in Mexico or actually someone found </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I bought it from them.</v>

1250
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not next to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1251
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.000
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly one of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool,</v>

1252
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 1>except it's got legs at the bottom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands out.</v>

1253
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's chicken with a snake wrapped</v>

1254
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 1>around its neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1255
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please wait.</v>

1256
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:45.280
<v Speaker 1>He's off to the side and on each wing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spider web,</v>

1257
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 1>which I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely perfect.</v>

1258
01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:48.254
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an archetypal image in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of something like you see in the </v>

1259
01:09:51.051 --> 01:09:54.590
<v Speaker 1>US too with the snake that the US often </v>
<v Speaker 1>used for.</v>

1260
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>The Americans often use that flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an eagle with a snake and it's</v>

1261
01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.453
<v Speaker 1>talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another variant of the same sort </v>

1262
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:01.034
<v Speaker 1>of assembled and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this combination of matter and </v>

1263
01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:04.550
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burden,</v>

1264
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 1>burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptile,</v>

1265
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and it does represent the ground of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being all things considered.</v>

1266
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:13.060
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that springs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these primary phenomenon,</v>

1267
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that's father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother child,</v>

1268
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.420
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those correspond to nature,</v>

1269
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.970
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1270
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.043
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing that mediates between the </v>

1271
01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 1>two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hero.</v>

1272
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not just the hero because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the adversary,</v>

1273
01:10:31.701 --> 01:10:35.480
<v Speaker 1>because the adversary is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>refuses to mediate between those two.</v>

1274
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's just as much part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual as the part that will do it.</v>

1275
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Those are logged in internal combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak now.</v>

1276
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:44.683
<v Speaker 1>But that's the first differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that </v>

1277
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.363
<v Speaker 1>that is how we differentiate the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we sprayed into consciousness and </v>

1278
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1279
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cake.</v>

1280
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like formless Keto Os.</v>

1281
01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>That's where you've come from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

1282
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 1>And then post you've got a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1283
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:06.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a primary reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have a father and you know,</v>

1284
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:11.120
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't have a father there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're a human being,</v>

1285
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:11.954
<v Speaker 1>you have a father because the father is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchal structure or the </v>

1286
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1287
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the inculturation.</v>

1288
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.493
<v Speaker 1>It's the embodiment of enculturation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be in you as you get </v>

1289
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>inculturated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's distributed everywhere in every</v>

1290
01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:25.934
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the rules by which people </v>

1291
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even just the rules,</v>

1292
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.473
<v Speaker 1>click the behavioral rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but govern our interactions and if you </v>

1293
01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:34.374
<v Speaker 1>don't incorporate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't become enculturated by the </v>

1294
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:39.900
<v Speaker 1>time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your you're,</v>

1295
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you're either new astrophe or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial and criminal.</v>

1296
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:45.443
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know the literature on anti </v>

1297
01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:48.484
<v Speaker 1>social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like basically what happens is </v>

1298
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:50.934
<v Speaker 1>there's about 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five to 10 percent of boys who are very </v>

1299
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and assertive and selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

1300
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 1>self oriented when they're two and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find them,</v>

1301
01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you just put them together with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year olds and there's this subset of</v>

1302
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're almost always boys,</v>

1303
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but not always who bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>

1304
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit and steel.</v>

1305
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And they just do that.</v>

1306
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is they're like top </v>
<v Speaker 1>little monsters and you know,</v>

1307
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:14.094
<v Speaker 1>they're out there asserting themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the tail end of a continuum </v>

1308
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's mostly agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disagreeable kids,</v>

1309
01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.780
<v Speaker 1>their toughest boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1310
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and they'll basically stand up to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not that easy to scare,</v>

1311
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

1312
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And so with them it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell should I listen to you?</v>

1313
01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And my son was like that and he was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he was nine months old,</v>

1314
01:12:34.511 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd stare me down like so impressive.</v>

1315
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 1>It's really soft and it's like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it so,</v>

1316
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1317
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.320
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either with the,</v>

1318
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>with the kids that are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't socialize them by the time,</v>

1319
01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:51.723
<v Speaker 1>therefore they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they then they can't make friends </v>

1320
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know how to play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>share and all those things.</v>

1321
01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And then they ended up outcasts and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1322
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:02.700
<v Speaker 1>puberty hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the testosterone rises and Poof,</v>

1323
01:13:02.701 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 1>they're in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and whatever you go on to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>inculturated.</v>

1325
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's the incorporation of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and some of that's,</v>

1326
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:14.123
<v Speaker 1>that's the Super Ego from the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective to some of that is positive </v>

1327
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:19.410
<v Speaker 1>because you bloody well better know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to share play games.</v>

1328
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.453
<v Speaker 1>And some of it's negative because one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that's so weird about having </v>

1329
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:24.234
<v Speaker 1>little kids is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you give them hell mostly for is </v>

1330
01:13:27.421 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 1>having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible,</v>

1331
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:30.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think you're always </v>

1332
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:33.600
<v Speaker 1>punishing kids if we do for breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

1333
01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And so on snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

1334
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming at the top with their guns.</v>

1335
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:40.110
<v Speaker 1>They're completely having a blast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>and they're destroying the house in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

1337
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but they're really having fun and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1338
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys settled out right now.</v>

1339
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're doing that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1340
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you bring the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

1341
01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tiers and the pavement,</v>

1342
01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 1>the frustration and the anger and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility under control.</v>

1343
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:57.953
<v Speaker 1>So they stopped having temper tantrums </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't hit you when they're mad </v>

1344
01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 1>or themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But get that all under control.</v>

1345
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.343
<v Speaker 1>Jesus regulate the positive promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just dampened it right down until </v>

1346
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>they can go sit with their 80 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother quietly,</v>

1347
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a real restricting process.</v>

1348
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's why half of the Greek father </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a tyrant.</v>

1349
01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1350
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:20.404
<v Speaker 1>like you hope that the whole damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a tyrant because obviously by </v>

1351
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:25.174
<v Speaker 1>socializing your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing them a great favor right </v>

1352
01:14:27.371 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1353
01:14:28.241 --> 01:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they learned how to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very useful.</v>

1354
01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 1>They learn how to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn how to play with other kids,</v>

1355
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:34.174
<v Speaker 1>so at the same time that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraining the hallow them and making </v>

1356
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.374
<v Speaker 1>them less than they were in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also opening up vistas to them </v>

1357
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that they would otherwise not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to.</v>

1358
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.813
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that's very bunch </v>

1359
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:51.550
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically die into your personality.</v>

1360
01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens?</v>

1361
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a Darwinian issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

1362
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Speaker 1>What are your first board of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons?</v>

1363
01:14:57.341 --> 01:14:58.174
<v Speaker 1>Have more connections than you can shake</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stick at like more than you'll ever </v>

1364
01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:01.474
<v Speaker 1>have in your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all the ones you don't use dye </v>

1365
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.943
<v Speaker 1>and so what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collapse of potential into </v>

1366
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.440
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's make no mistake about it.</v>

1367
01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:12.274
<v Speaker 1>It's costly because you become what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are instead of all the things that you </v>

1368
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 1>could have been and people experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a cost.</v>

1369
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:18.843
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of Peter Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to grow up because I don't </v>

1370
01:15:21.731 --> 01:15:25.000
<v Speaker 1>want to become one thing instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>many things I could be.</v>

1371
01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:26.043
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that theory is you get </v>

1372
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:28.114
<v Speaker 1>a whole right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't sustain your potential </v>

1373
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.673
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>

1374
01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't develop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just sit around and go stale.</v>

1375
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Curdles get salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not an.</v>

1376
01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not an acceptable choice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people make that choice all the time,</v>

1377
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 1>especially if they take the great father</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't anything but captain right?</v>

1378
01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:50.953
<v Speaker 1>A terrible heidrick tyrant who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of death crocodile with the </v>

1379
01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:57.424
<v Speaker 1>clock in its stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already got a piece of him and </v>

1380
01:15:58.711 --> 01:16:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dragon of chaos.</v>

1381
01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 1>He's being chased by the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

1382
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:04.123
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were terrified of the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos and you're in the patriarchal </v>

1383
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:09.154
<v Speaker 1>role and there'd be a tyrant and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell would anyone grow up to be </v>

1384
01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:13.294
<v Speaker 1>want to be like you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I see in my clients </v>

1385
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very often,</v>

1386
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.180
<v Speaker 1>and this is more characteristic of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>males and the females,</v>

1387
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.773
<v Speaker 1>is that many of them will not allow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells to experience anger or aggression </v>

1388
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.690
<v Speaker 1>or to express it because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical fathers,</v>

1389
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the things they decided </v>

1390
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>when they were like four was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never going to be like that.</v>

1391
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.221
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1392
01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:40.054
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work out because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the capacity for anger and </v>

1393
01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:43.804
<v Speaker 1>hostility and aggression and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have that at hand and you </v>

1394
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By refusing to manifest.</v>

1395
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.823
<v Speaker 1>All that does is cripple you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing half of your emotional </v>

1396
01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>dynamism and a whole chunk of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1397
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Know we don't have that many sources of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1398
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>You've got enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer,</v>

1399
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 1>good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

1400
01:17:03.281 --> 01:17:05.680
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for beauty.</v>

1401
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger is unbelievably useful,</v>

1402
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.000
<v Speaker 1>tremendous reservoir of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1403
01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:12.843
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to suppress that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to harness it so it's at hand </v>

1404
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.570
<v Speaker 1>so that people don't mess with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will.</v>

1405
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.773
<v Speaker 1>People will push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially pushing people and if you </v>

1406
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you can't push back,</v>

1407
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to walk all over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't even notice,</v>

1408
01:17:29.130 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll just move and they'll,</v>

1409
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.360
<v Speaker 1>they won't even notice that they pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>you over so when you will go home,</v>

1410
01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.213
<v Speaker 1>you'll be all resentful and irritated </v>
<v Speaker 1>who brewed on it for a month and it's </v>

1411
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:41.350
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't even have to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything at so.</v>

1412
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:42.733
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the man I've seen often will refuse </v>

1413
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:49.520
<v Speaker 1>themselves access to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anger in particular.</v>

1414
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:52.003
<v Speaker 1>And then with women it's often the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have a harder time getting </v>

1415
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>access to it because women are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable than men.</v>

1416
01:17:56.970 --> 01:18:00.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's harder for women to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1417
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:03.980
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for a woman even if she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn tough to really contend with</v>

1418
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:07.730
<v Speaker 1>the guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really difficult as guys who were really</v>

1419
01:18:07.731 --> 01:18:08.564
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're physically </v>

1420
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:13.190
<v Speaker 1>intimidating and super smart and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are very,</v>

1421
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:15.010
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.140
<v Speaker 1>because the cut you into pieces verbally</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they won't budge.</v>

1423
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:19.243
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to really ratchet up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your preparation before you can </v>

1424
01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>withstand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1425
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:25.383
<v Speaker 1>a lot of women here who are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with in corporate environments </v>

1426
01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and dealing with people who are tough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in and get prepared for that.</v>

1427
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some very,</v>

1428
01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:37.720
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very broad card people up there.</v>

1429
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing would happen without,</v>

1430
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are forced to contend with.</v>

1431
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos,</v>

1432
01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates itself.</v>

1433
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And did these fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say personified elegance,</v>

1434
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>but for Sondra fight is the wrong idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1435
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:58.280
<v Speaker 1>usually when you think of something as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being personified,</v>

1436
01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.133
<v Speaker 1>do you think of it as being something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you act as if it's taken on </v>

1437
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:03.960
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find Quality,</v>

1438
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a projection now.</v>

1439
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we naturally experience the</v>

1440
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:11.234
<v Speaker 1>world in the persona fight categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we have to take them apart to </v>

1441
01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:15.710
<v Speaker 1>get the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1442
01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:18.540
<v Speaker 1>look again at that differentiated world </v>
<v Speaker 1>out them.</v>

1443
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a baby,</v>

1444
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking the world is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

1445
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.633
<v Speaker 1>and then as you differentiate the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to turn into things that </v>

1446
01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:29.954
<v Speaker 1>aren't your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't like you confuse the world </v>

1447
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:33.560
<v Speaker 1>with your mother to begin with.</v>

1448
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:34.403
<v Speaker 1>It's modern world to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

1449
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:38.840
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1450
01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you're only this faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mother's really big and she's taken</v>

1451
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.550
<v Speaker 1>3 billion years to build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1452
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a force of nature to contend </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1453
01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:48.614
<v Speaker 1>And by thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by conceptualizing that entity as the </v>

1454
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:55.490
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done a pretty good job of initial</v>

1455
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.324
<v Speaker 1>modeling because think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually a reflection of the </v>

1456
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1457
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.473
<v Speaker 1>You really are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were shaped by the world in </v>

1458
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:05.720
<v Speaker 1>your evolutionary development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1459
01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>here's the world hears you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1460
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you're a little reflection of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world has made you.</v>

1461
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:14.303
<v Speaker 1>And so you embody it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is the sort of place where </v>

1462
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:21.300
<v Speaker 1>something like you can adjust to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you're a lot like the world.</v>

1463
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.373
<v Speaker 1>And so if you start out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the world is a lot like </v>

1464
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>your mother is actually a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption,</v>

1465
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:32.300
<v Speaker 1>it is pretty much like your mother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she is a force of nature and so it's not</v>

1466
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>personification is first pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

1467
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:36.953
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father comes into it in one form or </v>

1468
01:20:39.091 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1469
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>in a fractured for perhaps or a complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

1470
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the hope that you have a parent.</v>

1471
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:45.623
<v Speaker 1>Do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hope you have an architectural </v>

1472
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.213
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense who embodies that entire </v>

1473
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:50.754
<v Speaker 1>dynamic range of what it means to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gender because then they're a </v>

1474
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:57.240
<v Speaker 1>really good representative of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1475
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 1>most of the world that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with isn't stuff.</v>

1476
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.773
<v Speaker 1>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in so far as your mother and your </v>

1477
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:07.584
<v Speaker 1>father or the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good model because </v>

1478
01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone you meet is going to be your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother or your father roughly speaking.</v>

1479
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:15.443
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're very dynamic people and they </v>

1480
01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 1>embodied the full range of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

1481
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as one person can do that,</v>

1482
01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:24.053
<v Speaker 1>then they're excellent models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what you're going to be interacting </v>

1483
01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 1>with for the rest of your life and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what they should be,</v>

1484
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.693
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because on average what you should do </v>

1485
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:32.004
<v Speaker 1>for your children is be as much like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is you can be because that would </v>

1486
01:21:36.481 --> 01:21:37.314
<v Speaker 1>prepare them for the work so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be too nice because the world </v>

1487
01:21:39.841 --> 01:21:40.674
<v Speaker 1>isn't too nice and you shouldn't be too </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh because then you'll just crush </v>

1488
01:21:43.891 --> 01:21:44.724
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't be like making things </v>

1489
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:48.180
<v Speaker 1>easy for them.</v>

1490
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you should be making things.</v>

1491
01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:54.150
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for them as they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly manage and it takes a real.</v>

1492
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:55.103
<v Speaker 1>You really have to have a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a child will be able to do that </v>

1493
01:21:56.851 --> 01:21:57.684
<v Speaker 1>because you got to keep them in the zone</v>
<v Speaker 1>of proximal development and that to do </v>

1494
01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:03.200
<v Speaker 1>that you have to know what their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>and so if they can carry five following </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>

1496
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.860
<v Speaker 1>he put another ounce on Tuesday and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1497
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.870
<v Speaker 1>that way they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1498
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the anti eatable approach.</v>

1499
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:14.514
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to become strong and </v>

1500
01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:18.630
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very hard on parents to do that.</v>

1501
01:22:18.631 --> 01:22:19.464
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they define their lives by</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children because they will want </v>

1502
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:24.474
<v Speaker 1>the child to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing because you </v>

1503
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:31.510
<v Speaker 1>don't end up with the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ended up with a crippled monster and</v>

1504
01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the closet,</v>

1505
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

1506
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1507
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1508
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.930
<v Speaker 1>and the child obviously is there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the mother of the father and the</v>

1509
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>child whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the world.</v>

1510
01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.673
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what things break into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and I think our social cognitive </v>

1511
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:49.883
<v Speaker 1>primate brain operates that way and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it operates that way and there seems </v>

1512
01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:55.344
<v Speaker 1>to be plenty of evidence that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you might think </v>

1513
01:22:57.351 --> 01:22:58.820
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that is the right thing.</v>

1514
01:22:58.821 --> 01:23:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So since our brain evolved and mirrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

1515
01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.013
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about reality from Egypt on </v>

1516
01:23:10.291 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from China on the left,</v>

1517
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>that's actually on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually Osiris and isis,</v>

1518
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.320
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's so cool.</v>

1519
01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:21.154
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they emerge from the primordial serpent </v>

1520
01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The predatory,</v>

1521
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:32.520
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and promising chaos emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary archetypal things.</v>

1522
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:38.363
<v Speaker 1>No I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't give you much more </v>

1524
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:42.634
<v Speaker 1>information about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although because a couple of students </v>

1525
01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.790
<v Speaker 1>sent it to me over different spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1526
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.490
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't have the story at hand,</v>

1527
01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:53.910
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

1528
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:54.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now we're going to concentrate on </v>

1529
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 1>the fifth on the archetypes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

1530
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So this is femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1531
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a female a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a class,</v>

1532
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an architectural category.</v>

1533
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.473
<v Speaker 1>So we're investigating the nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and the use of the feminine as </v>

1534
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 1>a mode of representing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1535
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:15.604
<v Speaker 1>So this is a nice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like done by know drug addled </v>

1536
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:24.370
<v Speaker 1>hippies in the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they lived in San Francisco.</v>

1537
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Actually think they knew Robert crumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a.</v>

1538
01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:28.683
<v Speaker 1>He was an underground cartoonist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact I think crumb probably established </v>

1539
01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 1>a little organization that gave this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's named Ms Dot Gilbert Shelton.</v>

1540
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.553
<v Speaker 1>His start in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has these characters that are </v>

1541
01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:41.764
<v Speaker 1>three hippies and they're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with drugs in one form or </v>

1542
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have this cat,</v>

1543
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.713
<v Speaker 1>it's fat freddy's Cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they kind of liked the cat and the </v>

1544
01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:51.520
<v Speaker 1>cap has its own adventures and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

1545
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:52.383
<v Speaker 1>So the hippies had just sold a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine and they bought this little </v>

1546
01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:55.864
<v Speaker 1>estate in the country and so they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing their cattle there and it's </v>

1547
01:24:58.181 --> 01:25:00.580
<v Speaker 1>never been in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty interesting.</v>

1548
01:25:00.581 --> 01:25:01.414
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a funny cartoon because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had cats and they hate it when you </v>

1549
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:04.700
<v Speaker 1>move places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1550
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.250
<v Speaker 1>because they're all comfortable where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

1551
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you move to captain the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and it's like,</v>

1552
01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like the little rap that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in the new cage,</v>

1553
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:11.973
<v Speaker 1>that cat is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will just sit there and cry </v>

1554
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>because they will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1555
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.713
<v Speaker 1>But then they sort of loosen up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually they sort of master the new </v>

1556
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:21.250
<v Speaker 1>territory and it's very stressful for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cap.</v>

1557
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.830
<v Speaker 1>So dogs are much better at doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1558
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because they're pack animals.</v>

1559
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1560
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.140
<v Speaker 1>the hippie takes the cat out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows them the country.</v>

1561
01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the cat's not that happy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1562
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.273
<v Speaker 1>So it goes into this crouch which </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals actually do when they explored </v>

1563
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:38.523
<v Speaker 1>new territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you put a rat in a cage and it </v>

1564
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:43.200
<v Speaker 1>starts to move around it hunches down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1565
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of slinking through the undergrowth</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically so that nothing can see it.</v>

1566
01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So that's what cap will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the cat sniffs away,</v>

1567
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:52.630
<v Speaker 1>which is what a capital do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mostly old factory,</v>

1568
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:53.523
<v Speaker 1>like most animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then poof it encounters an anomaly </v>

1569
01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.693
<v Speaker 1>and that's already on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like an explorer exploring cat like </v>

1570
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:01.144
<v Speaker 1>this would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for half popped up already because </v>

1571
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.823
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

1572
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's preparing for what's lurking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the unknown.</v>

1573
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And then if anything just triggers it </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the edge.</v>

1574
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:12.100
<v Speaker 1>You've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever gone behind the cap,</v>

1575
01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.890
<v Speaker 1>like wit to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1576
01:26:13.891 --> 01:26:14.724
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's someone startled </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing will just explode into for the </v>

1577
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.680
<v Speaker 1>jump four feet in the air and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very amusing,</v>

1578
01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:21.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a little better off than the other </v>

1579
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take revenge on later.</v>

1580
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:27.663
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the cat encountered something that </v>

1581
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand and then runs up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adults.</v>

1582
01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:35.163
<v Speaker 1>And so the MP say the cap disappeared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and he says under the house and the </v>

1583
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:39.164
<v Speaker 1>cat says Ukiah too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd smell what I did and then it </v>

1584
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:43.694
<v Speaker 1>shows what it smells and it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's like it's got duck feet </v>

1585
01:26:46.461 --> 01:26:47.294
<v Speaker 1>and it's got a like deer antlers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a whole face and it's got a </v>

1586
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 1>skunk tail and it's like you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that thing doesn't exist,</v>

1587
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:59.060
<v Speaker 1>but then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1588
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:03.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to derive a first pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximation of what the what's lurking</v>

1589
01:27:03.171 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 1>out there in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad representation.</v>

1590
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:07.813
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got the properties of the skunk </v>

1591
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:14.240
<v Speaker 1>going to and a wolf and all these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Melbourne made it into one thing.</v>

1592
01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Now it actually is what's waiting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the bush.</v>

1593
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Now as you exploring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to differentiate that into </v>

1594
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:23.930
<v Speaker 1>sub categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

1595
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't start your knowledge at a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution.</v>

1596
01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start at a low level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>

1597
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got to come up with a low level </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution model that's accurate but not</v>

1598
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:35.474
<v Speaker 1>detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you have to do that is </v>

1599
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 1>because you bloody well better do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast because if you don't,</v>

1600
01:27:40.090 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sitting around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1601
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:42.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a deer,</v>

1602
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.970
<v Speaker 1>a wolf or a Fox?</v>

1603
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And the next answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the thing that eight,</v>

1604
01:27:47.121 --> 01:27:49.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a good,</v>

1605
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get quick and dirty.</v>

1606
01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's why kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why kids imagine monsters</v>

1607
01:27:55.221 --> 01:27:59.210
<v Speaker 1>all the time in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there aren't monsters,</v>

1608
01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:03.470
<v Speaker 1>well not in that particular gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kid is not that stupid.</v>

1609
01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:04.963
<v Speaker 1>It's wired up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what's out there in the dark and </v>

1610
01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it takes a lot of calming to make</v>

1611
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:12.230
<v Speaker 1>a chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because we have kids sleep in</v>

1612
01:28:12.231 --> 01:28:14.840
<v Speaker 1>your own bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not natural for kids.</v>

1613
01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what should happen.</v>

1614
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.013
<v Speaker 1>But as an evolutionary know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does encourage you to </v>

1615
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 1>dependents and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He at the cost of some trauma.</v>

1616
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.113
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can perfectly well imagine that </v>

1617
01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.390
<v Speaker 1>collective humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>150,000</v>

1618
01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:37.391
<v Speaker 1>years ago stayed in a pretty type heat </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were sleeping because that's a</v>

1619
01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:39.950
<v Speaker 1>lot safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're,</v>

1620
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're little and delicious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>edible.</v>

1621
01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.573
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love the cartoon because it's also </v>

1622
01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 1>a really useful illustration about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>

1623
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a fantasy operates automatically and</v>

1624
01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>regenerate these generic low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

1625
01:28:57.090 --> 01:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now here is,</v>

1626
01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 1>this is Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a Hindu goddess.</v>

1627
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1628
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:07.494
<v Speaker 1>did people invent gods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very weird question </v>

1629
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.273
<v Speaker 1>because the answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And NASA results will know because you </v>

1630
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>could also just as easily say that God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1631
01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you look at anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1632
01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it from a Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective or Friday and perspective or</v>

1633
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.093
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific perspective and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that tend to be very </v>

1634
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>destructive to religious thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically,</v>

1635
01:29:31.951 --> 01:29:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1636
01:29:32.971 --> 01:29:36.690
<v Speaker 1>well the image is there to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect you against death,</v>

1637
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's a substitute father.</v>

1638
01:29:39.811 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the Freud defined again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

1639
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 1>or that their religion was constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to aid in abet.</v>

1640
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.593
<v Speaker 1>Those are in those who are empowered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep all the peasants and the Lo life's </v>

1641
01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:49.830
<v Speaker 1>under control by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
01:29:49.831 --> 01:29:50.664
<v Speaker 1>like promising them happy ever after if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they behave or that it's just a </v>

1643
01:29:54.631 --> 01:29:55.464
<v Speaker 1>primitive scientific theory that should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be superseded now that we have more </v>

1644
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:00.870
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the alternative hypotheses.</v>

1645
01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's look at this image.</v>

1646
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.973
<v Speaker 1>So this is Kelly and she's a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Devour that doesn't mean she's bad by </v>

1647
01:30:09.391 --> 01:30:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means something to contend with.</v>

1648
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 1>She's like the tmf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't take her apart so that you</v>

1649
01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:16.764
<v Speaker 1>can see her because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you happen to know what this </v>

1650
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:23.700
<v Speaker 1>means because of your culture and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might not be able to see it.</v>

1651
01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So let's figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she has eight ladies.</v>

1652
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has eight legs expire?</v>

1653
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.350
<v Speaker 1>How do you all feel about spiders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1654
01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:35.363
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you feel like that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have these little spider </v>

1655
01:30:37.261 --> 01:30:38.550
<v Speaker 1>detectors on your skin.</v>

1656
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Those are basically cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the spider crawls along in the </v>

1657
01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:43.404
<v Speaker 1>spider detectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this creepy feeling and that's </v>

1658
01:30:45.501 --> 01:30:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you basically shaking your skin to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of the damn spider course.</v>

1659
01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that anymore because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a horse,</v>

1660
01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:51.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just kind of have this digital </v>

1661
01:30:53.461 --> 01:30:56.280
<v Speaker 1>feeling like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And spider can give you a good chomping,</v>

1662
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:57.533
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes that's actually </v>

1663
01:30:58.771 --> 01:30:59.604
<v Speaker 1>poisonous and that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also a spiker is an interesting </v>

1664
01:31:03.061 --> 01:31:03.894
<v Speaker 1>thing from a conceptual perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it spins a web and the web </v>

1665
01:31:07.741 --> 01:31:09.840
<v Speaker 1>catches things that aren't paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1666
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.453
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing that isn't paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention gets wrapped up in this </v>

1667
01:31:13.781 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 1>spider's Web and then it gets sucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>dry.</v>

1668
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's a spider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1669
01:31:18.661 --> 01:31:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So she's a spider now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiders are pretty cool too because they</v>

1670
01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:23.070
<v Speaker 1>can spin webs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1671
01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the web of faith by the way.</v>

1672
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the way with faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1673
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.370
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a,</v>

1674
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.940
<v Speaker 1>she's a spider and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well she's in this web,</v>

1675
01:31:32.941 --> 01:31:35.340
<v Speaker 1>but the web has made other fire that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1676
01:31:35.341 --> 01:31:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And then inside the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are skulls.</v>

1677
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:41.160
<v Speaker 1>So she's a spider that sits in a web of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and skulls,</v>

1678
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.860
<v Speaker 1>so believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you saw a spider like that,</v>

1679
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.073
<v Speaker 1>you'd be looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might screen first and maybe he </v>

1680
01:31:47.871 --> 01:31:49.850
<v Speaker 1>would run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you'd come back and look at it.</v>

1681
01:31:49.851 --> 01:31:50.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

1682
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I found a spider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a web of fire itself.</v>

1683
01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very attractive to you.</v>

1684
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:56.460
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't be able to forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1685
01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing about Kelly.</v>

1686
01:31:59.441 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>She's the bunch of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody well cannot forget about.</v>

1687
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And so you could actually even say she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a model of all those things that you can</v>

1688
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:07.714
<v Speaker 1>forget about.</v>

1689
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:09.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1690
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:13.120
<v Speaker 1>she's an attempt tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things you can't forget about.</v>

1691
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:14.853
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would you want to model those </v>

1692
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's because you bloody well better</v>

1693
01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:20.890
<v Speaker 1>remember those things or you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stay alive.</v>

1694
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you be dealing with?</v>

1695
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:29.911
<v Speaker 1>The things that you shouldn't forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one by one fires say or,</v>

1696
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:32.020
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or skeletons.</v>

1697
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.213
<v Speaker 1>Should you be dealing with that one on </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or spiders or snakes or should you </v>

1698
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 1>be dealing with that as a category?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1699
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.533
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to deal with things as </v>

1700
01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.224
<v Speaker 1>categories because that way you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve a whole bunch of problems at the </v>

1701
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:48.190
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1702
01:32:48.191 --> 01:32:50.080
<v Speaker 1>so you might say you do this all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1703
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:51.663
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go on log on online and you look </v>

1704
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:58.060
<v Speaker 1>at people who are having one advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>about relationships,</v>

1705
01:32:58.061 --> 01:33:01.240
<v Speaker 1>they want advice about relationships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1706
01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:06.241
<v Speaker 1>well really what they want is to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to deal with this female or this</v>

1707
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:11.680
<v Speaker 1>mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't ask that question.</v>

1708
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 1>They ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I improve my relationships?</v>

1709
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:15.603
<v Speaker 1>Which is that they're trying to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem of how to relate to all the </v>

1710
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:19.343
<v Speaker 1>set of all potential relationships right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now because maybe that's better </v>

1711
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:23.884
<v Speaker 1>information than exactly what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this particular male or female at </v>

1712
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:29.530
<v Speaker 1>this particular point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1713
01:33:29.531 --> 01:33:30.364
<v Speaker 1>often it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can understand why people push </v>

1714
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:33.521
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1715
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:36.010
<v Speaker 1>why not get the general answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>

1716
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 1>then you solve the whole class of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

1717
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the class of problems here?</v>

1718
01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 1>The class of problems here is the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>of problems.</v>

1719
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It's how do you conceptualize the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>of problems?</v>

1720
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a brilliant question.</v>

1721
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:52.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1722
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:54.520
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you can't.</v>

1723
01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's no commonality between all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things that constitute a </v>

1724
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

1725
01:34:00.851 --> 01:34:01.684
<v Speaker 1>maybe there is.</v>

1726
01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Well this is an attempt to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1727
01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So what else about the Kelly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got a sword for hair's on fire.</v>

1728
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>She also has a headband of skulls now </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like smells very much,</v>

1729
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:14.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they creep us out and there's good </v>

1730
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>reason for that because all things </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered,</v>

1731
01:34:18.011 --> 01:34:18.844
<v Speaker 1>you should probably avoid places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of sculpture because </v>

1732
01:34:21.971 --> 01:34:22.804
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to infer from that that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people like you died there and that </v>

1733
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:27.334
<v Speaker 1>might be because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that it's going to kill you just </v>

1734
01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like it killed all those other things or</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some illness or whatever.</v>

1735
01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:37.231
<v Speaker 1>It's like get the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even chimps don't like chip hands and</v>

1736
01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mobile chip bodies.</v>

1737
01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:41.283
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scuffle for us it's like well you can </v>

1738
01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 1>see it's death itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1739
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:46.444
<v Speaker 1>and it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an architect will assemble and </v>

1740
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't get accustomed to skull very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

1741
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.823
<v Speaker 1>So just got skulls everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes she has tons of a tire </v>

1742
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't think this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1743
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.770
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the predatory element.</v>

1744
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And the tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty fascinating thing,</v>

1745
01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:07.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like 12 feet long,</v>

1746
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:08.803
<v Speaker 1>five feet high and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a major piece of engineering back </v>

1747
01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and probably it will eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to put the timer is counting on.</v>

1748
01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.280
<v Speaker 1>County also indicates that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of those terrible awe,</v>

1749
01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 1>inspiring predatory things that lurk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest.</v>

1750
01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Of course this is an Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1751
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:33.020
<v Speaker 1>She often has this snake around her </v>
<v Speaker 1>waist and usually it's a Cobra Cobra.</v>

1752
01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:33.854
<v Speaker 1>Is there another thing that people find </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely fascinating like fire and </v>

1753
01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not in this situation,</v>

1754
01:35:38.241 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what she has wrapped around her instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her intestines.</v>

1755
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.733
<v Speaker 1>And you see how our bellies hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just gave birth to that unfortunate </v>

1756
01:35:46.971 --> 01:35:47.804
<v Speaker 1>character that she happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on and his intestines that </v>

1757
01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 1>she's eating right now.</v>

1758
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I fail to see how this symbol can </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect you from death anxiety,</v>

1759
01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite the contrary.</v>

1760
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would seriously evoke it,</v>

1761
01:36:04.210 --> 01:36:05.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no patriarchal protection </v>

1762
01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 1>here and I can't see how anybody could </v>
<v Speaker 1>use this to oppress the peasants.</v>

1763
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:12.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they could scare them with it,</v>

1764
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't actually how Kelly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

1765
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that that's a useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about it at all.</v>

1766
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

1767
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Kelly is something you made sacrifices </v>
<v Speaker 1>to now that's cool.</v>

1768
01:36:25.431 --> 01:36:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And because it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have had a hard time to figure it</v>

1769
01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of sacrifice.</v>

1770
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:30.644
<v Speaker 1>So there was this guy who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist in the 19 sixties and he </v>

1771
01:36:34.191 --> 01:36:35.990
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Arthur Kessler.</v>

1772
01:36:35.991 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the ghost in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>

1773
01:36:37.821 --> 01:36:39.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a book of consciousness.</v>

1774
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he pointed out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Motif of sacrifice seemed to be</v>

1775
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:46.130
<v Speaker 1>architectural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was universal,</v>

1776
01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.473
<v Speaker 1>it was happening everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the side effects of that was </v>

1777
01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 1>human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go onto row,</v>

1778
01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:52.883
<v Speaker 1>upset you can sacrifice a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves or captures or children because </v>

1779
01:36:57.201 --> 01:36:59.420
<v Speaker 1>the Carthaginians used to do that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

1780
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:00.343
<v Speaker 1>their own children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have them smile before they </v>

1781
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:05.620
<v Speaker 1>killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was brutal room.</v>

1782
01:37:05.621 --> 01:37:06.454
<v Speaker 1>But the Carthaginians they would commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide at the drop of a hat because </v>

1783
01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 1>their basic idea was if you screwed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're wrong,</v>

1784
01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:15.590
<v Speaker 1>time to kill yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no hope for you.</v>

1785
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:17.083
<v Speaker 1>So it's very common idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Japanese still practiced that </v>

1786
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:22.690
<v Speaker 1>before World War Two as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1787
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.180
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1788
01:37:24.181 --> 01:37:26.900
<v Speaker 1>so the whole idea of sacrifice pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn dark,</v>

1789
01:37:26.901 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1790
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.910
<v Speaker 1>and Kessler regarded it as evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human race was basically insane,</v>

1791
01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 1>like fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological manner that was not fixable.</v>

1792
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 1>So it was like the ultimate in original </v>
<v Speaker 1>sin and the theorizing,</v>

1793
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that was written,</v>

1794
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:42.404
<v Speaker 1>when everybody was all shorted out about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we are going to blow </v>

1795
01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:45.224
<v Speaker 1>ourselves up with nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that humans were </v>

1796
01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>basically insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a bad theory,</v>

1797
01:37:51.411 --> 01:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could even say we're,</v>

1798
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 1>we've been driven insane by the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being anyways.</v>

1799
01:37:57.470 --> 01:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>You make sacrifices to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're often blood sacrifices.</v>

1800
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Now that's kind of interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you might notice </v>

1801
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>about what Kelly represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might say is the predatory,</v>

1802
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 1>like almost diabolical site of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1803
01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:18.630
<v Speaker 1>the part of nature that's really working</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard at doing un is that it does seem to</v>

1804
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:19.464
<v Speaker 1>thrive on blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea here which is if </v>

1805
01:38:22.711 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you give the damn thing what it wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will leave you alone.</v>

1806
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 1>But there's more sophisticated idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>right beneath that.</v>

1807
01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:30.144
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens if you sacrifice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly because she turns into her office </v>

1808
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and her opposite is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1809
01:38:35.491 --> 01:38:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's benevolent nature.</v>

1810
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of nature that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalists believe it,</v>

1811
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:44.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like nature as French </v>

1812
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:47.004
<v Speaker 1>impressionists landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not mosquito mosquitoes and Guinea </v>

1813
01:38:49.741 --> 01:38:52.570
<v Speaker 1>worms and cancer and crocodiles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangrene.</v>

1814
01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1815
01:38:53.671 --> 01:38:54.504
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sunny day in that old growth </v>

1816
01:38:57.541 --> 01:39:00.510
<v Speaker 1>forest where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney dear,</v>

1817
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:02.910
<v Speaker 1>constantly around smiling at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1818
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and that's nature too because nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what gibbs and if you use the feminine,</v>

1819
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.033
<v Speaker 1>the feminine symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your mother is certainly someone </v>

1820
01:39:10.921 --> 01:39:14.310
<v Speaker 1>who can be an absolutely horrific forest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that often happens to infants,</v>

1821
01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:16.070
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chief,</v>

1822
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the bearer of everything that pulls you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into life,</v>

1823
01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:20.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her,</v>

1824
01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 1>her contact with you or her physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact or ability to play with you.</v>

1825
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:24.323
<v Speaker 1>The fact that she looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she feeds you directly </v>

1826
01:39:26.551 --> 01:39:27.384
<v Speaker 1>from her body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the whole opposite of </v>

1827
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Kali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destroyer,</v>

1828
01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 1>and they're both elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

1829
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:35.003
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason I think that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminine per se that came to </v>

1830
01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.473
<v Speaker 1>represent the destructive element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature as well as the positive element </v>

1831
01:39:41.941 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 1>is that men experience women in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1832
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:47.580
<v Speaker 1>As the disruptive element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

1833
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.773
<v Speaker 1>because men are always been rejected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and women are nature because </v>

1834
01:39:52.381 --> 01:39:57.381
<v Speaker 1>nature is what selects you to reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the answer for most women to most</v>

1835
01:39:57.451 --> 01:39:58.284
<v Speaker 1>men is you're a nice enough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way your genes should </v>

1836
01:40:01.411 --> 01:40:03.950
<v Speaker 1>propagate themselves into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's as harsh a judgment as could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be rendered.</v>

1838
01:40:07.290 --> 01:40:09.060
<v Speaker 1>If you watch chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1839
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:10.223
<v Speaker 1>which I recommend it because it's full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of great mother's symbolism is he's </v>

1840
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.920
<v Speaker 1>being described himself as someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so much of a loser.</v>

1841
01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.110
<v Speaker 1>He's not even in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1842
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not at the bottom,</v>

1843
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 1>he's outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1844
01:40:23.191 --> 01:40:26.160
<v Speaker 1>so he described himself as someone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1845
01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 1>especially him and his older brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was virtually impossible for there to</v>

1846
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:35.870
<v Speaker 1>even conceive of the idea that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might ask a girl in high school.</v>

1847
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.793
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that they would get refused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that it was inconceivable that </v>

1848
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:41.454
<v Speaker 1>they could even do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they were in the dominance </v>

1849
01:40:42.901 --> 01:40:43.734
<v Speaker 1>arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course from and who has a mother </v>

1850
01:40:45.961 --> 01:40:47.220
<v Speaker 1>to go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1851
01:40:47.221 --> 01:40:48.054
<v Speaker 1>all his females are like these extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically powerful bird headed </v>

1852
01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 1>goddesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less,</v>

1853
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:55.084
<v Speaker 1>and he construed themselves with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little word thing that's sort of </v>

1854
01:40:58.121 --> 01:41:02.620
<v Speaker 1>cowering at their feet and it's deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded and to wonder,</v>

1855
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.113
<v Speaker 1>given his circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder he actually did a </v>

1856
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>remarkable job of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of developing himself in a,</v>

1857
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.750
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a productive manner,</v>

1858
01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I think given what he had to go against.</v>

1859
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1860
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:16.204
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sacrificed to Kelby and you bring </v>

1861
01:41:17.651 --> 01:41:22.651
<v Speaker 1>forth its opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like I was once I thought,</v>

1862
01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:23.734
<v Speaker 1>I thought I understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I had come to understand </v>

1863
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:26.644
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I figured this out about 15 </v>

1864
01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:29.134
<v Speaker 1>years ago and it just blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blew me over when I figured it out </v>

1865
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:32.763
<v Speaker 1>because it had always been viewed either</v>
<v Speaker 1>as kind of an empath phenomenon or </v>

1866
01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 1>something that's pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1867
01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:39.423
<v Speaker 1>It's the most remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most remarkable </v>

1868
01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:43.114
<v Speaker 1>conceptual discoveries that human race </v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever made because what it meant was </v>

1869
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 1>we started to figure out that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave something,</v>

1870
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:50.194
<v Speaker 1>what it wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you gave something something of </v>

1871
01:41:52.241 --> 01:41:56.140
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can turn it into something that</v>

1872
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:59.710
<v Speaker 1>might be beneficial to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the,</v>

1873
01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:00.583
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the common towns of delayed </v>

1874
01:42:04.271 --> 01:42:08.470
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delayed gratification is a sacrifice.</v>

1875
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1876
01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.190
<v Speaker 1>the marshmallow experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1877
01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get these little kids,</v>

1878
01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.740
<v Speaker 1>you're tortured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1879
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:16.783
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1880
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you like marshmallows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1881
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:19.294
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you.</v>

1882
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the advice of the.</v>

1883
01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Now if you don't eat those marshmallows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to have more marshmallows.</v>

1884
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And so then you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the kids eat parched,</v>

1885
01:42:29.851 --> 01:42:30.684
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1886
01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.653
<v Speaker 1>And you got to admit those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about them to get the </v>

1887
01:42:34.001 --> 01:42:35.930
<v Speaker 1>damn marshmallows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1888
01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 1>So if there was an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1889
01:42:38.471 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 1>then those kids would have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1890
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:41.764
<v Speaker 1>So that's something to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because delayed gratification is not </v>

1891
01:42:43.781 --> 01:42:44.614
<v Speaker 1>always the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The environment has to be stable enough </v>

1892
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:51.550
<v Speaker 1>so that the probability that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>get what you've delayed for is high,</v>

1893
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're living in sheer chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fool to delay gratification.</v>

1894
01:42:55.241 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like eat the damn marshmallow now </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1895
01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:02.740
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like delayed gratification </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the solution for everything.</v>

1896
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's the solution.</v>

1897
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:06.723
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make the sacrifice now and the idea </v>

1898
01:43:10.571 --> 01:43:11.404
<v Speaker 1>is it will pay off in the future so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that in architectural </v>

1899
01:43:13.991 --> 01:43:14.824
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that you forego something of </v>

1900
01:43:18.451 --> 01:43:19.284
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a sacrifice you let go of it </v>

1901
01:43:22.090 --> 01:43:22.923
<v Speaker 1>and the deal is if you let go of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better things will happen to you in the </v>

1902
01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:31.060
<v Speaker 1>future and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other animal has figured that out.</v>

1903
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:32.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels maybe because they store </v>

1904
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:37.330
<v Speaker 1>knocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really believe that they.</v>

1905
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fundamentally an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1906
01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they generalize from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1907
01:43:44.171 --> 01:43:45.004
<v Speaker 1>They do act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they generalize from </v>

1908
01:43:47.201 --> 01:43:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't turned it into a concept.</v>

1909
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:50.703
<v Speaker 1>And so the concept here is the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted such that it hasn't </v>

1910
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:55.243
<v Speaker 1>tremendously destructive element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can barter with that </v>

1911
01:43:58.161 --> 01:43:58.994
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can flip it over into part of </v>

1912
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1913
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.860
<v Speaker 1>That's positive group will reveal </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1914
01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That's bloody brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably brilliant.</v>

1915
01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:12.191
<v Speaker 1>And there's even another element to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because let's say that all your,</v>

1916
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.570
<v Speaker 1>all you been getting from reality for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile is Kelly.</v>

1917
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.490
<v Speaker 1>It's all spiders and snakes and fires </v>
<v Speaker 1>and skull.</v>

1918
01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what's and and things that want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat you.</v>

1919
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:26.290
<v Speaker 1>You might think why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One answer is,</v>

1920
01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what it's like,</v>

1921
01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but then that's a problem because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just what it's like.</v>

1922
01:44:32.451 --> 01:44:34.730
<v Speaker 1>You know that the opposite is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1923
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:36.140
<v Speaker 1>well where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the hell is that?</v>

1924
01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it hard to get space for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is I reality is cannot be</v>

1925
01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:45.203
<v Speaker 1>contentedly that's one ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's like you're depressed and </v>

1926
01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.150
<v Speaker 1>hopeless like you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another answer.</v>

1927
01:44:53.130 --> 01:44:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You might be doing something wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>

1928
01:44:58.061 --> 01:45:00.160
<v Speaker 1>well what would it mean to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong?</v>

1929
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:01.783
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're hanging onto something you </v>

1930
01:45:04.571 --> 01:45:05.404
<v Speaker 1>value a little too tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one of your axiomatic </v>

1931
01:45:08.801 --> 01:45:11.440
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the thing that's at the top of your</v>

1932
01:45:11.441 --> 01:45:12.274
<v Speaker 1>damn value structure is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently outdated or pathological </v>

1933
01:45:18.850 --> 01:45:19.683
<v Speaker 1>such that if you hold onto it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get his rounds and </v>

1934
01:45:24.731 --> 01:45:25.564
<v Speaker 1>misery.</v>

1935
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you have to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice.</v>

1936
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's why the rule is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making sacrifices to Kelly,</v>

1937
01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:38.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't sacrifice the low quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>junk.</v>

1938
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 1>You sacrifice the stuff that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to you because if things aren't</v>

1939
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:44.444
<v Speaker 1>going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be that it's because you're </v>

1940
01:45:46.581 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>attached to the wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's interesting.</v>

1941
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:50.383
<v Speaker 1>That's starting to get very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that means that people are </v>

1942
01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:56.540
<v Speaker 1>starting to think maybe my attitude has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do,</v>

1943
01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.753
<v Speaker 1>something I can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it's not just the factual </v>

1944
01:46:01.281 --> 01:46:02.114
<v Speaker 1>nature of the external world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I can contend with and </v>

1945
01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.393
<v Speaker 1>dance with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if I readjusted my moral </v>

1946
01:46:07.641 --> 01:46:08.474
<v Speaker 1>Schema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profitability is kind of low that </v>

1947
01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:11.624
<v Speaker 1>Kelly will be there all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be pretty high that her positive </v>

1948
01:46:14.421 --> 01:46:15.254
<v Speaker 1>counterparts shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might be how do we </v>

1949
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.823
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the sacrifices that are necessary </v>

1950
01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:21.464
<v Speaker 1>to organize our schema of interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in behavior such that when we </v>

1951
01:46:24.861 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 1>implemented in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality shines since positive face on us</v>

1952
01:46:29.031 --> 01:46:29.864
<v Speaker 1>in order it's negative face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like that's incredibly complicated </v>

1953
01:46:33.291 --> 01:46:33.910
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1954
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's problem.</v>

1955
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Human beings being trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at animals for that kind of forever,</v>

1956
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:40.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't until they were human beings </v>

1957
01:46:41.331 --> 01:46:44.750
<v Speaker 1>that you started to get some conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1958
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>But then the other thing too is you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all doing that.</v>

1959
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:51.910
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been back going with nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fattiest</v>

1960
01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.193
<v Speaker 1>made some sacrifices right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe your parents are making </v>

1961
01:46:58.901 --> 01:47:01.360
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices on your behalf and what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed?</v>

1962
01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.730
<v Speaker 1>The bed is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be worth it.</v>

1963
01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:05.253
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that if you make the proper </v>

1964
01:47:06.581 --> 01:47:09.250
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you discipline yourself.</v>

1965
01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:10.533
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not to dilute with your </v>

1966
01:47:13.091 --> 01:47:16.720
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention and you wait.</v>

1967
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:19.163
<v Speaker 1>Your life will be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool because it might be </v>

1968
01:47:22.031 --> 01:47:22.864
<v Speaker 1>true and if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then none of this is illusion or </v>

1969
01:47:26.411 --> 01:47:29.380
<v Speaker 1>delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just low resolution.</v>

1970
01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.073
<v Speaker 1>First pass representation that smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know from a Piagetian </v>

1971
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:39.980
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1972
01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you do before you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1973
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.673
<v Speaker 1>act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the people that were making </v>

1974
01:47:45.811 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting out this idea.</v>

1975
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Do they know the idea is what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>by?</v>

1976
01:47:52.330 --> 01:47:53.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1977
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.200
<v Speaker 1>you're acting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dramatically representing you.</v>

1978
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that knowledge or it's a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge?</v>

1979
01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it the kind of abstract knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about right now?</v>

1980
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the immediate precursor to that</v>

1981
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.353
<v Speaker 1>you don't get from the phenomena to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation without running it through </v>

1982
01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:13.764
<v Speaker 1>some bodily representations and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama and this is so damn complicated </v>

1983
01:48:17.481 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.653
<v Speaker 1>you probably couldn't get to it until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had civilizations that were pretty </v>

1985
01:48:21.181 --> 01:48:22.014
<v Speaker 1>damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people thinking about this </v>

1986
01:48:24.001 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1987
01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:26.463
<v Speaker 1>so the person who came up with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have experienced it as </v>

1988
01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.120
<v Speaker 1>religious revelation.</v>

1989
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the nature of reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get this image,</v>

1990
01:48:34.331 --> 01:48:35.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of this multi armed goddess and </v>

1991
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:38.424
<v Speaker 1>it's inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in a way up and it's like </v>

1992
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.930
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying you.</v>

1993
01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:43.813
<v Speaker 1>You're gripped by it and you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation and part of the reason </v>

1994
01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you worship it is because the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is,</v>

1995
01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.373
<v Speaker 1>is you when its grip and no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's an idea behind that is </v>

1996
01:48:53.701 --> 01:48:56.580
<v Speaker 1>so powerful that you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>gripped by it.</v>

1997
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.900
<v Speaker 1>You should be unable to forget it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

1998
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stellar stroke of genius.</v>

1999
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.313
<v Speaker 1>It's a real revelation and it sets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole human race on the path to making </v>

2000
01:49:08.611 --> 01:49:09.444
<v Speaker 1>the proper sacrifices so that the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bugs and the insects and the </v>

2001
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:18.801
<v Speaker 1>snakes and the Tigers stay the hell away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a good thing.</v>

2002
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe now and then you know,</v>

2003
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:26.660
<v Speaker 1>the world's can so that it's beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us.</v>

2004
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if this would be greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

2005
01:49:30.361 --> 01:49:32.600
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked a question before my shirt.</v>

2006
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:33.763
<v Speaker 1>You got to it last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you can just directly stating when </v>

2007
01:49:35.791 --> 01:49:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you think of as an architect when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used the word</v>

2008
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>well that's</v>

2009
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.660
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

2010
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:51.303
<v Speaker 4>This is an archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your behavioral reactions to that </v>

2011
01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:56.613
<v Speaker 4>could also the architect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say it's the expression of </v>

2012
01:50:02.021 --> 01:50:04.240
<v Speaker 4>something that's at the foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge,</v>

2013
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:06.243
<v Speaker 4>so it's like an innate axiom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation and behave and it's </v>

2014
01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:14.260
<v Speaker 4>archetypes that make us human rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than lines or ants.</v>

2015
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:19.770
<v Speaker 4>We have human architects and those are </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that we can dispense.</v>

2016
01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.780
<v Speaker 4>They're built into us like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2017
01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.200
<v Speaker 4>jealousy would be an architect for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

2018
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:29.440
<v Speaker 4>It's an archetypal pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunger,</v>

2019
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.603
<v Speaker 4>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these things that are common to </v>

2020
01:50:32.081 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are more.</v>

2021
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.240
<v Speaker 4>They're more conceptual archives to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like,</v>

2022
01:50:36.450 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 4>like things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2023
01:50:37.841 --> 01:50:39.580
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fuzzy word,</v>

2024
01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.010
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2025
01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:42.843
<v Speaker 4>it has to do with the element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>idiation and action that are not merely </v>

2026
01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.510
<v Speaker 4>culturally constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say.</v>

2027
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.373
<v Speaker 4>Is it something like I'm in jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like there has to be a sub </v>

2028
01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:55.773
<v Speaker 4>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it also has triggered or </v>

2029
01:50:57.421 --> 01:51:00.830
<v Speaker 4>activated by something or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of all over again?</v>

2030
01:51:01.110 --> 01:51:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

2031
01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2032
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2033
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:06.383
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can answer that in some sense </v>

2034
01:51:07.921 --> 01:51:12.921
<v Speaker 1>by analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John would not be able to learn language</v>

2035
01:51:15.011 --> 01:51:17.800
<v Speaker 1>unless they had the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language at hand,</v>

2036
01:51:19.150 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to be triggered?</v>

2037
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Twins sometimes come up with their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

2038
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.350
<v Speaker 1>identical twins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll just create a life,</v>

2039
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:30.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a pretty powerful </v>

2040
01:51:31.511 --> 01:51:36.190
<v Speaker 1>language creating capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>

2041
01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:37.893
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's triggered because you're thrown </v>

2042
01:51:38.921 --> 01:51:41.350
<v Speaker 1>into an environment where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the norm,</v>

2043
01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:44.320
<v Speaker 1>but you can throw a chip in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work.</v>

2044
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:45.693
<v Speaker 1>Now what it is that makes people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are able to generate languages </v>

2045
01:51:51.730 --> 01:51:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that's complicated because partly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the right mouth,</v>

2046
01:51:54.991 --> 01:51:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you have the right timing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the right throat,</v>

2047
01:51:57.581 --> 01:52:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the right brain,</v>

2048
01:52:00.011 --> 01:52:01.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't,</v>

2049
01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly know what any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things mean.</v>

2050
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.750
<v Speaker 1>So we use the word archetype to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover rate in roots in some sense.</v>

2051
01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Does the human psychological element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypes in your views change?</v>

2052
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.653
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>change qualitatively when human beings </v>

2053
01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.870
<v Speaker 4>are having widespread access to board </v>
<v Speaker 4>presentations?</v>

2054
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise it wouldn't be any.</v>

2055
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:29.520
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be any utility in </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your representations.</v>

2056
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the question you're asking in</v>

2057
01:52:32.551 --> 01:52:37.551
<v Speaker 1>some senses is representation useful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is so far so good,</v>

2058
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

2059
01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.950
<v Speaker 1>but just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the thing itself,</v>

2060
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:44.813
<v Speaker 1>once represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that representation and now filter </v>

2061
01:52:46.521 --> 01:52:48.550
<v Speaker 1>back in and then change this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>started out.</v>

2062
01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would say it doesn't happen all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ways.</v>

2063
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:52.723
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways the dominance hierarchy is </v>

2064
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.430
<v Speaker 1>a way that animals organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an environment,</v>

2065
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but if they do that long enough it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the environment,</v>

2066
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once it's,</v>

2067
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:06.830
<v Speaker 1>once the adaptation is being there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million years,</v>

2068
01:53:06.831 --> 01:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer an outpatient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the environment.</v>

2069
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's loops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causal loops happening everywhere.</v>

2070
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:14.263
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation changes the </v>

2071
01:53:16.431 --> 01:53:18.170
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how.</v>

2072
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 1>And over what period of time.</v>

2073
01:53:20.290 --> 01:53:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2074
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:26.583
<v Speaker 1>there is a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know enough about Hinduism </v>

2075
01:53:30.231 --> 01:53:32.630
<v Speaker 1>to tell you what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2076
01:53:32.631 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert on Hinduism,</v>

2077
01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.640
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated religious system,</v>

2078
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2079
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I do know that these sub dailies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

2080
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 1>are manifestations of the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality when there's many,</v>

2081
01:53:46.610 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>there's some utility in that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2082
01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:51.830
<v Speaker 1>it's monotheistic at one level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis and polytheistic and another,</v>

2083
01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.800
<v Speaker 1>it makes it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2084
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.673
<v Speaker 1>you could think about these as bridges </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the human and the absolute </v>

2085
01:53:58.521 --> 01:54:01.610
<v Speaker 1>divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute divine so damn abstract and</v>

2086
01:54:01.611 --> 01:54:04.460
<v Speaker 1>distant that it's hard to have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with it.</v>

2087
01:54:04.461 --> 01:54:07.800
<v Speaker 1>You need intermediary structures and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>saints are like that.</v>

2088
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2089
01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.420
<v Speaker 1>because they're sort of God's roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

2090
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:12.254
<v Speaker 1>but they're sort of human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you could kind of understand </v>

2091
01:54:13.671 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 1>them and their fractionated out and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only representative of the day,</v>

2092
01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not the whole thing all at </v>

2093
01:54:20.031 --> 01:54:22.150
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit much to contend with.</v>

2094
01:54:22.590 --> 01:54:23.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think having diverse vocabulary </v>

2095
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:32.870
<v Speaker 1>of health people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it helps it.</v>

2096
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2097
01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it helps them differentiated now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2098
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:45.643
<v Speaker 1>And articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we want to think about what that </v>

2099
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:49.260
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2100
01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.113
<v Speaker 1>So I think I've told you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen children that haven't been </v>

2101
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:56.000
<v Speaker 1>played up with enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they're five or six and they're</v>

2102
01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:59.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like little Frankenstein,</v>

2103
01:54:59.150 --> 01:54:59.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of uninformed and kind of </v>

2104
01:55:01.821 --> 01:55:06.140
<v Speaker 1>cloudy and clueless and they bump into </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like other kids,</v>

2105
01:55:06.141 --> 01:55:07.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>

2106
01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 1>they're not articulated well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the other kids usually won't play</v>

2107
01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 1>with them because they're sort of that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old level of development when</v>

2108
01:55:14.601 --> 01:55:16.300
<v Speaker 1>they should be at a six year old devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>of development.</v>

2109
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Just puts the other kids off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2110
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:22.730
<v Speaker 1>they find it creepy and there's reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that that I won't go into.</v>

2111
01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But those kids aren't differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2112
01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:30.140
<v Speaker 1>they haven't got the extremely high </v>
<v Speaker 1>level movements down.</v>

2113
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And so as you articulate an archetype </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it diversifies,</v>

2114
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you become more adapted to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

2115
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:41.623
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take the damn archetype and </v>

2116
01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:47.190
<v Speaker 1>differentiated like mad because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

2117
01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:48.024
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to see only the </v>

2118
01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2119
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd be on your knees if that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

2120
01:55:55.201 --> 01:55:57.220
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of men like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really are.</v>

2121
01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It's animal possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more common than you think.</v>

2122
01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I see this with male clients all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2123
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:02.843
<v Speaker 1>If they're attracted to a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mere presence is so god damn </v>

2124
01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:05.874
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming that it just ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about the naughts and </v>

2125
01:56:07.891 --> 01:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is they're not seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual.</v>

2126
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing the archetype and </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype is life is just too much.</v>

2127
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is the archetype does</v>

2128
01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>shine through the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real,</v>

2129
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:22.583
<v Speaker 1>but the individual part is real too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless the guy is capable of </v>

2130
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.293
<v Speaker 1>differentiating the archetype into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual woman to woman won't have </v>

2131
01:56:30.901 --> 01:56:31.734
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with him or maybe she'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with them like a spider plays with </v>

2132
01:56:34.261 --> 01:56:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the fly and it serves them right too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2133
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but so you have to have both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2134
01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Sleeping Beauty,</v>

2135
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the Disney movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how the,</v>

2136
01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:49.080
<v Speaker 1>the hero is put into a castle by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil queen,</v>

2137
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sleeping beauty is sleeping.</v>

2138
01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:53.443
<v Speaker 1>And so then he has to fight his way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this architectural </v>

2139
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:56.424
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually transforms itself into </v>

2140
01:56:58.771 --> 01:56:59.604
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to fight his way all through all </v>

2141
01:57:01.921 --> 01:57:05.430
<v Speaker 1>of that before it can actually get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real woman.</v>

2142
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens with men</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they develop poor,</v>

2143
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.990
<v Speaker 1>failed to develop is the first thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that they're immature.</v>

2144
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:12.833
<v Speaker 1>All they see is the archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very inferior in </v>

2145
01:57:15.191 --> 01:57:18.120
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the archetype because </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they were Christ,</v>

2146
01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:20.910
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're going to be at.</v>

2147
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be on their needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to contend with,</v>

2148
01:57:24.931 --> 01:57:25.764
<v Speaker 1>the archetype means first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to elevate the mail because as he </v>

2149
01:57:28.921 --> 01:57:30.480
<v Speaker 1>contends with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he develops,</v>

2150
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at it also means to,</v>

2151
01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:34.093
<v Speaker 1>to to place the two equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the archetype turns into the </v>

2152
01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:39.204
<v Speaker 1>individual woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a big sacrifice because you </v>

2153
01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:43.260
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

2154
01:57:43.261 --> 01:57:44.094
<v Speaker 1>you rather have sleeping beauty that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend princess in some actual woman </v>

2155
01:57:47.281 --> 01:57:48.114
<v Speaker 1>with all her trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is there isn't sleeping </v>

2156
01:57:50.311 --> 01:57:53.430
<v Speaker 1>beauty that pretending princess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just the real woman.</v>

2157
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And you see that with Peter Pan to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

2158
01:57:56.041 --> 01:57:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Because he's got tinker bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

2159
01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 1>except for Tinkerbell to ferry and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist,</v>

2160
01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 1>so he could have wendy if he would grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2161
01:58:03.541 --> 01:58:04.374
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't want to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not going to get Wendy's just </v>

2162
01:58:06.451 --> 01:58:10.740
<v Speaker 1>been in state king of the bloody lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys and that will be the end of that.</v>

2163
01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's differentiation of architects </v>

2164
01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're doing as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop across time.</v>

2165
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a book called the origins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and history of consciousness,</v>

2166
01:58:21.211 --> 01:58:25.350
<v Speaker 1>which was written by a guy named Eric </v>
<v Speaker 1>normand and it's a book that's very much</v>

2167
01:58:25.351 --> 01:58:26.184
<v Speaker 1>like maps are being because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that NASA meeting has been written four </v>

2168
01:58:28.561 --> 01:58:30.080
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2169
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:31.663
<v Speaker 1>it's symbols of transformation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth that it's origins and history of </v>

2170
01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:37.230
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Norman,</v>

2171
01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:41.860
<v Speaker 1>who was a student of young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote that and it's also Becker's denial</v>

2172
01:58:41.861 --> 01:58:42.694
<v Speaker 1>of death and it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's elements and heidegger are </v>

2173
01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:49.840
<v Speaker 1>very similar because all that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the same problem.</v>

2174
01:58:49.841 --> 01:58:52.720
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's lovely </v>
<v Speaker 1>about knowing that he's very smart about</v>

2175
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.583
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he describes the acquisition of </v>

2176
01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>knowledge as the differentiation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes.</v>

2177
01:58:59.470 --> 01:59:01.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right,</v>

2178
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:01.893
<v Speaker 1>it's like the thing itself is a unified </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole that sort of the divine ground of </v>

2179
01:59:05.891 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

2180
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Then it fragments into the first three </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers,</v>

2181
01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and Chai,</v>

2182
01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:14.523
<v Speaker 1>and then that fragments and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does is fragments right down to </v>

2183
01:59:17.321 --> 01:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>the level of individuals so that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with someone,</v>

2184
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.273
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting to their with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual expression of the archetypal </v>

2185
01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:25.444
<v Speaker 1>reality because then you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the person and that'll </v>

2186
01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.453
<v Speaker 1>get you a lot farther in any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship than being blown over by </v>

2187
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:38.281
<v Speaker 1>the architect project or would it be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you project them.</v>

2188
01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2189
01:59:43.181 --> 01:59:44.014
<v Speaker 1>That's how you see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the default because it projection </v>

2190
01:59:48.131 --> 01:59:50.440
<v Speaker 1>implies that you could be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

2191
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything you see is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>

2192
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Although some of them are differentiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can become extremely </v>

2193
01:59:58.271 --> 02:00:01.480
<v Speaker 1>differentiated in so far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to know a person,</v>

2194
02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're reading I to get differentiate</v>

2195
02:00:04.331 --> 02:00:05.164
<v Speaker 1>the damn thing down to the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual recognition and you're so </v>

2196
02:00:07.811 --> 02:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>skilled at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the archetypal reality reestablishes</v>

2197
02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>itself and then you get to have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cake and eat it too.</v>

2198
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:14.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you can </v>

2199
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:17.223
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because marriage is a human universal </v>

2200
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>vitally something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2201
02:00:22.810 --> 02:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>so it looks like it's built into us </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard at a biological level.</v>

2202
02:00:26.590 --> 02:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>So there's variations obviously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

2203
02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>there are certain attractions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

2204
02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>especially for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all things considered,</v>

2205
02:00:34.330 --> 02:00:35.163
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you looked in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's generally an attempt by the </v>

2206
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:38.764
<v Speaker 1>culture to st a man that woman pair now </v>
<v Speaker 1>young was trying to figure out why the </v>

2207
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>hell that would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the biological necessity.</v>

2208
02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:46.864
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you've gotten raised kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow and there shouldn't just be one </v>

2209
02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:49.774
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to just reduce </v>

2210
02:00:51.521 --> 02:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>everything down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2211
02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>to the level of two rats living </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2212
02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>even though that's an important level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and know.</v>

2213
02:00:58.751 --> 02:00:59.584
<v Speaker 1>He said that one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really useful about evolve is that you </v>

2214
02:01:03.491 --> 02:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>can't run away from the damn thing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an actual viable.</v>

2215
02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So what you're supposed to do when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>marry someone is you say,</v>

2216
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:10.114
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck with you and we're going to </v>

2217
02:01:13.810 --> 02:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>bet on this because we only get five </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots at it anyways,</v>

2218
02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.193
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the least awful person I've come </v>

2219
02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:19.414
<v Speaker 1>across and so let's tie ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>together so we cannot escape and see </v>

2220
02:01:23.171 --> 02:01:24.004
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think if you take that </v>

2221
02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

2222
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:29.103
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck with this damn person for the </v>

2223
02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

2224
02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really can't escape,</v>

2225
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:38.763
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2226
02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:39.813
<v Speaker 1>keep better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build something out of this because </v>

2227
02:01:41.061 --> 02:01:41.894
<v Speaker 1>we're stuck in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't conceptualize the </v>

2228
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:44.684
<v Speaker 1>marriage as an all chemical containers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he derived this from the studies on </v>

2229
02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>alchemy where two opposite substances </v>
<v Speaker 1>were placed together in a container they</v>

2230
02:01:53.511 --> 02:01:58.511
<v Speaker 1>could not escape from and then exposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to heat and the heat,</v>

2231
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>the relationship obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the emotions,</v>

2232
02:02:00.741 --> 02:02:01.574
<v Speaker 1>but the relationship generates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're exposed to heat and they can't </v>

2233
02:02:03.501 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>get out of the damn container.</v>

2234
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2235
02:02:06.061 --> 02:02:06.894
<v Speaker 1>there's a transmutation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transmutation is a consequence of the </v>

2236
02:02:10.791 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>exchange of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2237
02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>and we know this works at a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

2238
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:15.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason that there is sex </v>

2239
02:02:18.141 --> 02:02:18.974
<v Speaker 1>is because if we split your DNA down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and that it's something that's </v>

2240
02:02:22.011 --> 02:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>exactly to say wherever there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness,</v>

2241
02:02:24.891 --> 02:02:25.724
<v Speaker 1>the two weaknesses are going to combine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to end up with </v>

2242
02:02:27.921 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all mocked up.</v>

2243
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Now that's basically a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inbreeding.</v>

2244
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So what you want to do is you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take your applaud genetic substance,</v>

2245
02:02:37.011 --> 02:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2246
02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>99 point nine percent good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone else's blog,</v>

2247
02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>genetic substances snap them together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hope like hell that the errors don't</v>

2248
02:02:45.351 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>match up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they probably won't.</v>

2249
02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you're doing in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

2250
02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:49.874
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you're screwing somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cap ex and so is the other person.</v>

2252
02:02:53.130 --> 02:02:53.963
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you slap those two things </v>

2253
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 1>together and you hope that I'll of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you build in totality.</v>

2254
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that starts the information flow </v>

2255
02:03:00.381 --> 02:03:01.214
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is what would you </v>

2256
02:03:04.761 --> 02:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>do if the information flow was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>curator?</v>

2257
02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to you?</v>

2258
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're 20 percent work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2259
02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.510
<v Speaker 1>which is taste pretty good and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner's 20 percent more to,</v>

2260
02:03:17.511 --> 02:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>but our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily you're warps.</v>

2261
02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:19.624
<v Speaker 1>Don't match up what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to each other over a long </v>

2262
02:03:23.661 --> 02:03:26.150
<v Speaker 1>enough period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really communicated,</v>

2263
02:03:26.151 --> 02:03:28.730
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't be warped anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neither would the other person.</v>

2264
02:03:28.731 --> 02:03:29.564
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd have the archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation as well as the individual </v>

2265
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2266
02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.513
<v Speaker 1>You see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you both have been elevated up </v>

2267
02:03:36.591 --> 02:03:39.860
<v Speaker 1>to the point where you're not full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>holes anymore.</v>

2268
02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:41.503
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's part of the purpose in so </v>

2269
02:03:42.441 --> 02:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>far as there's this psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual function of marriage.</v>

2270
02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.320
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can,</v>

2271
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you can have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

2272
02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>well this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that we can untie,</v>

2273
02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with the person then.</v>

2274
02:03:57.570 --> 02:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get.</v>

2275
02:03:58.700 --> 02:03:59.533
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to take it as if it's </v>

2276
02:04:02.901 --> 02:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is it is,</v>

2277
02:04:05.551 --> 02:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it is life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2278
02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:08.593
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can have another shot at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why you think you'll do </v>

2279
02:04:10.761 --> 02:04:13.640
<v Speaker 1>better the second time because all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence suggests that you won't.</v>

2280
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:15.710
<v Speaker 1>The divorce rate higher for second </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages.</v>

2281
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:17.343
<v Speaker 1>So like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about being tied to someone </v>

2282
02:04:19.701 --> 02:04:20.534
<v Speaker 1>who isn't you is that they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have something to tell you if you </v>

2283
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:26.264
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you start with the flawed </v>

2284
02:04:27.861 --> 02:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>individual and if you're paying yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>against each other enough,</v>

2285
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>what you hope is that you both develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you shared your excess baggage along</v>

2286
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can happen.</v>

2287
02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing if it happens.</v>

2288
02:04:40.921 --> 02:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a better life,</v>

2289
02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:44.173
<v Speaker 1>the situation for your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody wins in that </v>

2290
02:04:46.561 --> 02:04:47.790
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2291
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all getting restless,</v>

2292
02:04:54.490 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>so let's stop and come back and come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 10 minutes.</v>
