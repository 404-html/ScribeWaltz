WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's some other ideas that,</v>

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.343
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>so here's an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you think about this,</v>

5
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:28.454
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought about it as an </v>

6
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 2>argument by necessity for evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if the,</v>

7
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>if the environment as such is too </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex to predict,</v>

8
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.553
<v Speaker 2>then how do you build anything that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in it because living in the </v>

9
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 2>environment is the same as predicting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

10
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:45.614
<v Speaker 2>It's the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's think about that for a </v>

11
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first answer is it doesn't work very</v>

12
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 2>well because you guys have been last </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat 80 years and that'll be that.</v>

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>So in so far as you are a solution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of the environment,</v>

14
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.793
<v Speaker 2>you're a pretty temporary one and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much the best that our path and </v>

15
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>evolution could cobble together in 3 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion years.</v>

16
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>So that just shows you how complex the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.693
<v Speaker 2>The other issue is that maybe there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no other mechanism then the Darwinian </v>

18
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 2>mechanism to account for any success </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

19
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.873
<v Speaker 2>Because the basic idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you cobble something together and </v>

20
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 2>is it good enough for the environment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is probably not.</v>

21
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 2>So you make a million variants and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that aren't any good die,</v>

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's evolution by an excess of death.</v>

23
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.673
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally it's you solved the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem by failing brutally generation </v>

24
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:38.474
<v Speaker 2>after generation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see how the problem could be </v>

25
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.004
<v Speaker 2>solved in any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the answer to the question is the </v>

26
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>environment predictable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

27
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.473
<v Speaker 2>because then failure is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative to failure the best you can </v>

28
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>ever get as temporary success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

29
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 2>you can chew on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a,</v>

30
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.023
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a couple other things here as you </v>

31
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 2>have to accept some propositions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this argument to go forward and actually</v>

32
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 2>laying out the propositions is the hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

33
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.404
<v Speaker 2>So one of the propositions I offered you</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you look at the world through a </v>

34
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:18.664
<v Speaker 2>frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that frame of reference is both </v>

35
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic and narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can debate both of those.</v>

36
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>You could debate about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frame of references,</v>

37
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.513
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I can tell you about that is when </v>

38
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I've gone through the animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience literature,</v>

39
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 2>the people who I thought were most </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed,</v>

40
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.510
<v Speaker 2>broadly informed about psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>general psychopharmacology,</v>

41
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>neuroanatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional neuroanatomy,</v>

42
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really hard end of,</v>

43
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 2>of the biological sciences that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant to psychology,</v>

44
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 2>their models are cybernetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of interesting.</v>

45
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.244
<v Speaker 2>And then the next interesting thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cybernetic models were designed by </v>

46
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.514
<v Speaker 2>people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were the founders of artificial </v>

47
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.304
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

48
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's an interesting parallel </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

49
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of the great personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories are cybernetic.</v>

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget's theory is basically a </v>

51
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.874
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so perhaps the cybernetic theories </v>

52
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>are not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

53
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.083
<v Speaker 2>But they're pretty damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to rest on that for the </v>

54
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>time being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next question is,</v>

55
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.124
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it reasonable to propose that the </v>

56
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>fundamental cybernetic frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his narrative,</v>

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.143
<v Speaker 2>and I would say pretty much none of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorizes except for maybe piaget who </v>

58
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.114
<v Speaker 2>have a cybernetic model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have drawn a relationship between </v>

59
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>narrative and cybernetic models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's why.</v>

60
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.564
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Gray who was credibly </v>

61
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.314
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well educated psychologist really are </v>

62
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.323
<v Speaker 2>outstanding scholar in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he derived his cybernetic models from </v>

63
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.874
<v Speaker 2>Russian cybernetic models that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the presupposition that what </v>

64
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.784
<v Speaker 2>you do when you move in the world is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>compare the current state of the world </v>

65
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 2>to the state you expect.</v>

66
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.923
<v Speaker 2>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong in an important way because </v>

68
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.034
<v Speaker 2>you're not an expectancy machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a cold cognitive computation </v>

69
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't act in the world in accordance</v>

70
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.954
<v Speaker 2>with what you expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Act in the world in accordance with </v>

71
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 2>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>

72
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a critical difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you read graze,</v>

73
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neuropsychology of anxiety,</v>

74
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>and you get a sense of the cybernetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>model that's underneath there,</v>

75
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>there's never any real mention of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation per se,</v>

76
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.354
<v Speaker 2>except for emotional motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the approach system and the the </v>

77
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>fear system and the negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

78
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.384
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but motivation as such doesn't seem to </v>

79
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 2>enter into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

80
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:56.254
<v Speaker 2>the fact that entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are hungry and thirsty and </v>

81
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>desirous of sexual contact and playful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those sorts of things.</v>

82
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 2>You can read Jaak Panksepp for better </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of those systems.</v>

83
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 2>But those things have to be brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

84
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And my proposition as soon as you bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them together is you get narrative</v>

85
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:11.944
<v Speaker 2>because you're talking about people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are motivated and want things and then </v>

86
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:16.504
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of the structures that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>use to operate in the world to get the </v>

87
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>things that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a narrative now.</v>

88
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it looks to me.</v>

89
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.703
<v Speaker 2>So here's another set of propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The propositions are this and that is </v>

90
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>that the systems that we use to perceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and categorize,</v>

91
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.871
<v Speaker 2>the world did evolve and they evolved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a manner that's standard with regards to</v>

92
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.174
<v Speaker 2>how things evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that new things are built on </v>

93
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:49.594
<v Speaker 2>old things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't escape from the old </v>

94
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have them.</v>

95
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>They're present in your current model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't get somewhere from nowhere.</v>

96
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you're constrained by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting points.</v>

97
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.424
<v Speaker 2>And so I would like to offer you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition that the basic sub elements </v>

98
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.554
<v Speaker 2>of our conceptual structures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore of our narrative structures </v>

99
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.663
<v Speaker 2>are symbolic representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world as a place to act that are based </v>

100
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 2>in our long prehistory of fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>social existence.</v>

101
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.773
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm just going to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brief introduction into some of those </v>

102
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

103
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that the more probable,</v>

104
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>the more long lasting a phenomena is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it's probable that a biological</v>

105
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:39.521
<v Speaker 2>entity in contact with that phenomena is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have adapted to it perceptually</v>

106
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:40.574
<v Speaker 2>behaviorally and conceptually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things we might think </v>

107
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:48.491
<v Speaker 2>about is given your nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that you're an evolved organism,</v>

108
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>what have been the most permanent </v>
<v Speaker 2>features of your evolutionary history to</v>

109
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:54.554
<v Speaker 2>which you've adapted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to talk about some that </v>

110
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.184
<v Speaker 2>are more complex than the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground beneath your feet is generally </v>

111
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 2>from we obviously we've adapted to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.073
<v Speaker 2>and we've adapted to the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>light and we've adapted to the presence </v>

113
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 2>of an atmosphere and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all very constant phenomena.</v>

114
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>But then there are constants of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that are virtually as old.</v>

115
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And we've talked about that a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

116
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 2>One of them I posited was the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

117
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I gave you some evidence that that's at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least 400 million years old.</v>

118
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also the fact of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation.</v>

119
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the fundamental facts of human </v>

120
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:32.024
<v Speaker 2>being and human social being is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are roughly speaking two genders </v>

121
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.153
<v Speaker 2>and that that's permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a masculine element of the social </v>

122
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.054
<v Speaker 2>world and a feminine element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social world are constants just as the </v>

123
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 2>social world is a constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say mothers and fathers</v>

124
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 2>are very constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is constant as mammals are,</v>

125
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.993
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because we've had mothers and </v>

126
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:54.524
<v Speaker 2>fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking since we became </v>

127
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.564
<v Speaker 2>mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are some reptiles that are </v>

128
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 2>actually manifest some pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 2>parental behavior and it occurs in birds</v>

129
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:03.074
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

130
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>and even in fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

131
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.504
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say the figure of the </v>

132
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:09.284
<v Speaker 2>child is constant and to figure of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>old man and the old woman are constants </v>

133
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.473
<v Speaker 2>and there's some more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>constants that are necessary to </v>

134
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.204
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>

135
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.163
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one constant is that you have a </v>

136
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:20.054
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other constant is that there's </v>

137
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:23.084
<v Speaker 2>something outside that territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another constant constant is that you </v>

138
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 2>can be a pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be prayed for a predator.</v>

139
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:30.973
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another constant is there are </v>

140
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 2>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.434
<v Speaker 2>So your conceptual systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that you utilize today are </v>

142
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.644
<v Speaker 2>going to be grounded in representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied representations and conceptual </v>

143
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:52.601
<v Speaker 2>representations that have already </v>
<v Speaker 2>structured themselves in accordance with</v>

144
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:53.714
<v Speaker 2>the existence of those constants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're drawing on them as part of </v>

145
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 2>the representational system that orients</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in the world.</v>

146
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually works,</v>

147
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 2>which is very peculiar thing as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell.</v>

148
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.504
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's struck me as</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense in comprehensible is that </v>

149
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the use of these fundamental cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories too,</v>

150
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.813
<v Speaker 2>when you apply them to a world that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense isn't objectively configured </v>

151
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>in accordance with those conceptions.</v>

152
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 2>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it functions if you,</v>

153
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:27.324
<v Speaker 2>if it actually applies so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>live using those categories and you're </v>

154
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

155
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

156
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>so as we move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because so I said,</v>

157
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 2>well you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a frame of reference in</v>

158
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:40.584
<v Speaker 2>the frame of reference is cybernetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's an analogy between the </v>

159
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic structure and an at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative structure.</v>

160
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very tight analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's likely an identity.</v>

161
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

162
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.873
<v Speaker 2>that's a set of premises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next premise is that within those </v>

163
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:58.581
<v Speaker 2>narratives there are constants of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation and action and that those</v>

164
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:04.671
<v Speaker 2>are human procedural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>

165
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>So things that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are,</v>

166
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:13.131
<v Speaker 2>there are human conceptual universals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those conceptual universals,</v>

167
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.743
<v Speaker 2>the grounding of those conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>universals is in ancient biological </v>

168
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:25.581
<v Speaker 2>systems that had to conceptualize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that failed if they didn't conceptualize</v>

169
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 2>a certain realm of constance in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

170
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And I laid out the constance masculinity</v>
<v Speaker 2>femininity,</v>

171
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old age.</v>

172
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory,</v>

174
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 2>prey and Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

175
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that's all of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it is all of them,</v>

176
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 2>but we can get an awful long way with </v>
<v Speaker 2>just those.</v>

177
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Now if you read terror management </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorists,</v>

178
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.603
<v Speaker 2>the terror management theorists will </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you something like your belief </v>

179
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.284
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of conceptualized as a </v>

180
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:08.031
<v Speaker 2>system of interrelated abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevents you from terror of death.</v>

181
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's Ernest Becker.</v>

182
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 2>That's her inspectors theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good theory.</v>

183
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:15.804
<v Speaker 2>It was grounded on Friday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and he developed that </v>

184
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.880
<v Speaker 2>theory in a book called the denial of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

185
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.953
<v Speaker 2>which is also a pretty good book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem with the basic theory </v>

186
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

187
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:28.764
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad theory and at certain </v>

188
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 2>levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty good theory,</v>

189
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has serious flaws.</v>

190
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>The first flaw is your belief system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not merely conceptual.</v>

191
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 2>You act it out and that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and so,</v>

192
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't also not the belief system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that protects you.</v>

193
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.153
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that other people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized a society around you </v>

194
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:53.454
<v Speaker 2>predicated on that belief system and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>society works like it's not a </v>

195
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>psychological society isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological phenomena.</v>

196
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.063
<v Speaker 2>You have a representation of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation in part as a </v>

197
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:03.604
<v Speaker 2>psychological phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you can sit here in </v>

198
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 2>relative peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harmony,</v>

199
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warmth,</v>

200
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and light is not a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>

201
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.683
<v Speaker 2>It's embedded in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of what protects you from </v>

202
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.494
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety isn't a psychological structure </v>

203
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.704
<v Speaker 2>that stops you from being afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an actual structure that stops you </v>

204
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 2>from dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so both are right,</v>

205
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but you can't forget about the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental one,</v>

206
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:30.934
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most fundamental one is the most </v>

207
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 2>fundamental one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

208
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 2>if an event's so occur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even social conflict,</v>

209
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:37.924
<v Speaker 2>and I perceived that the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that social conflict is not only a </v>

210
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:42.394
<v Speaker 2>direct disruption of what I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also a disruption of the society </v>

211
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:46.444
<v Speaker 2>that that protects and shelters me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then of course I'm going to respond </v>

212
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:51.214
<v Speaker 2>negatively to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not for only for merely </v>

213
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:54.454
<v Speaker 2>conceptual reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because if the substructure of the </v>

214
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 2>is actually destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to freeze to death in the dark</v>

215
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't want to oversight the law.</v>

216
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.890
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to make things more </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological than they actually are.</v>

217
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.290
<v Speaker 2>And we have to remember that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>

218
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.243
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy is represented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also exists out there in the </v>

219
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:17.880
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real thing.</v>

220
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're going to progress through some</v>

221
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 2>models of emotional processing and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>some neuropsychological models,</v>

222
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic domain.</v>

223
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.440
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to happen now.</v>

224
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.303
<v Speaker 2>So you're going from point a to point B </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're looking at the world through </v>

225
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:37.074
<v Speaker 2>that framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that framework also configures your </v>

226
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.170
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and it also configures your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional responses.</v>

227
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>And so it's variable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within the variability,</v>

228
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.310
<v Speaker 2>there are constants and the constants </v>
<v Speaker 2>are you're going somewhere,</v>

229
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you come from somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you go from one to the other,</v>

230
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.960
<v Speaker 2>there's only three things that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

231
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.453
<v Speaker 2>something you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing that gets you to </v>

232
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:04.281
<v Speaker 2>where you're going and it validates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical integrity of your perceptual</v>

233
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:06.870
<v Speaker 2>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an important thing,</v>

234
00:14:06.871 --> 00:14:07.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

235
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:08.064
<v Speaker 2>it does two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to where you're going and it </v>

236
00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:13.350
<v Speaker 2>provides evidence that your current </v>
<v Speaker 2>model is actually function.</v>

237
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.770
<v Speaker 2>So if you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those things go into question.</v>

238
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.780
<v Speaker 2>One is you're not getting where you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>

239
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:20.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the worst one is,</v>

240
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.713
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole system that you're using to </v>

241
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:25.770
<v Speaker 2>try to get to where you go also might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you don't know where.</v>

242
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's</v>

243
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 2>things that happen the way you want them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

244
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.003
<v Speaker 2>That gets you to where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>validates your model that produces </v>

245
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:37.024
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way it produces positive emotion is </v>

246
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 2>by activating the dopaminergic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dopaminergic system is embedded,</v>

247
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.153
<v Speaker 2>it has its roots in the hypothalamus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus is roughly split into </v>

248
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.204
<v Speaker 2>two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One part pops up sub personalities that </v>

249
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 2>are charged with dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental biological necessities.</v>

250
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 2>So aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger,</v>

251
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.070
<v Speaker 2>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual activity,</v>

252
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:01.904
<v Speaker 2>temperature regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the real basic animal like </v>

253
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 2>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

254
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 2>that have to be gratified in order for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to survive.</v>

255
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Half the hypothalamus deals with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

256
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 2>And then the other half deals with </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>

257
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 2>And so that's pretty cool because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it implies is that the urge to explore,</v>

258
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.733
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

259
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 2>and the capability of responding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that serve as markers on your way</v>

260
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.570
<v Speaker 2>to a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That system is about as old from a file,</v>

261
00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:36.000
<v Speaker 2>a genetic perspective as the systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that regulate such things as hunger is a</v>

262
00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.200
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fundamental,</v>

263
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamental and deeply rooted </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

264
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.313
<v Speaker 2>And so we're not talking about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's peripheral or that's only </v>

265
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 2>cognitive or it's only a manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a few thousand years of culture.</v>

266
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 2>It's deep and it's so deep that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even fight with it.</v>

267
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:57.950
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that you can tolerate</v>

268
00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:58.784
<v Speaker 2>being alive is because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressing towards goals that you </v>

269
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 2>regard as valid and when you're making </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>

270
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 2>the dopaminergic system kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an approach system.</v>

271
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 2>It kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel good.</v>

272
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 2>So there's a positive emotional element </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>

273
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like it's okay to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with the world.</v>

274
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.823
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of the message of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also facilitates certain kinds of </v>

275
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 2>learning because it basically says since</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing right now is working,</v>

276
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if you learn how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

277
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 2>So it reinforces it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

278
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reinforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

279
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 2>And then it also suppresses anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

280
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

281
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 2>but cocaine is a pretty good analgesic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you mix cocaine with opiates,</v>

282
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.333
<v Speaker 2>which is something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever dying of intractable cancer </v>

283
00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:46.364
<v Speaker 2>and you're in terrible pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you Mitch mixed stimulants with </v>

284
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:49.214
<v Speaker 2>opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a better pain medication than </v>

285
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 2>either one of them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus you stay alert,</v>

286
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 2>which is also a useful thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ritalin and opiates works as well.</v>

287
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.253
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

288
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

289
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It's important to know that if you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>know someone who's in severe,</v>

290
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 2>intractable and final pain cause it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be managed,</v>

291
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 2>although doctors are loath to fix those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

292
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 2>So when does the dopaminergic system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that manifest itself?</v>

294
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:16.634
<v Speaker 2>Well under two conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is when you're moving towards a </v>

295
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:20.804
<v Speaker 2>valued goal and the signs are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually succeeding in your </v>

296
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:24.434
<v Speaker 2>movement towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is because the </v>

297
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.104
<v Speaker 2>dopaminergic system responds to cues of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatory reward and Consumer Tory </v>

298
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>reward is any reward that brings the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual system,</v>

299
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it the sub personality to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>halt.</v>

300
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hungry,</v>

301
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.613
<v Speaker 2>then as long as you're hungry and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that frame of mind than anything </v>

302
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:46.214
<v Speaker 2>associated with food is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing in a dopaminergic Lee </v>

303
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 2>mediated way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically that's incentive reward.</v>

304
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.603
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as you eat well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that frame of reference is no </v>

305
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 2>longer relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it disappears,</v>

306
00:17:58.261 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and then food isn't reinforcing.</v>

307
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

308
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.093
<v Speaker 2>because you might think that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that you could stop eating when </v>

309
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you'd had enough is that food would stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasting,</v>

310
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

311
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The food still tastes the same,</v>

312
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's no longer enjoyable.</v>

313
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:16.670
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that actually is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

314
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>the taste system has two elements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are separated physiologically.</v>

315
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:21.534
<v Speaker 2>One of them is responsible for taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also responsible for sort of </v>

316
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to crave different foods during</v>

317
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:29.754
<v Speaker 2>an eating episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's actually a separate one for </v>

318
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>sweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

319
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.210
<v Speaker 2>And so you can satiate the others and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not satiate the sweet receptors.</v>

320
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 2>And then you want some dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So any,</v>

321
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>and if you keep rewarding that system </v>
<v Speaker 2>with dessert,</v>

322
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>then it's going to get more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

323
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.750
<v Speaker 2>But there's another system that sits on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that that acts independently.</v>

324
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's job is to say how good each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those tastes now are.</v>

325
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.413
<v Speaker 2>And so as you get satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that system just shuts </v>

326
00:18:58.051 --> 00:18:58.884
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stops associating the tastes with </v>

327
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

328
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.630
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a cool way of setting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

329
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:04.464
<v Speaker 2>I think you can still taste things which</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to do because you're an </v>

330
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.374
<v Speaker 2>omnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you couldn't taste things well </v>

331
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:09.114
<v Speaker 2>then you die because you put something </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid in your mouth and that'd be the </v>

332
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 2>end of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can maintain the taste.</v>

333
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.884
<v Speaker 2>But the reward varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dopaminergic system responds to </v>

334
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:18.804
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is accused that a consumer reward </v>

335
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:21.984
<v Speaker 2>our forthcoming from a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and the Conservatory reward </v>

336
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.363
<v Speaker 2>stops the action of the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another system that needs a </v>

337
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:29.694
<v Speaker 2>conservatory reward pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense what's happening is </v>

338
00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:32.724
<v Speaker 2>that you're continually subject to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of new motivated </v>

339
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.403
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities or frames of reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just cycling through those </v>

340
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:43.524
<v Speaker 2>things all the time.</v>

341
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

342
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:50.110
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you are in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorable state and you've just satiated</v>

343
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:50.963
<v Speaker 2>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that is you'll find the </v>

344
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 2>environment itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mildly curiosity,</v>

345
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.404
<v Speaker 2>inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dopaminergic system will make </v>

346
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:02.304
<v Speaker 2>exploring novelty rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you'll go out and you'll do some </v>

347
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>random exploration because what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>

348
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 2>you might as well do something while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're awake and that will increase your</v>

349
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.490
<v Speaker 2>realm of competence and the the the size</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your explored territory.</v>

350
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's a fundament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very fundamental,</v>

351
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not a drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very fundamental subpersonality.</v>

352
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm telling you that it's</v>

353
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.713
<v Speaker 2>nested in the hypothalamus is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want you to be thinking that this </v>

354
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>is some new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

355
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 2>really old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

356
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.473
<v Speaker 2>it's probably about as old as pain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>its older I think than anxiety because </v>

357
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:40.734
<v Speaker 2>anxiety seems to be manifested mostly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of higher order cognitive </v>

358
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 2>and emotional systems that evolved after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus evolved,</v>

359
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.023
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

360
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.313
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

361
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 2>so when you're on your way somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things or bad things can happen.</v>

362
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:54.874
<v Speaker 2>If good things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a dopamine kick and that keeps </v>

363
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:57.424
<v Speaker 2>you focused on your goal and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>validates your theory and you get to </v>

364
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>move to where you're going and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer Tory reward and good for you.</v>

365
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:03.754
<v Speaker 2>That's success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except that a new frame of reference </v>

366
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>pops up and you have the same problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sizzle,</v>

367
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.613
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always pushing the damn rock up </v>

368
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 2>the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always rolling back down.</v>

369
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.023
<v Speaker 2>Question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you find any delight and pushing the </v>

370
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:15.304
<v Speaker 2>rock up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing that can happen is </v>

371
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 2>something you don't want to have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that thing indicates that you're not</v>

372
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 2>getting to where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is,</v>

373
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.823
<v Speaker 2>what should you do when you find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not getting where you want </v>

374
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 2>to go?</v>

375
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually know.</v>

376
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 2>You actually don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is where things get complicated</v>

377
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 2>because on the one hand you could say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could run into a known obstacle.</v>

378
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:40.534
<v Speaker 2>You remember Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are known unknowns and unknown </v>

379
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:45.420
<v Speaker 2>unknowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

380
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 2>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably too young for that.</v>

381
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:47.974
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm walking towards the door and I </v>

382
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 2>encounter this table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's going to frustrate and annoy</v>

383
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:56.074
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's only going to do it to a </v>

384
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:58.474
<v Speaker 2>limited degree because I can make a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial correction in trajectory and I </v>

385
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 2>can get to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say,</v>

386
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>well that's just an obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

387
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>it's an obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know its features.</v>

388
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:08.704
<v Speaker 2>I have a prearranged Schema of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception and action so that I can </v>

389
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 2>render it irrelevant with very little </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

390
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a known obstacle,</v>

391
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 2>but then that's fine.</v>

392
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.580
<v Speaker 2>So those are just negative things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to get them out of your way.</v>

393
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:22.414
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's partly why you clean up your </v>

394
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

395
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:25.804
<v Speaker 2>Because you want your house to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order so that if you're doing things in </v>

396
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:29.464
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things don't get in your way and annoy </v>

397
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes it more efficient.</v>

398
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.963
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you're doing doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to ensure that the paths you </v>

399
00:22:38.261 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two desired ends are clear.</v>

400
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means to have a place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

401
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.950
<v Speaker 2>So it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

402
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 2>it means also the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even more important,</v>

403
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you're walking from point a to</v>

404
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:53.344
<v Speaker 2>point B and a table gets in the way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're a little annoyed that </v>

405
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 2>you go around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a problem.</v>

406
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:02.551
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes something else happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my old supervisor had this dog and he</v>

407
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>used to take it for a walk.</v>

408
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take your dog for a walk.</v>

409
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one day he was walking along the curb</v>

410
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>and his dog pulled him a little bit into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street and he fell.</v>

411
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>And he shattered his leg like in seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and it was just,</v>

412
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing wrong with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>

413
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just that he fell wrong and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>

414
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:24.550
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had to put a bunch of plates in</v>

415
00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:25.384
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

416
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.313
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different category of </v>

417
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.670
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

418
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.533
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the magnitude of that negative </v>

419
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:35.530
<v Speaker 2>thing is very large compared to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>running into a table.</v>

420
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay fine,</v>

421
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>there's hospitals and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he got dealt with and he was put back</v>

422
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:40.984
<v Speaker 2>together and even his fear of the event </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be bounded by his knowledge that </v>

423
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 2>there is a hypothetical means of dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the unexpected occurrence.</v>

424
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as nasty as things that you</v>

425
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:52.844
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to do with that all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are things you encounter in </v>

426
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.104
<v Speaker 2>life too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've given you some examples of </v>

427
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 2>those before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A betrayal's a big one.</v>

428
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason betrayal is such </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big one is because first,</v>

429
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to form a partnership or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friendship with someone,</v>

430
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you're staking a lot of your life on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

431
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.883
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're staking your future on </v>

432
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're staking your present on it.</v>

433
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.863
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an important presumption of the </v>

434
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:24.290
<v Speaker 2>nature of your reality moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next thing is,</v>

435
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:29.291
<v Speaker 2>is that when someone betrays you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they violate your model of what it means</v>

436
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:30.164
<v Speaker 2>to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem because you're </v>

437
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>dealing with humans all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're also a human.</v>

438
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're betrayed,</v>

439
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.713
<v Speaker 2>that casts the validity of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure you use to orient yourself </v>

440
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:46.340
<v Speaker 2>with regards to yourself and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social world into disarray.</v>

441
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very big explosion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>

442
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

443
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:52.724
<v Speaker 2>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well people are full of snakes and you </v>

444
00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:55.230
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what does that mean?</v>

445
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 2>It means that something like during our </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history,</v>

446
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 2>predatory reptiles were a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

447
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:03.854
<v Speaker 2>when we used to live in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then tree dwelling snakes would eat us </v>

448
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>and our offspring more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that would be easier.</v>

449
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.313
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lasted some tens of millions of </v>

450
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a trivial amount of time.</v>

451
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.443
<v Speaker 2>And then there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're on the belt and we're going </v>

452
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 2>down to get a nice drink of water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a Nile crocodile down there</v>

453
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 2>and he's comes up and snaps you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls you in.</v>

454
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:29.411
<v Speaker 2>So that subterranean predatory reptiles </v>
<v Speaker 2>really sort of make us nervous.</v>

455
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:30.644
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps that's why people think snakes </v>

456
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 2>are slimy and they're not.</v>

457
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>But if you talk to someone who's afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a snake,</v>

458
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.521
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

459
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 2>it's slimy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

460
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:43.220
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an underwater reptile might be slimy and</v>

461
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.380
<v Speaker 2>a snake is quite a lot like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater reptile.</v>

462
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 2>And who cares how they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

463
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>the relevant issue is how they're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

464
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is one of the categories.</v>

465
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible Predator that lurks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a category.</v>

466
00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Now I think that what happens when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>run into something that's radically </v>

467
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:08.471
<v Speaker 2>unexpected is that we use are horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator category to get ready for it.</v>

468
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.203
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also why the terror management </v>

469
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:14.054
<v Speaker 2>theories aren't exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have some evidence from our lab </v>

470
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.504
<v Speaker 2>that I've really been wrestling with </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last few years because one of </v>

471
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:20.384
<v Speaker 2>the things we found is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people are more </v>

472
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:24.134
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they tend more towards right wing </v>

473
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian viewpoints.</v>

474
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And you can parse conscientiousness up </v>
<v Speaker 2>into two elements,</v>

475
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:31.783
<v Speaker 2>industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of predicts academic </v>

476
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 2>performance and success in life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>

477
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Orderliness predicts right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism,</v>

478
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.121
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

479
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>that's no surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like authoritarians orderly,</v>

480
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:44.574
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bloody big surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that because we've been </v>

481
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.024
<v Speaker 2>trying to localize the position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism in the personality </v>

482
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy for 50 years and for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longest period of time,</v>

483
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:55.884
<v Speaker 2>people thought that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were conservative and right wing </v>

484
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 2>is because they were afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that's not true.</v>

485
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 2>They're lower in neuroticism than </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals.</v>

486
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.521
<v Speaker 2>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

487
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:06.354
<v Speaker 2>that's because they're so well protected</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the rigid theories that they'd never </v>

488
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 2>have to expose themselves to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's frightening.</v>

489
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.874
<v Speaker 2>But if you could use your damn theory to</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict results that are opposite to </v>

490
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 2>what you predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

491
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:16.494
<v Speaker 2>it's really not much of a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's better just to take the </v>

492
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:20.094
<v Speaker 2>data on the face of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are higher and wellbeing </v>

493
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 2>and their lower in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not a huge difference,</v>

494
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different enough.</v>

495
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orderly people are high in disgust,</v>

496
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:31.764
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole new realm of horrors </v>

497
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 2>because disgust sensitivity is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>action of an intrinsic biological system</v>

498
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:41.244
<v Speaker 2>that stops you from being contaminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and contamination kills you if it's </v>

499
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 2>contaminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're contaminated enough.</v>

500
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
<v Speaker 2>So here's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to the native Americans</v>

501
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 2>when the Europeans showed up?</v>

502
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.110
<v Speaker 2>95% of them died,</v>

503
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Measles,</v>

504
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.790
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Measles wasn't good.</v>

505
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Moms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smallpox,</v>

506
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.160
<v Speaker 2>fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

507
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.610
<v Speaker 2>you shake hands with someone from Spain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Poof,</v>

508
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.420
<v Speaker 2>250 million people are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

509
00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:19.090
<v Speaker 2>so you think about that over the course </v>
<v Speaker 2>of evolutionary history,</v>

510
00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:20.980
<v Speaker 2>like this is still happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

511
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.143
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still isolated tribes in the </v>

512
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when the miners or the oil,</v>

513
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.483
<v Speaker 2>you know the oil explorers or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the jungle and they find a new </v>

514
00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:32.200
<v Speaker 2>tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they interacted,</v>

515
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.670
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the whole tribe's dead.</v>

516
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.463
<v Speaker 2>And so you think how often in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history has it been the </v>

517
00:28:38.441 --> 00:28:42.310
<v Speaker 2>case that when we encountered a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been separated us from,</v>

518
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.173
<v Speaker 2>from us historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one or the other of the group just </v>

519
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:48.640
<v Speaker 2>basically all died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows and we are.</v>

520
00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:49.474
<v Speaker 2>So that's something to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what's one of the things that </v>

521
00:28:51.731 --> 00:28:56.731
<v Speaker 2>seems to happen is that we associate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange and unknown and foreign with the</v>

522
00:28:57.611 --> 00:29:02.140
<v Speaker 2>disgusting and contaminating as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the frightening and uncontrollable.</v>

523
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.303
<v Speaker 2>And I think the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize that is as a global pred </v>

524
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:06.723
<v Speaker 2>prey Predator response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're responding using the biological </v>

525
00:29:09.221 --> 00:29:10.054
<v Speaker 2>systems that we originally used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect us from predators that were </v>

526
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 2>lurking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if you've ever might,</v>

527
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.313
<v Speaker 2>my daughter picked up a garter snake at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point and the males exude this sort </v>

528
00:29:20.501 --> 00:29:23.260
<v Speaker 2>of sticky substance that's protective </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I tell you,</v>

529
00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.094
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing in the world that </v>

530
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 2>smells worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just indescribably horrible.</v>

531
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And she used to keep snakes in her room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

532
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.660
<v Speaker 2>she'd have nightmares about snakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly often,</v>

533
00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:35.494
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was quite interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it was probably an old </v>

534
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:39.610
<v Speaker 2>factory issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

535
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.444
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

536
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>their biological byproducts shall we </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

537
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.640
<v Speaker 2>are unbearably disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so well,</v>

538
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 2>what should be the response to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predator?</v>

539
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but discussed is pretty good to go along</v>

540
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 2>with fear and apprehension and </v>
<v Speaker 2>readiness.</v>

541
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

542
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

543
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.033
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how is that associated with the </v>

544
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:11.140
<v Speaker 2>fact of the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because I was talking about betrayal,</v>

545
00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.253
<v Speaker 2>said if you'd be traced someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what happens basically is that you </v>

546
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 2>manifest yourself as a set of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

547
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:20.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

548
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:21.710
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

549
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 2>How can I justify a statement like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

550
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.793
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking that we've never been </v>

551
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>preyed upon by each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's definitely wrong.</v>

552
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.053
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are a very murderous lock and </v>

553
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>we'd been running back and forth across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface of the earth,</v>

554
00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 2>wiping each other out for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

555
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.913
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you're full of snakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a perfectly adequate idea except </v>

556
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

557
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:47.494
<v Speaker 2>you're full of Nile crocodiles except </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're even worse cause you have a huge </v>

558
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>brain in weapons.</v>

559
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 2>You're one nasty thing and so to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to respond to you,</v>

560
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.374
<v Speaker 2>revealing yourself as something other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than what I expected as if you were a </v>

561
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Predator is a perfectly reasonable thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

562
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd be traced someone,</v>

563
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it fundamentally is the case that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a Predator in relationship to them.</v>

564
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more of an abstract Predator in </v>

565
00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 2>that you've been taking advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

566
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.850
<v Speaker 2>But who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's close enough so that it'll work.</v>

567
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>So if you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you understand,</v>

568
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:23.074
<v Speaker 2>if you're willing to accept the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use the same systems to deal </v>

569
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:31.600
<v Speaker 2>with profound anomalies that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors used to deal with predators,</v>

570
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.330
<v Speaker 2>then there's a whole bunch of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that start to become clear.</v>

571
00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 2>One of them is the symbolism that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the unknown,</v>

572
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.040
<v Speaker 2>but the other is the pronounced human </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendency to demonize the foreigner.</v>

573
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 2>So we don't demonize the foreigner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We demonize them.</v>

574
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Once we get to know them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start out demonic,</v>

575
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.283
<v Speaker 2>they start out as prey predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very difficult for us to pull </v>

576
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:54.851
<v Speaker 2>back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

577
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that's the only way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to people who are different than</v>

578
00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:58.924
<v Speaker 2>us because you know there are unknown </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the unknown is complex and there's </v>

579
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 2>promising that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that for human beings,</v>

580
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions are far more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pound for pound,</v>

581
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:11.824
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then positive emotions and the </v>

582
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 2>appropriate way for me to respond to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know you is to start out with</v>

583
00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 2>the presupposition that maybe you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill me.</v>

584
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.253
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know how isolated </v>

585
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 2>tribes start to trade with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting.</v>

586
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So maybe they'll get some idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another tribe around and so,</v>

587
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.873
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they'll observe that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe is doing something or rather that </v>

588
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 2>might be interesting.</v>

589
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:34.683
<v Speaker 2>And so what they'll do is they'll find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>border between the two territories and </v>

590
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.284
<v Speaker 2>they'll leave things that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable there and then they'll run the </v>

591
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:40.874
<v Speaker 2>hell away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe what will happen is the </v>

592
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>other tribal come along and if they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>

593
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:48.140
<v Speaker 2>they'll pick them up and they'll leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other things that are valuable that</v>

594
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:50.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe they make behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

595
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beginning of,</v>

596
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the beginning of trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly not,</v>

597
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we run up to each other and see what the</v>

598
00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:58.064
<v Speaker 2>hell is going to go on right off the bat</v>
<v Speaker 2>because God only knows what's going to </v>

599
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 2>happen if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>

600
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.540
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable for us to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreign other as a predatory entity,</v>

601
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 2>even though obviously that has all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of catastrophic consequences,</v>

602
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to fix that,</v>

603
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:18.020
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand why it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

604
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.093
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't that we attribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange person and the strange idea or </v>

605
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:27.881
<v Speaker 2>the foreigner what's negative fro from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious cognitive perspective.</v>

606
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Although we might also do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

607
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.343
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way we are with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to things that we cannot conceptualize </v>

608
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 2>or frame in question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

609
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.943
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

610
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.360
<v Speaker 2>So you'll have to make that a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more specific.</v>

611
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.723
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

612
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.823
<v Speaker 2>Well I would say the reason that Ebay </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked is because all it was all the </v>

613
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.570
<v Speaker 2>members of the same tribe that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

614
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.093
<v Speaker 2>We'd already laid down rules for trading</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone really understands and we </v>

615
00:34:08.311 --> 00:34:09.144
<v Speaker 2>automatically engage in so we could just</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer what we already knew about </v>

616
00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:13.860
<v Speaker 2>trading to the new domain.</v>

617
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.343
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

618
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>well I think it's the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocity.</v>

619
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 2>It's basically sharing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 2>in human beings are deeply sharing </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>

621
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:41.024
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things to think about </v>

622
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about us wandering </v>
<v Speaker 2>around desecrating the planet.</v>

623
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 2>We're really good at sharing and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals aren't good at that at all.</v>

624
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so sharing and trading.</v>

625
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

626
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Trading is sharing over long</v>

627
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.220
<v Speaker 3>run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

628
00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.003
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

629
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.400
<v Speaker 2>if I'm only sharing with you that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not sharing with me,</v>

630
00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:04.620
<v Speaker 2>that's going to get pretty damn boring </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty quick.</v>

631
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.753
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to be very careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about reciprocity arrangements and so </v>

632
00:35:08.521 --> 00:35:11.670
<v Speaker 2>that can keep the sharing going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what trade is.</v>

633
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're going along and</v>

634
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 2>you can encounter positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can encounter negative things,</v>

635
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 2>and then you can encounter the category </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that you don't understand.</v>

636
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.033
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental question is what should </v>

637
00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:31.880
<v Speaker 2>you be doing about the category of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you don't understand?</v>

638
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to go back to</v>

639
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 3>this finger.</v>

640
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I hope this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

641
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.200
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to try to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

642
00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.220
<v Speaker 2>You're betrayed by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

643
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.050
<v Speaker 2>You had them in the good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

644
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.343
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're not in the good person </v>

645
00:36:17.331 --> 00:36:18.710
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

646
00:36:18.711 --> 00:36:22.280
<v Speaker 2>So exactly what are they like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

647
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>while all these sub routines are up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabs,</v>

648
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what any of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of anymore.</v>

649
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.020
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person has betrayed you,</v>

650
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.170
<v Speaker 2>reveals to you their potential inner </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity,</v>

651
00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:34.004
<v Speaker 2>and it also reveals to you the potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential potential inner complexity of </v>

652
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.600
<v Speaker 2>beings in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

653
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Now you might want to say if something </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected happens,</v>

654
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.340
<v Speaker 2>how should you calibrate your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>responses?</v>

655
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.773
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the problem is here is that </v>

656
00:36:52.461 --> 00:36:55.580
<v Speaker 2>responding to novelty turns out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated phenomena.</v>

657
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.683
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that novelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a normally is a very complicated </v>

658
00:36:59.631 --> 00:37:00.464
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

659
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.333
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when unexpected things happen </v>

660
00:37:03.591 --> 00:37:05.030
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good.</v>

661
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.580
<v Speaker 2>And other times when unexpected things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you,</v>

662
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:08.623
<v Speaker 2>they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means that they're a </v>

663
00:37:10.251 --> 00:37:12.920
<v Speaker 2>paradoxical category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are category two,</v>

664
00:37:12.921 --> 00:37:13.754
<v Speaker 2>which the rules of logic do not apply </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can be be a not be your Aa </v>

665
00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and na Aa at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

666
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.413
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something unexpected happens to </v>

667
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:25.394
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the appropriate way to respond </v>

668
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.200
<v Speaker 2>and answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

669
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.513
<v Speaker 2>you do a firsthand approximation when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unexpected thing first reveals </v>

670
00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:36.644
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then basically you adopt the stance of </v>

671
00:37:39.201 --> 00:37:44.201
<v Speaker 2>this might be a fatal predatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation and then pretty rapidly if</v>

672
00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:45.974
<v Speaker 2>nothing else happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to loosen up and start to </v>

673
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:54.410
<v Speaker 2>infer that the unexpected thing isn't as</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic as you thought it would be.</v>

674
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.693
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you determine the difference </v>

675
00:37:57.651 --> 00:38:02.600
<v Speaker 2>between levels of catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected events and answer to me seems</v>

676
00:38:02.601 --> 00:38:06.470
<v Speaker 2>to be found in this idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical structure.</v>

677
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that all right person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Tracy?</v>

678
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.250
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there are a good person no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer holds,</v>

679
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that's very upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it upsetting?</v>

680
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the answer.</v>

681
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.633
<v Speaker 2>If a person is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they behave in every situation </v>

682
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.090
<v Speaker 2>like a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're not good,</v>

683
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v Speaker 2>how do they behave in every situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now answer to that is you don't have a </v>

684
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 2>clue how they're going to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>

685
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.574
<v Speaker 2>they're all of a sudden extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated and so we could go through </v>

686
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:46.984
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

687
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

688
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.050
<v Speaker 2>If you do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you play with the baby and you</v>

689
00:38:54.051 --> 00:38:56.420
<v Speaker 2>make it cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

690
00:38:56.421 --> 00:38:59.900
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's unexpected.</v>

691
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.370
<v Speaker 2>You're playing with baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>

692
00:39:01.371 --> 00:39:02.840
<v Speaker 2>it cries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all upset about it.</v>

693
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.360
<v Speaker 2>So then what do you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

694
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.093
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good person because I make </v>

695
00:39:08.511 --> 00:39:09.950
<v Speaker 2>babies cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

696
00:39:09.951 --> 00:39:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a reasonable inference,</v>

697
00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:12.074
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you probably don't want to </v>

698
00:39:12.921 --> 00:39:16.760
<v Speaker 2>immediately leap to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an anomaly.</v>

699
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.740
<v Speaker 2>The baby cried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't what you wanted.</v>

700
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.720
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to frame that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And normally in,</v>

701
00:39:20.721 --> 00:39:21.800
<v Speaker 2>because it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:23.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe the mother comes running in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

703
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a story about this.</v>

704
00:39:29.211 --> 00:39:30.044
<v Speaker 2>So one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a wild guy and he was </v>

705
00:39:33.891 --> 00:39:36.260
<v Speaker 2>babysitting his daughter at another</v>

706
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.920
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman started from down the street.</v>

707
00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:40.754
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he plays with them and he plays </v>

708
00:39:41.761 --> 00:39:42.594
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:43.943
<v Speaker 2>pretty intensely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the kids love that except when </v>

710
00:39:46.411 --> 00:39:47.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

711
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.013
<v Speaker 2>so what he's doing is he likes to chase </v>
<v Speaker 2>his daughter around with this remote </v>

712
00:39:52.801 --> 00:39:54.720
<v Speaker 2>control car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

713
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.540
<v Speaker 2>so he's chasing his daughter round with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this remote control car.</v>

714
00:39:57.541 --> 00:39:58.374
<v Speaker 2>And she's having a fine time and her </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend is there and she's also running </v>

715
00:40:01.021 --> 00:40:03.420
<v Speaker 2>away from the remote control car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

716
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having fun and then the two </v>

717
00:40:06.181 --> 00:40:10.740
<v Speaker 2>girls run into the closet and hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my friend is like roaring the car</v>

718
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.390
<v Speaker 2>up against the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

719
00:40:12.391 --> 00:40:13.224
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the closet and scratching at </v>

720
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 2>it a little bit then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his daughter says,</v>

721
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.501
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

722
00:40:19.501 --> 00:40:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

723
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.790
<v Speaker 2>my friend is crying and it's for real.</v>

724
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.571
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

725
00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>So he's feeling pretty bad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he takes the little kids out and he's</v>

726
00:40:28.111 --> 00:40:30.030
<v Speaker 2>picking up the daughter and given her a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pat,</v>

727
00:40:30.031 --> 00:40:32.700
<v Speaker 2>and then she's pretty upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's wailing away about this.</v>

728
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.570
<v Speaker 2>And then the doorbell rings and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl's mother.</v>

729
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.520
<v Speaker 2>And then he's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

730
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.383
<v Speaker 2>I just chased this girl into the closet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then made like scratchy monster </v>

731
00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:46.380
<v Speaker 2>noises on outside and now she's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

732
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.993
<v Speaker 2>How exactly am I going to explain this </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that doesn't make me look like </v>

733
00:40:50.821 --> 00:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>a pathological beast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

734
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's kind of a pathological beast.</v>

735
00:40:56.161 --> 00:40:57.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

736
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.390
<v Speaker 2>you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

737
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 2>hopefully you see the point there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

738
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 2>now the question that he posed to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor was,</v>

739
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.583
<v Speaker 2>where in the hierarchy did I go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he was afraid of was that her </v>

740
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:18.714
<v Speaker 2>response would be if you chase my child </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the closet and then made monster </v>

741
00:41:23.221 --> 00:41:26.010
<v Speaker 2>noises and scared her so much that she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this upset,</v>

742
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.320
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play with the baby.</v>

743
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.570
<v Speaker 2>That means that you are not a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

744
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

745
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

746
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 2>so you can see how that inference can </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagate itself up this chain.</v>

747
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

748
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.153
<v Speaker 2>if you make an error like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should make the presupposition that </v>

749
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:46.364
<v Speaker 2>one of your local routines is at fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you should also make that </v>

750
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:49.634
<v Speaker 2>proposition in relationship to whoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be making a mistake like that </v>

751
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:53.894
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should start from the high </v>

752
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 2>resolution level and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

753
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe they are missing a micro skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the low resolution level,</v>

754
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:01.394
<v Speaker 2>which is they're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem with that sometimes is </v>

755
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 2>it the reason that things didn't go well</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them is that they are a bad person.</v>

756
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.844
<v Speaker 2>But probably you should explore that </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility a bit before immediately </v>

757
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:12.974
<v Speaker 2>leaping to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do leap to that </v>

758
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.540
<v Speaker 2>conclusion and you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also a huge problem.</v>

759
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is that when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected occurrence occurs,</v>

760
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:22.814
<v Speaker 2>like in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire framework is up for debate </v>

761
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know how to localize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

762
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the error and you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>localize its magnitude.</v>

763
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.533
<v Speaker 2>And so what your body will do is default</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the worst possible option at least </v>

764
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:37.210
<v Speaker 2>initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

765
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and that makes sense cause that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive reaction,</v>

766
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

767
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.043
<v Speaker 2>and that can really get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it got out of hand with the </v>

768
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:44.654
<v Speaker 2>daycare scandals in the 1980s when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there were daycare centers all </v>

769
00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:49.334
<v Speaker 2>over the United States and Canada where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these horrible stories </v>

770
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.054
<v Speaker 2>emerging of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>titanic ritual abuse in the daycare </v>

771
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 2>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

772
00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.110
<v Speaker 2>well that's pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go up to the top and you say,</v>

773
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are you not a good person,</v>

774
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>you're actually Satan himself or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

775
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:05.200
<v Speaker 2>a pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

776
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 2>pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

777
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

778
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 2>approximation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sufficiently good approximation.</v>

779
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 2>So the title is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is accurate.</v>

780
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.223
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that caused a lot of people a </v>

781
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a perfectly,</v>

782
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 2>it's an a priori,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undifferentiated natural response.</v>

783
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And the category of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

784
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 2>is individual human being has hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>predator.</v>

785
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.173
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfectly reasonable category </v>
<v Speaker 2>because individual human beings are </v>

786
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:34.520
<v Speaker 2>hyper predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So luckily enough,</v>

787
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 2>that's not all we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

788
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.083
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea in some sense is that when </v>

789
00:43:40.311 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you're walking along and something </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected happens to you,</v>

790
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you basically fall into a hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>

791
00:43:46.131 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 2>is the complexity that's underlying your</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>

792
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.803
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next proposition I would </v>

793
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 2>say to a next proposition I would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lay out is that we actually represent</v>

794
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 2>that domain symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we represented first of all,</v>

795
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 2>often as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the,</v>

796
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.353
<v Speaker 2>it's the water you plunge into when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice beneath your feet breaks the thin </v>

797
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:09.320
<v Speaker 2>ice.</v>

798
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.620
<v Speaker 2>You're always skating on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the underworld of the ancients.</v>

799
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.723
<v Speaker 2>It's hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the place you go when you're </v>

800
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:18.960
<v Speaker 2>desperate and anxious and unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

801
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 2>it's the source of all terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

802
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 2>it's also the source of all possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as the unexpected itself,</v>

803
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:27.764
<v Speaker 2>as the anomalous itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not only everything that can </v>

804
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:30.884
<v Speaker 2>terrify and destroy you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also everything new that can </v>

805
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:38.151
<v Speaker 2>emerge as a consequence of old habits </v>
<v Speaker 2>and presuppositions falling apart.</v>

806
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.613
<v Speaker 2>There were erroneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say one level of </v>

807
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:43.614
<v Speaker 2>representation that we use for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain and for the Denisons of that </v>

808
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:51.951
<v Speaker 2>domain is prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's roughly toothy reptile.</v>

809
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And that can be subterranean toothy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reptile,</v>

810
00:44:56.911 --> 00:45:00.260
<v Speaker 2>or it can be under the oceans toothy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reptile and,</v>

811
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 2>and their variants of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they take monstrous form,</v>

812
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a complex of,</v>

813
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>of things that will destroy you in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory manner.</v>

814
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.043
<v Speaker 2>So that's one domain of symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other domain of symbolism is that </v>

815
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:14.064
<v Speaker 2>which I lies outside tribal territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no man's land and no man's land </v>

816
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:19.734
<v Speaker 2>is in a complicated way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you go when you're </v>

817
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:25.800
<v Speaker 2>culturally sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Presuppositions do no longer function.</v>

818
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing because on the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand you could go outside the borders of</v>

819
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 2>your community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 2>as a physical act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

821
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:34.194
<v Speaker 2>you can go outside the metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of your community by acting </v>

822
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 2>out a culturally sanctified role and </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing.</v>

823
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.873
<v Speaker 2>Cause as soon as you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're somewhere that your culture </v>

824
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:46.560
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's for all intents and purposes,</v>

825
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 2>that's unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a metaphor,</v>

826
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:50.034
<v Speaker 2>it's actually the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the idea of territory is much </v>

827
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:53.154
<v Speaker 2>more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other domain that seems to </v>

828
00:45:55.411 --> 00:46:00.411
<v Speaker 2>be consistently used to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown as such is the feminine.</v>

829
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

830
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:04.134
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that females are actually the </v>

831
00:46:06.451 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 2>gatekeepers to propagation among human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

832
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that they should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically represented by the terrible</v>

833
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 2>and re rejecting element of nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonable perspective,</v>

834
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 2>even though it's harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because the unknown is not only</v>

835
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:26.310
<v Speaker 2>the place where terrible things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the place where everything new</v>

836
00:46:26.311 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 2>was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

837
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And the most salient characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminine is that the feminine is the</v>

838
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 2>place where new things are born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had to use some damn category for</v>

839
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

840
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:38.424
<v Speaker 2>and we only had a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories at hand because of our </v>

841
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:41.784
<v Speaker 2>biological evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is you're wandering </v>

842
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 2>around in your life and then you fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a hole.</v>

843
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 2>And the question is how big is the hole?</v>

844
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment you're falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

845
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 2>So I have another story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a friend who was,</v>

846
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:55.883
<v Speaker 2>he used to hang out in the bush and </v>
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia and now and then he </v>

847
00:46:58.561 --> 00:46:59.394
<v Speaker 2>would be tromping around their owed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter and sometimes he'd crossed </v>

848
00:47:01.171 --> 00:47:02.004
<v Speaker 2>rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one time he was crossing a river </v>

849
00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that was covered with snow and he fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the surface.</v>

850
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Now he was very lucky because what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had fallen through was a bubble of ice.</v>

851
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 2>So we sell about four feet and he hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice again.</v>

852
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:14.723
<v Speaker 2>But you can imagine what must have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in his little sphere of the </v>

853
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:18.414
<v Speaker 2>world during the one 10th of a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was falling before he hit the </v>

854
00:47:22.051 --> 00:47:23.700
<v Speaker 2>new ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

855
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a good story to indicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

856
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the similarity between the unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and falling into the underworld.</v>

857
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:31.833
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily useful is that once you </v>

858
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:35.704
<v Speaker 2>guys know that the idea of a journey to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underworld is the same thing as the </v>

859
00:47:41.321 --> 00:47:42.154
<v Speaker 2>idea of the validity of your conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures breaking out from underneath </v>

860
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 2>you and plunging you into the complexity</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterize his life,</v>

861
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 2>then you have one of the keys that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to understand mythology.</v>

862
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big deal because most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our history,</v>

863
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.883
<v Speaker 2>like our cultural history is presented </v>
<v Speaker 2>to us in the form of extraordinarily </v>

864
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 2>ancient stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the categories those stories use are</v>

865
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the categories that I'm outlining to</v>

866
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:11.794
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you know what the categories </v>

867
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:13.834
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can read the stories and they </v>

868
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:15.724
<v Speaker 2>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a mind bogglingly important </v>

869
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 2>thing because some of the stories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be studying,</v>

870
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.720
<v Speaker 2>like people worked on those things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>150,000</v>

871
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:29.600
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:48:29.601 --> 00:48:30.434
<v Speaker 2>and now maybe that's an overstatement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we certainly know that they worked </v>

873
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 2>on them for thousands of years.</v>

874
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.630
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big problem.</v>

875
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:38.464
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before maybe you could just believe </v>

876
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that meant.</v>

877
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:42.683
<v Speaker 2>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people can't do that anymore </v>

878
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:44.974
<v Speaker 2>because partly because I think because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've developed that a new kind of </v>

879
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:52.330
<v Speaker 2>cognitive system that essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to the world as if it's a place</v>

880
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 2>of objective material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

881
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really useful.</v>

882
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly useful.</v>

883
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.173
<v Speaker 2>But then there's this other cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain that we actually have to </v>

884
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:07.920
<v Speaker 2>understand because without it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're bereft of our history and our,</v>

885
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.873
<v Speaker 2>our values are the bedrock values that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we use to orient ourselves in time and </v>

886
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:16.840
<v Speaker 2>space and to protect us from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic release of our emotions.</v>

887
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.330
<v Speaker 2>All of that's invalidated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

888
00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:19.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:21.220
<v Speaker 2>does that really matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

890
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.293
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many of you have gone </v>

891
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 2>through nihilistic periods in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that it's more than one or</v>

892
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:27.604
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

893
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's one danger is that when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

894
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.850
<v Speaker 2>when the validity of your value system </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

895
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.773
<v Speaker 2>is demolished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you end up in a place where </v>

896
00:49:35.771 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 2>everything's so terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming that you cannot survive.</v>

897
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Speaker 2>And one response to that is you become </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic and depressed and anxious,</v>

898
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 2>and that's not merely psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really hard on you.</v>

899
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>It can undermine your entire wheel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

900
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:49.503
<v Speaker 2>can even drive you to suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And other option is you adopt some </v>

901
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:53.194
<v Speaker 2>moronic totalitarian ideology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>purports to explain everything with a </v>

902
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:57.034
<v Speaker 2>few simple axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's each equally catastrophic </v>

903
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:00.484
<v Speaker 2>because that makes you immediately a </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger to anyone who doesn't believe </v>

904
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus you're fragile because you know,</v>

905
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 2>if it's a simplistic but coherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

906
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:11.044
<v Speaker 2>like the idea that all knowledge systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>are motivated only by the pursuit of </v>

907
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like good luck implementing that in</v>

908
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:17.830
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

909
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:18.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find out pretty soon that that </v>

910
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.990
<v Speaker 2>sort of theory is just not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you anywhere at all.</v>

911
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So it makes you brittle and fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

912
00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.493
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to stop and let you ask </v>

913
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:32.654
<v Speaker 2>questions because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I threw a lot of information at you in </v>

914
00:50:35.691 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 2>the last three weeks and what I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do now,</v>

915
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:38.354
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing is I'm going to tell you </v>

916
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 2>a little bit about the brain areas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are associated with the information,</v>

917
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 2>information processing phenomena that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>

918
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 2>So like one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting apart from the fact that the</v>

919
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>exploratory system is grounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypothalamus,</v>

920
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:52.934
<v Speaker 2>which is mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind boggling stock given how the </v>

921
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus operates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that your right hemisphere,</v>

922
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:59.803
<v Speaker 2>if you're lefthanded and relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>lateralized in the approximately </v>

923
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:04.574
<v Speaker 2>normative manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your right hemisphere basically deals </v>

924
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:07.334
<v Speaker 2>with novelty and anomaly and your left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere deals with explored </v>

925
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:10.790
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

926
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is split in a manner.</v>

927
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 2>So that one part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is mostly responsible for negative</v>

928
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:18.854
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the right hemisphere is kind </v>

929
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:21.244
<v Speaker 2>of good at global pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global quick pattern recognition and it </v>

930
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.993
<v Speaker 2>responds to anomaly and novelty with its</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial formulations of what might be </v>

931
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:30.764
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the left hemisphere is </v>

932
00:51:31.731 --> 00:51:34.070
<v Speaker 2>specialized for operation and explored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

933
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:35.263
<v Speaker 2>So the left hemisphere is primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's operating when you're somewhere </v>

934
00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that you understand and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going according to plan.</v>

935
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's pretty damn interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

936
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:44.331
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:51:44.331 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're dubious about the validity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this theory,</v>

938
00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 2>you could look up elk Colon Goldberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

939
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the people who've proposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the novelty,</v>

940
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory explored territory </v>

941
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:01.560
<v Speaker 2>dichotomy with regards to Brayden </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemispheric specialization.</v>

942
00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 2>And Goldberg was a student of Luria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gloria was a student of Pavlov.</v>

943
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.103
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a pretty vicious intellectual </v>

944
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:08.114
<v Speaker 2>history there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not something to be dispensed </v>

945
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:11.010
<v Speaker 2>with lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

946
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 2>he thinks the reason that the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere is linguistic,</v>

947
00:52:13.941 --> 00:52:15.350
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because it,</v>

948
00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.293
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

949
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.893
<v Speaker 2>because the ability do you use </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic systems is one of its </v>

950
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:21.344
<v Speaker 2>preconditions is that you're operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a domain where things are understood </v>

951
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 2>and shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

952
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.283
<v Speaker 2>so there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the response of your </v>

953
00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 2>emotional systems that are at least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

954
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:33.824
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mediated that outlined the manner in </v>

955
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:37.724
<v Speaker 2>which you respond to novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to talk about both of </v>

956
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:40.124
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the prefrontal cortex is very good </v>

957
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 2>for exploration and abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

958
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to lay out a bit of a brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

959
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.473
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is start to look at narrative </v>

960
00:52:52.431 --> 00:52:53.011
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

961
00:52:53.011 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you one more slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

962
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.770
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we,</v>

963
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:00.343
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now most of you have seen that probably </v>

964
00:53:02.871 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 2>a multiple times.</v>

965
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

966
00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:09.660
<v Speaker 2>but here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going along just fine.</v>

967
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Something emerges from the depths so to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>

968
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:16.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's some complex phenomena that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to,</v>

969
00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:19.590
<v Speaker 2>for invisible that made its </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation.</v>

970
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:23.310
<v Speaker 2>It knocks the validity out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>current mode of operation.</v>

971
00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And it plunges you into a place chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and complex,</v>

972
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.863
<v Speaker 2>where you flail about mostly a negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion depending on how radical the </v>

973
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 2>discontinuity is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if it's just a little one mile,</v>

974
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll find it exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's a big one,</v>

975
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're down there in the dumps,</v>

976
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long period of time.</v>

977
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Now with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is sort of piaget,</v>

978
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:46.343
<v Speaker 2>Eddie and idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do some exploration and some </v>

979
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 2>recategorize Zation you ingest the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that was associated with the</v>

980
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:54.594
<v Speaker 2>anomalous event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like the treasure that the </v>

981
00:53:56.431 --> 00:53:57.264
<v Speaker 2>dragon guards and then park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pop up and you have a new framework </v>

982
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:01.284
<v Speaker 2>of reference and it's better than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>old one in that it does everything the </v>

983
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 2>old one did.</v>

984
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Plus it accounts for the new thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought you down.</v>

985
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Now if you can't do that and you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit hard,</v>

986
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.733
<v Speaker 2>then you have something like post </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic stress disorder or an anxiety </v>

987
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:17.004
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm depression and you're stuck </v>

988
00:54:18.511 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 2>down there and chaos and the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you never get back up.</v>

989
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 2>So narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

990
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:28.680
<v Speaker 2>one point a to point B and here's how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

991
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Narrative to what do you do when your </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative falls apart?</v>

992
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a Meta narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The narrative falls apart.</v>

993
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:35.903
<v Speaker 2>You fall somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happens there that's </v>

994
00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:41.310
<v Speaker 2>transformative or not and then you pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>back out.</v>

995
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:42.323
<v Speaker 2>So the Meta narrative is a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the transformation of narratives </v>

996
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:47.123
<v Speaker 2>and it's the Meta narrative that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologies feature front and center </v>

997
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 2>because it's basically the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero myth.</v>

998
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.253
<v Speaker 2>The hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hero is the person who encounters </v>

999
00:54:57.301 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 2>the anomalous and the unknown at a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and place of their choosing.</v>

1000
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1001
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Garners the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the treasure that the anomalous</v>

1002
00:55:08.121 --> 00:55:13.121
<v Speaker 2>predatory thing guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's a full hero myth,</v>

1003
00:55:13.421 --> 00:55:16.450
<v Speaker 2>shares that with the community in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstitutes themselves.</v>

1004
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's the fundamental story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>

1005
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:24.860
<v Speaker 2>It's the fundamental story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you understand the categories,</v>

1007
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.430
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1008
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I think if you understand the categories</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the manner that I laid out,</v>

1009
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:32.993
<v Speaker 2>then you can understand those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is so cool because they're so </v>

1010
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:39.190
<v Speaker 2>powerful and they orient you properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1011
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.043
<v Speaker 2>it just demolishes the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nihilism and totalitarian belief </v>

1012
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.073
<v Speaker 2>inducing elements of moral relativism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the collapse of religious belief </v>

1013
00:55:49.351 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 2>systems because it can put some ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath your feet again,</v>

1014
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important,</v>

1015
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:54.594
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a defense against it theology and </v>

1016
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:57.084
<v Speaker 2>it's a get a defense against despair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are attractive forces and </v>

1017
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 2>nihilism in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like life is suffering.</v>

1018
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Why shouldn't you be cynical about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:12.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a real question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That question is no joke.</v>

1020
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get on with it.</v>

1021
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:13.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1022
00:56:13.711 --> 00:56:14.544
<v Speaker 2>That's not gonna help</v>

1023
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.960
<v Speaker 3>ideology because of it.</v>

1024
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1025
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:22.960
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

1026
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a defense against ediology </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

1027
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 2>it tells you something different about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of your being.</v>

1028
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how it works.</v>

1029
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 2>You can be locked in your first system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what the system is,</v>

1030
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you're locked in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an idiot log.</v>

1031
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Something comes along and blows your </v>
<v Speaker 2>system into bits.</v>

1032
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 2>You're in the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in chaos.</v>

1033
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:44.824
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're either an idiot log or pretend </v>

1034
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 2>protected or poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're blown into bits.</v>

1035
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then another identity you could </v>

1036
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:51.934
<v Speaker 2>have instead of the identity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial framework is you can have the </v>

1037
00:56:55.391 --> 00:56:59.300
<v Speaker 2>identity of being in chaos and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of a nihilist.</v>

1038
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fundamentally depressed,</v>

1039
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:01.744
<v Speaker 2>you're cynical about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for you to get motivated and </v>

1040
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:05.440
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's your identity.</v>

1041
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Or You could have the identity that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuilt after going through one of those</v>

1042
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 2>processes and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1043
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:14.860
<v Speaker 2>that'd be an improvement because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better identity than the previous one,</v>

1044
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.023
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly a lot more pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 2>than being neck deep in snakes and </v>

1045
00:57:19.691 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 2>lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1046
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:22.924
<v Speaker 2>so that's an improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a step that you can </v>

1047
00:57:24.791 --> 00:57:25.624
<v Speaker 2>take this further that's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is forget about identifying with </v>

1048
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:29.314
<v Speaker 2>the first stage or the second stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the collapse or the third </v>

1049
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all of that.</v>

1050
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Realize that you're the process of doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1051
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.033
<v Speaker 2>That's what you are fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to identify with what </v>

1052
00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 2>you believe and you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to identify with despair.</v>

1053
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.823
<v Speaker 2>You can identify with the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to terms with the world as it </v>

1054
00:57:54.311 --> 00:57:55.144
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you do embody that process if you </v>

1055
00:57:58.661 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

1056
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're engaged in that process.</v>

1057
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your engaged.</v>

1058
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>

1059
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 2>the systems that protect you against </v>
<v Speaker 2>despair and pain.</v>

1060
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically,</v>

1061
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 2>that would be the dopaminergic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primarily that thing is on.</v>

1062
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 2>You're in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a player,</v>

1063
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:20.074
<v Speaker 2>you're not the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that what religious </v>

1064
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:23.194
<v Speaker 2>stories attempt to teach people among </v>
<v Speaker 2>very many other things is that you're </v>

1065
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 2>not the bloody game and you're not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos of defeat.</v>

1066
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.173
<v Speaker 2>You're the player and you play many </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and the meaning is in the playing </v>

1067
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.593
<v Speaker 2>and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a platitude that is actually </v>

1068
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:45.430
<v Speaker 2>where the meaning is and the meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it real?</v>

1069
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more fundamental question is,</v>

1070
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:54.330
<v Speaker 2>is that meaning real enough to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>you from cynicism and nihilism?</v>

1071
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:59.500
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that is you have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out for yourself because no one can</v>

1072
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:00.334
<v Speaker 2>tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the stories can show you the way so </v>

1073
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:04.990
<v Speaker 2>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're there.</v>

1074
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:12.320
<v Speaker 4>When you said experience and what does </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mean?</v>

1075
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.733
<v Speaker 2>So Dostoyevsky's in the prison after </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting arrested by the czar's men and </v>

1076
00:59:20.881 --> 00:59:23.310
<v Speaker 2>then six in the morning after a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of weeks in his cell,</v>

1077
00:59:23.311 --> 00:59:25.620
<v Speaker 2>they take them out into the courtyard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shoot him with blanks.</v>

1078
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:27.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That moment when he's standing there </v>

1079
00:59:28.051 --> 00:59:28.884
<v Speaker 2>before he's going to be shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a religious experience and the </v>

1080
00:59:32.431 --> 00:59:34.680
<v Speaker 2>thing it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it overwhelmed him to such a degree that</v>

1081
00:59:34.681 --> 00:59:38.160
<v Speaker 2>it basically gave him epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like full,</v>

1082
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason I say that in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

1083
00:59:40.561 --> 00:59:41.394
<v Speaker 2>God is represented as the burning Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like don't get too close to that </v>

1084
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:45.414
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll,</v>

1085
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.093
<v Speaker 2>it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality that transcends your models </v>

1086
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.130
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about personified representations</v>

1087
00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:53.964
<v Speaker 2>of the day and for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality that transcends your models </v>

1088
00:59:57.121 --> 01:00:01.740
<v Speaker 2>is sufficient so that if you're exposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it at an untrammeled manner,</v>

1089
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:02.783
<v Speaker 2>it will hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might destroy you and it's not a </v>

1090
01:00:05.761 --> 01:00:06.594
<v Speaker 2>trivial sort of objective experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the law that rat feels when </v>

1091
01:00:12.571 --> 01:00:15.090
<v Speaker 2>it's trapped in the corner by a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>large cat,</v>

1092
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.460
<v Speaker 2>terrorist stands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1093
01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:19.470
<v Speaker 2>when you feel awe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

1094
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Your hair stands on end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1095
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:22.523
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the remnants of a prey </v>

1096
01:00:24.091 --> 01:00:25.530
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1097
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 4>also be enlightened.</v>

1098
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who wants that?</v>

1099
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your,</v>

1100
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:34.280
<v Speaker 2>your new age types and your Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 2>Campbell's,</v>

1101
01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:34.881
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1102
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

1103
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1104
01:00:36.681 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

1105
01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 2>if it was all good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would be doing it.</v>

1106
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:41.143
<v Speaker 2>It's not all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the major differences </v>

1107
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 2>say between the unions and the new age </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1108
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 2>the new age people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow your bliss.</v>

1109
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:48.711
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1110
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The union say,</v>

1111
01:00:50.691 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow what you're interested in.</v>

1112
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:53.444
<v Speaker 2>It will take you places you do not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go and you're not getting anywhere </v>

1113
01:00:56.961 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>until you go to those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everyone takes one look and says,</v>

1114
01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1115
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>that theory's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1116
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very,</v>

1117
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:05.804
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So enlightenment is down first and then </v>

1118
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>up and the more enlightened do you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>

1119
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the more you go down before you go up?</v>

1120
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Me Ask him that.</v>

1121
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.913
<v Speaker 2>That's a harder question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of what enlightenment is </v>

1122
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:24.960
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not hiding behind the shields of your</v>

1123
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Speaker 2>tentative belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1124
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Another way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1125
01:01:30.091 --> 01:01:30.924
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone with whom you </v>

1126
01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you're enlightened,</v>

1127
01:01:36.811 --> 01:01:37.644
<v Speaker 2>the more you'll listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise you have to prove to </v>

1128
01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.450
<v Speaker 2>them that the way you look at the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>is correct.</v>

1129
01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an enlightened stance.</v>

1130
01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:47.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a dogmatic and totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance.</v>

1131
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:48.331
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right,</v>

1132
01:01:48.331 --> 01:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

1133
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:50.963
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1134
01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.253
<v Speaker 2>Except if I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know what I'm writing about </v>

1135
01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:54.923
<v Speaker 2>and if you disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility that you </v>

1136
01:01:57.241 --> 01:01:58.074
<v Speaker 2>know something I don't like horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that possibility is so listening to </v>

1137
01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:03.744
<v Speaker 2>you would be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then another way of thinking </v>

1138
01:02:05.191 --> 01:02:07.320
<v Speaker 2>about that is you can think about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1139
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:13.320
<v Speaker 2>What's your friend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you know or what you don't know.</v>

1140
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.113
<v Speaker 2>And part of identifying with the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of transformation instead of the stages </v>

1141
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is understand that what you don't know,</v>

1142
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a more reliable friend than what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1143
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.083
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of it you're not going to </v>

1144
01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>run out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>

1145
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:29.460
<v Speaker 2>every time you encounter it </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully,</v>

1146
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.743
<v Speaker 2>the world becomes a more comprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and you become a more powerful </v>

1147
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1148
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you could be running around all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for little things that you don't</v>

1149
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>know makes you tough and awake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1150
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.014
<v Speaker 2>and if you're tough and awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't have to believe things </v>

1151
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>to make sense out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your life is so damn rich that you</v>

1152
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:48.781
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1153
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:49.614
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1154
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1155
01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny,</v>

1156
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:52.741
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1157
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can deal with that.</v>

1158
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to wish it away even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather it wasn't there.</v>

1159
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.043
<v Speaker 2>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can have my eyes open and </v>

1160
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:04.970
<v Speaker 2>see that and still think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1161
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 2>this is worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is worth continuing.</v>

1162
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:26.081
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1163
01:03:26.081 --> 01:03:27.640
<v Speaker 2>through experience and training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1164
01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it this way.</v>

1165
01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys just don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough life to figure everything out for</v>

1166
01:03:32.201 --> 01:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1167
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:34.841
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it,</v>

1168
01:03:34.841 --> 01:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life's too complicated.</v>

1169
01:03:36.701 --> 01:03:37.534
<v Speaker 2>Then you're too short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're life is too short and you're not </v>

1170
01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>that smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1171
01:03:40.691 --> 01:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And so unless you have guidance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously people have to be socialized,</v>

1172
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be socialized or they're </v>

1173
01:03:48.281 --> 01:03:49.114
<v Speaker 2>just ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is what's the end product </v>

1174
01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.280
<v Speaker 2>of the socialization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is well nihilistic,</v>

1175
01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
01:03:55.901 --> 01:03:56.734
<v Speaker 2>the other is the other is the person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has one foot in order in one foot in </v>

1177
01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:05.334
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a better place to be because </v>

1178
01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:10.340
<v Speaker 2>the world isn't just order and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just chaos</v>

1179
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:20.873
<v Speaker 3>scientific.</v>

1180
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that's what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century and that's what we're going</v>

1181
01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:30.194
<v Speaker 2>to take a look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like part of the re I told talk to you </v>

1182
01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:35.270
<v Speaker 2>guys about nature and his announcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the 19th century,</v>

1183
01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:35.841
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1184
01:04:35.841 --> 01:04:37.310
<v Speaker 2>So what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is announcing his,</v>

1185
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our new mode of thinking has invalidated</v>

1186
01:04:40.491 --> 01:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>our old modes of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not it.</v>

1187
01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like a mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a giant,</v>

1188
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like a murder of the most valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you can imagine.</v>

1189
01:04:48.711 --> 01:04:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That was his perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his observation was look out.</v>

1190
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause when something of that magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>dies,</v>

1191
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:59.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a big void and something's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take its place.</v>

1192
01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.270
<v Speaker 2>So what took its place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's pretty all of this.</v>

1193
01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean communist totalitarianism took </v>
<v Speaker 2>its place.</v>

1194
01:05:06.141 --> 01:05:08.360
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty much half the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't quite,</v>

1195
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:09.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrapped all the problems that were </v>

1196
01:05:10.011 --> 01:05:12.110
<v Speaker 2>associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

1197
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.720
<v Speaker 2>there's widespread nihilism and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1198
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>and like a pathological form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relativism.</v>

1199
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for neat chair,</v>

1200
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>those were the two options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like where else do you have to go?</v>

1201
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1202
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened and it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1203
01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:31.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of the things that Viktor </v>

1204
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:34.503
<v Speaker 2>Frankl said about his clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his clinical clients and Frankl was a </v>

1205
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 2>psych psychologist who'd been through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentration camps.</v>

1206
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that very frequently.</v>

1207
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>The problem that his clients came to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>about was the problem of meaning.</v>

1208
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.153
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think who was it that said he </v>

1209
01:05:50.871 --> 01:05:51.704
<v Speaker 2>opened his book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Camou the only </v>

1210
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:57.310
<v Speaker 2>philosophical question worth posing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why not commit suicide?</v>

1211
01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a little on the depressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

1212
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but if you ever talk to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about committing suicide,</v>

1213
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:03.544
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can come up with some pretty </v>

1214
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:07.360
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive answers for why that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable thing to do.</v>

1215
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:08.403
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't leap there from happy to </v>

1216
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 2>suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go through a lengthy process</v>

1217
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 2>of determining just exactly why suicide </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the appropriate option,</v>

1218
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're tremendously impulsive.</v>

1219
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And so to me it's like if we lose our </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounding in history,</v>

1220
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 2>given that were historical creatures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we lose the proper sense of identity,</v>

1221
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>then we're either going to be weak or </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

1222
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Those are the options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're weak,</v>

1223
01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you're dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're dangerous,</v>

1224
01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you're weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1225
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way it's not good.</v>

1226
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.433
<v Speaker 2>And I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is skipping ahead in the class </v>

1227
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:41.314
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to the degree that you think that </v>

1228
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.003
<v Speaker 2>existence is unbearable because if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless structure and it's implicit </v>

1229
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.594
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a big chunk of your </v>

1230
01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:56.131
<v Speaker 2>psyche that's wandering down genocidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and apocalyptic lanes.</v>

1231
01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's pointless misery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not put an end to it?</v>

1232
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.673
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think that people are </v>

1233
01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.654
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure that out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just not paying any attention </v>

1234
01:07:08.881 --> 01:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>because people are trying to figure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>out all the time.</v>

1235
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you read,</v>

1236
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:16.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1237
01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.900
<v Speaker 2>the brothers Karamazov I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best example of this.</v>

1238
01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky has a figure in the brothers</v>

1239
01:07:21.061 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Karamazov whose name is Ivan and Ivan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty vicious character.</v>

1240
01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:25.800
<v Speaker 2>He smart as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good looking.</v>

1241
01:07:25.801 --> 01:07:27.420
<v Speaker 2>He gets along well with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1242
01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's debonair,</v>

1243
01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:29.754
<v Speaker 2>Suave and he's a committed nihilist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a rational arguments to backup </v>

1244
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:37.710
<v Speaker 2>his nihilism like that are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful ones Dostoyevsky could invent.</v>

1245
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:38.993
<v Speaker 2>And so there are powerful enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's done as good a job as anybody </v>

1246
01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:45.930
<v Speaker 2>needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he puts forth a vicious argument for</v>

1247
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the pointlessness and essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>immorality of existence.</v>

1248
01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1249
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not.</v>

1250
01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.093
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of what I've been trying to </v>

1251
01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>figure out is how could it be possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ivan is wrong?</v>

1252
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1253
01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:15.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm trying to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these that we think</v>

1254
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.823
<v Speaker 3>of as archaic superstitions are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories about objective reality and </v>

1255
01:08:22.021 --> 01:08:24.720
<v Speaker 3>they're not archaic and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>superstitious.</v>

1256
01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:25.973
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already live by their dictates in </v>

1257
01:08:28.051 --> 01:08:29.910
<v Speaker 3>one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you know it or not.</v>

1258
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.313
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old stories are perennially </v>

1259
01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:37.110
<v Speaker 3>attractive to you and you need the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't live without them.</v>

1260
01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.460
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've tried to do is to figure out</v>

1261
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.823
<v Speaker 2>how they can be true while still </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing the other things that we know </v>

1262
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.094
<v Speaker 2>as modern people to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're trying to figure </v>

1263
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other questions,</v>

1264
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.043
<v Speaker 3>it's the actual stories themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to think of how can the </v>

1265
01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:07.530
<v Speaker 3>two religious stories be true?</v>

1266
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it means for them to be true.</v>

1267
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.593
<v Speaker 2>What that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things we've been </v>

1268
01:09:14.461 --> 01:09:15.294
<v Speaker 2>doing over the last three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's thinking what does it mean for </v>

1269
01:09:17.851 --> 01:09:20.640
<v Speaker 2>something to be true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a simple question.</v>

1270
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.133
<v Speaker 2>And one idea is that theories about </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective world are the only form of </v>

1271
01:09:26.401 --> 01:09:29.160
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not that.</v>

1272
01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:30.170
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't,</v>

1273
01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:34.710
<v Speaker 2>that can't be true because your problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how to act and you might say,</v>

1274
01:09:34.711 --> 01:09:35.544
<v Speaker 2>well that's not a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like at at that point in the </v>

1275
01:09:39.061 --> 01:09:39.894
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we start talking about what's real </v>

1276
01:09:42.061 --> 01:09:43.020
<v Speaker 2>and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1277
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.303
<v Speaker 2>It's such a deep question that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of your term starts to become </v>

1278
01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:48.083
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the most important </v>

1279
01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:53.730
<v Speaker 2>question that you have to answer is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>and why to live.</v>

1280
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's an episode nominal question.</v>

1281
01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.411
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1282
01:09:58.411 --> 01:09:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

1283
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is.</v>

1284
01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:03.983
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a proposition that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it's supported by the </v>

1285
01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:08.424
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you're going to be </v>

1286
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:11.370
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out while we go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>this course.</v>

1287
01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:15.900
<v Speaker 2>So other questions and if any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I don't,</v>

1288
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.080
<v Speaker 2>if I say don't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please tell me.</v>

1289
01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Because I know that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated thing to try to explain</v>

1290
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:31.220
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that structure of beliefs too,</v>

1291
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:38.990
<v Speaker 3>but actual religion dogma that goes with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1292
01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And people can take that more literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>as in the objective world.</v>

1293
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:47.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dogma is just the dominance </v>

1294
01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:51.940
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything has a dogmatic structure.</v>

1295
01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:53.980
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>

1296
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions are generally made out of a,</v>

1297
01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.053
<v Speaker 2>forget about religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belief systems have a dogmatic element </v>

1298
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and a transformative element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're always at war because one,</v>

1299
01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dogmatic element constraints,</v>

1300
01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:10.083
<v Speaker 2>the revelatory element and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelatory element undermines the </v>

1301
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're both necessary.</v>

1302
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of dialogue.</v>

1303
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:20.723
<v Speaker 2>It's the best way to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a dialogue and belief </v>

1304
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 2>systems between the structure and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of updating the structure.</v>

1305
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.013
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and any belief system can err too much </v>

1306
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:31.434
<v Speaker 2>one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only reason way that you can </v>

1307
01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>figure out if you're airing is by paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and,</v>

1308
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:39.030
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and communicating.</v>

1309
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.153
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you want a definition of </v>

1310
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:43.374
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know that's not a straight </v>

1311
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:46.344
<v Speaker 2>forward thing to do but I would say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that you have axioms of belief </v>

1312
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and your axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are are religious entities</v>

1313
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.210
<v Speaker 2>for you whether you know it or not cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hold them as absolutely true and,</v>

1314
01:12:03.581 --> 01:12:06.630
<v Speaker 2>and you have insufficient evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1315
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a cure could guardian idea,</v>

1316
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 2>you are by necessity a creature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

1317
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.033
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of you and there's a lot of the </v>

1318
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:21.411
<v Speaker 2>world and so you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions in order to move forward.</v>

1319
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:23.850
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't make assumptions.</v>

1320
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well when you crossed the street,</v>

1321
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:29.820
<v Speaker 2>you're making an assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The assumption is that the other side of</v>

1322
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:30.654
<v Speaker 2>the street is a better place to be than </v>
<v Speaker 2>this side of the street you're already </v>

1323
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.130
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an assumption.</v>

1324
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.473
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're going to get hit by a bus </v>

1325
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 2>as you cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know so much for that axiom,</v>

1326
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:42.563
<v Speaker 2>but you just can't move forward without </v>
<v Speaker 2>making assumptions because if you </v>

1327
01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:48.870
<v Speaker 2>question everything all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're paralyzed.</v>

1328
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:49.704
<v Speaker 2>You're in chaos.</v>

1329
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:55.660
<v Speaker 3>So wondering story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

1330
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.570
<v Speaker 3>the negative side and ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can be extreme.</v>

1331
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.033
<v Speaker 3>So taking that</v>

1332
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.110
<v Speaker 2>excellent question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1333
01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:14.690
<v Speaker 2>that's partly what we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a lot.</v>

1334
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the difference between,</v>

1335
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.353
<v Speaker 2>it's like the difference between surfing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being in a styrofoam bubble on a </v>

1336
01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:24.980
<v Speaker 2>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1337
01:13:24.981 --> 01:13:28.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a dynamic element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I say,</v>

1338
01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:28.904
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to identify with the </v>

1339
01:13:29.721 --> 01:13:32.230
<v Speaker 2>process of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1340
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.133
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that's all you should </v>

1341
01:13:34.251 --> 01:13:35.480
<v Speaker 2>identify with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1342
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a different question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might depend on where are you are and</v>

1343
01:13:40.011 --> 01:13:40.844
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and at what stage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life you are and all sorts of other </v>

1344
01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:46.760
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to the degree that you identify with</v>

1345
01:13:46.761 --> 01:13:49.340
<v Speaker 2>the process that transforms belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

1346
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.353
<v Speaker 2>you're not an idiot log.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that because in video </v>

1347
01:13:53.801 --> 01:13:55.460
<v Speaker 2>log is a totalitarian and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1348
01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 2>here's the bloody axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the system that generates,</v>

1349
01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:00.043
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not done and you've left </v>

1350
01:14:04.131 --> 01:14:04.964
<v Speaker 2>things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean you don't need </v>

1351
01:14:06.861 --> 01:14:08.660
<v Speaker 2>structure to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1352
01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:10.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tricky thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can say,</v>

1353
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.853
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm trying to communicate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the idea that it's better to </v>

1354
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize a belief system has a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of tools.</v>

1355
01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1356
01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.573
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fix a pipe with a pretty lousy </v>

1357
01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:26.200
<v Speaker 2>wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got tools at your disposal and</v>

1358
01:14:26.201 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't abandon them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thank God for the tools,</v>

1359
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can think of a better tool,</v>

1360
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 2>it's more power to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1361
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:58.530
<v Speaker 3>it seems like the religious stories</v>

1362
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:12.783
<v Speaker 2>might not help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might knock them right out of the </v>

1363
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:16.170
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing into a pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1364
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I've had fundamentalist Christians in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes before,</v>

1365
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1366
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.563
<v Speaker 2>and it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rattles them up pretty hard because </v>

1367
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 2>they implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of funny.</v>

1368
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.513
<v Speaker 2>They're sorta like the rational atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to think of the religious </v>

1369
01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 2>system as a theory about objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

1370
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:33.063
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny because they both share </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they both share the same priests </v>

1371
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1372
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:38.254
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I outlined evidence that it's not and </v>

1373
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:45.700
<v Speaker 2>that that often is extraordinarily hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their fundamentalist viewpoint.</v>

1374
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay with me.</v>

1375
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:48.454
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1376
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:02.240
<v Speaker 3>over time as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a culture.</v>

1377
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And then that probably affected the core</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the belief system.</v>

1378
01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:06.853
<v Speaker 3>The religions too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not even they're fully understanding </v>

1379
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:11.520
<v Speaker 3>what beliefs are actually helping them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their lives.</v>

1380
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not like,</v>

1381
01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:14.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of you people in this class or </v>

1382
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 2>uncover unconscious advocates of ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious ideas,</v>

1383
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:20.583
<v Speaker 2>like I don't care whether you know it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because otherwise you run into </v>

1384
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:25.084
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no absolute morality he </v>

1385
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 2>really meant if there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can do anything you want.</v>

1386
01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Everything's up for grabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>

1387
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:40.060
<v Speaker 2>do you run around doing anything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want?</v>

1388
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you don't because you're afraid.</v>

1389
01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:44.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1390
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you can take that avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1391
01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 2>That just puts it outside of the context</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this argument all together.</v>

1392
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Why do you act morally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should you,</v>

1393
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.500
<v Speaker 2>why shouldn't you lie to get what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want?</v>

1394
01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:57.603
<v Speaker 2>Or why should or should you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why shouldn't you steal to get what you </v>

1395
01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 2>want or killed to get what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1396
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.280
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be answers to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

1397
01:17:06.281 --> 01:17:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So obviously every three year old knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you lie carefully,</v>

1398
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 2>you can get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why not do it all the time?</v>

1399
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Why not practice it until you're great </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it?</v>

1400
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Like compulsive liar or sold to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

1401
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.393
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like I find that </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting that like people that do </v>

1402
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:32.370
<v Speaker 3>that or like other people see it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like really wrong.</v>

1403
01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've got a story for you.</v>

1404
01:17:34.621 --> 01:17:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So if you go on a chip bunch of chimps </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1405
01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:39.390
<v Speaker 2>in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you bring a snake in there,</v>

1406
01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.000
<v Speaker 2>even the plastic snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll all hit the ceiling,</v>

1407
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.583
<v Speaker 2>get away from that snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they'll look at it and look at </v>

1408
01:17:45.511 --> 01:17:46.320
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>

1409
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.153
<v Speaker 2>And if a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a chimp comes across a big snake in </v>

1410
01:17:48.721 --> 01:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a particular call they use,</v>

1411
01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:54.450
<v Speaker 2>which the primatologist caught a snake </v>
<v Speaker 2>rat,</v>

1412
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.310
<v Speaker 2>which is w r a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>h.</v>

1413
01:17:56.311 --> 01:17:57.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like the sound the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps make.</v>

1414
01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:58.973
<v Speaker 2>So they make this noise and then all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other chimps have come and they'll just </v>

1415
01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:03.660
<v Speaker 2>look at that snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they stay a fair distance from it,</v>

1416
01:18:03.661 --> 01:18:04.494
<v Speaker 2>but they'll look at it and look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at it and look at it for hours </v>

1417
01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>and hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like dexter,</v>

1418
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:12.490
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1419
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.160
<v Speaker 2>The serial killer contemptible object </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ever eternally fascinating.</v>

1420
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It's the same sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1421
01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:25.490
<v Speaker 2>And so there's discussed and attraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

1422
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.133
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1423
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:36.490
<v Speaker 3>there's a relationship with Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lack of not being able to feel</v>

1424
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 2>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

1425
01:18:39.741 --> 01:18:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So I Alexithymia is a hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric condition.</v>

1426
01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the consists of the inability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate emotional states.</v>

1427
01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:49.063
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question because it depends </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the degree to which your personality </v>

1428
01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.850
<v Speaker 2>has to be articulated in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

1429
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I would propose to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1430
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 2>and this is partly why we're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises that we're doing,</v>

1431
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>is that just like imagine that if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>joints weren't articulated,</v>

1432
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:09.260
<v Speaker 2>not very helpful cause you could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of slap things with your hands,</v>

1433
01:19:09.261 --> 01:19:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like pause,</v>

1434
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.473
<v Speaker 2>but they're fully articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a conceptual relationship </v>

1435
01:19:14.961 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>between articulated speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulation.</v>

1436
01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.373
<v Speaker 2>Articulated speech means that your tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>for dealing with the world are more </v>

1437
01:19:21.651 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 2>differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving acting in the world.</v>

1438
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:27.230
<v Speaker 2>And so the more you can articulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1439
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.780
<v Speaker 2>the more of you there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the world there is.</v>

1440
01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>

1441
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.160
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're without terms for emotions,</v>

1442
01:19:34.161 --> 01:19:35.420
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn hard to communicate.</v>

1443
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.273
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you say some of the new age </v>

1444
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:39.584
<v Speaker 4>concepts that the objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that we're living right now in </v>

1445
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 4>terms of yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mate.</v>

1446
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:48.283
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe standing before for bliss and </v>

1447
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:53.110
<v Speaker 4>falling intuition and trying to tap it.</v>

1448
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1449
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:56.660
<v Speaker 2>a big part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big part of the new age movement is in</v>

1450
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:59.880
<v Speaker 2>fact a reaction against rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>style Islam.</v>

1451
01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So to that degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some utility in it.</v>

1452
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:07.340
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's sort of like protestantism,</v>

1453
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 2>the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is all good.</v>

1454
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Well no wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not even close to right.</v>

1455
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>The world is a horrible place and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are terrible creatures.</v>

1456
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.530
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1457
01:20:21.531 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Cause the world is also a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and people are amazing creatures.</v>

1458
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:28.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's another answer to the</v>

1459
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 2>ideology question too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in my understanding,</v>

1460
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 2>a philosophy that unites the opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a union idea,</v>

1461
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.650
<v Speaker 2>is not an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an ideology.</v>

1462
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:41.723
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are despoiling the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western culture does nothing but rape </v>

1463
01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>and pillage and nature is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1464
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 2>innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virginal victim.</v>

1465
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:54.751
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1466
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.584
<v Speaker 2>that's all true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only half true because human </v>

1467
01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:03.450
<v Speaker 2>beings are all also unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and remarkable creatures.</v>

1468
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:06.270
<v Speaker 2>And it's no bloody wonder that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to survive.</v>

1469
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:07.104
<v Speaker 2>And that has costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thank God for culture because </v>

1470
01:21:09.391 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it was minus 10 last night,</v>

1471
01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:12.174
<v Speaker 2>so we'd all be popsicles and nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing everything it possibly can in </v>

1472
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>every moment to destroy and undermine </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1473
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1474
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.160
<v Speaker 2>you want an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pick the first one,</v>

1475
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 2>that's an environmental ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one is like a frontier myth.</v>

1476
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:28.223
<v Speaker 2>So you put them together and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is terrible and beautiful and </v>

1477
01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:33.870
<v Speaker 2>culture is tyrannical and provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

1478
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 2>And the human being is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 2>a remarkable exploratory hero and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely satanic figure.</v>

1480
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got the whole thing not </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite.</v>

1481
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.214
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's one other category that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sort of like the category from </v>

1482
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 2>which all those categories emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very low level category.</v>

1483
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:52.733
<v Speaker 2>But as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a system that has representations of </v>

1484
01:21:57.541 --> 01:22:02.220
<v Speaker 2>those classes of phenomena is not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

1485
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that's partly why it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so damn hard to get rid of Freud because</v>

1486
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 2>freud categories map onto that map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1487
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:10.734
<v Speaker 2>there's the Ed that's sort of nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great source of energy and it's </v>

1488
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the ego.</v>

1489
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 2>The Ego is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 2>pretty good thing with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird troubles and pathologies.</v>

1491
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:25.560
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the Super Ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is society.</v>

1492
01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 2>You need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're out of control.</v>

1493
01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 2>But it can also be a crushing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical force.</v>

1494
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.433
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't get rid of Freud because </v>

1495
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:33.660
<v Speaker 2>he got story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1496
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.970
<v Speaker 2>And you might argue about is categories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>

1497
01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.980
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't really matter because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're grounded in,</v>

1498
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.190
<v Speaker 2>in something deeper than the terms that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud used.</v>

1499
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you see Christ,</v>

1500
01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:47.400
<v Speaker 2>any Disney movie that that's worth its </v>
<v Speaker 2>salt has all of those characters in it.</v>

1501
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.533
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it gets one sided like frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an absolutely dismal and </v>

1502
01:22:51.001 --> 01:22:51.834
<v Speaker 2>wretched movie.</v>

1503
01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:52.983
<v Speaker 2>It was meant the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Disney is pretty good at </v>

1504
01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:57.120
<v Speaker 2>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but frozen frozen was pure radiology.</v>

1505
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:58.583
<v Speaker 2>So it was very annoying to see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in most situations the Disney </v>

1506
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 2>movies are pretty good at balancing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the archetypes.</v>

1507
01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.243
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the reason there's </v>

1508
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once insanely popular know,</v>

1509
01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 2>they present an architectural picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1510
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1511
01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1512
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any religious beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say that to yourself.</v>

1513
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:17.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1514
01:23:17.111 --> 01:23:17.944
<v Speaker 2>why do you watch Disney movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell do you think you're doing </v>

1515
01:23:19.721 --> 01:23:20.554
<v Speaker 2>in the theater?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's a religious </v>

1516
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:22.774
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just cause you're completely </v>

1517
01:23:23.861 --> 01:23:25.960
<v Speaker 2>clueless about what religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences are.</v>

1518
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.200
<v Speaker 2>You're watching a bunch of pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their drawings,</v>

1519
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that aren't even real.</v>

1520
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>And then you're just in there like </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in there.</v>

1521
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 2>It's got your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

1522
01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:42.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in any of that.</v>

1523
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:42.671
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1524
01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:43.504
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1525
01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 3>So come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe in it</v>

1526
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:03.670
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1527
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.681
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1528
01:24:04.681 --> 01:24:05.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1529
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem underneath that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a bit deeper because like,</v>

1530
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the dominance hierarchies real </v>
<v Speaker 2>period real,</v>

1531
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:14.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1532
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird structure cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1533
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:20.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1534
01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:20.974
<v Speaker 2>it's like the example I gave earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's the tunnel and the train </v>

1535
01:24:24.881 --> 01:24:25.714
<v Speaker 2>going through it and the train keeps at </v>
<v Speaker 2>any moment the train cars are full of </v>

1536
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:31.540
<v Speaker 2>different things with dominant Turkey is</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like that.</v>

1537
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a dissipative structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tell you.</v>

1538
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So a dissipative structure is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1539
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:38.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you let the water go out of a drain</v>

1540
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.320
<v Speaker 2>and you get that coil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that funnel.</v>

1541
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a thing?</v>

1542
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant across a series of </v>

1543
01:24:46.951 --> 01:24:47.784
<v Speaker 2>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dissipative structure and the </v>

1544
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:53.550
<v Speaker 2>physicist Schrodinger regarded people as</v>
<v Speaker 2>dissipative structures.</v>

1545
01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.460
<v Speaker 2>So because we're our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1546
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 2>our structure isn't constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1547
01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:58.283
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've probably replaced every cell in </v>

1548
01:24:59.131 --> 01:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

1549
01:25:00.241 --> 01:25:02.550
<v Speaker 2>or at least the constituent elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>air resell,</v>

1550
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:03.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three times since you've been </v>

1551
01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:06.330
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there you are.</v>

1552
01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:07.403
<v Speaker 2>So you're like this thing that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent structure in a flux and the </v>

1553
01:25:11.161 --> 01:25:15.270
<v Speaker 2>doormen hierarchy sport sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because the constituent elements of</v>

1554
01:25:15.271 --> 01:25:16.830
<v Speaker 2>it keep changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1555
01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:20.520
<v Speaker 2>existence is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its existence is there.</v>

1556
01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.360
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't exactly know what to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a category like that,</v>

1557
01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:27.210
<v Speaker 2>except that I'm certainly going to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's real.</v>

1558
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.433
<v Speaker 2>Or if you don't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say I don't care if it's real </v>

1559
01:25:30.481 --> 01:25:33.360
<v Speaker 2>because all of you act as if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that's more real than that.</v>

1560
01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:36.600
<v Speaker 2>So that'll do for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1561
01:25:36.601 --> 01:25:37.434
<v Speaker 2>that brings up another question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what someone regards is </v>

1562
01:25:40.381 --> 01:25:41.214
<v Speaker 2>real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one answer is while you listen to </v>

1563
01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 2>what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1564
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:46.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1565
01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:52.460
<v Speaker 2>You watch what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a much more accurate guide to who</v>

1566
01:25:53.311 --> 01:25:56.430
<v Speaker 2>they are because what do they know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they are?</v>

1567
01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.013
<v Speaker 2>They got a vague model of who they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's usually hyper tilted towards </v>

1568
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:01.703
<v Speaker 2>banality and conformity and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection and deceit and all sorts of </v>

1569
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:10.154
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1570
01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.693
<v Speaker 3>Hurricane,</v>

1571
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:22.240
<v Speaker 2>well [inaudible] like a hurricane is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissipative structures.</v>

1572
01:26:22.241 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1573
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable analogy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit is often likened to the wind.</v>

1574
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so any other questions?</v>

1575
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:31.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1576
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:35.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an appalling ideology because the </v>

1578
01:26:41.311 --> 01:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>people who created it had the idea about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it should be before they made it.</v>

1579
01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.533
<v Speaker 2>So it's propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say exactly what frozen is </v>

1580
01:26:48.481 --> 01:26:50.670
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's propaganda.</v>

1581
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:56.220
<v Speaker 2>A truly mythologically based story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never fully say what it's about.</v>

1582
01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.120
<v Speaker 2>You can just talk about it forever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever and ever and ever.</v>

1583
01:27:00.150 --> 01:27:02.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wellspring of meaning.</v>

1584
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.153
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1585
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:09.511
<v Speaker 2>oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

1586
01:27:09.511 --> 01:27:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1587
01:27:10.921 --> 01:27:13.230
<v Speaker 2>it's calculated marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1588
01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:14.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1589
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It was hyper politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1590
01:27:18.121 --> 01:27:18.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1591
01:27:18.661 --> 01:27:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't need men and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1592
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.650
<v Speaker 2>give me a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1593
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.830
<v Speaker 2>just because you need men doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like them.</v>

1594
01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1595
01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>so I mean I've thought a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between propaganda and art.</v>

1596
01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>So art is actually a process rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>an end product.</v>

1597
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a piece of art,</v>

1598
01:27:39.991 --> 01:27:42.660
<v Speaker 2>the process is embedded in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>byproduct.</v>

1599
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And so it reflects the process when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it into your house.</v>

1600
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1601
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.463
<v Speaker 2>it's a crystallized act of exploration </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the real artist doesn't know what </v>

1602
01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:56.070
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what they're doing.</v>

1603
01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>They're exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1604
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.433
<v Speaker 2>I can recommend a film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a film made of Picasso Wooden </v>

1605
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Boat in 1957 and it was a black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white film and it was actually a film of</v>

1606
01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:05.154
<v Speaker 2>him making a painting and he painted it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on glass so you could see what he was </v>

1607
01:28:08.191 --> 01:28:08.460
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1608
01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.000
<v Speaker 2>It's really quite fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that he's playing,</v>

1609
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.130
<v Speaker 2>he sketches it in and then he rubs it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1610
01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.013
<v Speaker 2>So then he's sketches it in again and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubs it out and he sketches over here </v>

1611
01:28:17.101 --> 01:28:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there's a real dynamism </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1612
01:28:19.531 --> 01:28:20.364
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't plan it out to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that there's necessarily anything </v>

1613
01:28:22.921 --> 01:28:24.850
<v Speaker 2>wrong with that as an artistic endeavor </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1614
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:25.953
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Gasa was trying to explore and </v>

1615
01:28:27.601 --> 01:28:28.434
<v Speaker 2>understand and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you know about cubism </v>

1616
01:28:30.991 --> 01:28:33.630
<v Speaker 2>but cubism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange thing.</v>

1617
01:28:33.631 --> 01:28:38.631
<v Speaker 2>But what he was doing with his cubism </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to try to show you that you only see</v>

1618
01:28:38.731 --> 01:28:39.564
<v Speaker 2>things from one perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the things exist in multiple </v>

1619
01:28:42.781 --> 01:28:44.400
<v Speaker 2>perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1620
01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:48.870
<v Speaker 2>a cubist painting is your face this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your face this way at the same time.</v>

1621
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well is that a more accurate way of,</v>

1622
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:54.990
<v Speaker 2>of representing a person that just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard portrait.</v>

1623
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.823
<v Speaker 2>And Picasso would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in some ways definitely because it </v>

1624
01:28:58.531 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 2>captures the transformative element </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather the static element.</v>

1625
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 2>And so someone who's a true artist </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a political message.</v>

1626
01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.293
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny cause my house is full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological propaganda from the Soviet </v>

1627
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just packed full of it.</v>

1628
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:14.303
<v Speaker 2>And it's so interesting to watch these </v>
<v Speaker 2>artifacts because a lot of them were </v>

1629
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.400
<v Speaker 2>there socialist realist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although mostly they're impressionist.</v>

1630
01:29:20.401 --> 01:29:21.234
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting to watch them </v>

1631
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 2>because in that painting themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a war that you can perceive.</v>

1632
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.553
<v Speaker 2>And the war is a lot of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>made these paintings were incredibly </v>

1633
01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:33.060
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1634
01:29:33.061 --> 01:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>really skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the Russians kept their,</v>

1635
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>their formal academy's open so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians can really paint impressionism.</v>

1636
01:29:39.451 --> 01:29:40.284
<v Speaker 2>It's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But their talents were encapsulated </v>

1637
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:45.900
<v Speaker 2>within this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly stellar in this ideology.</v>

1638
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:47.003
<v Speaker 2>And so in each canvas there's this war </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the ideological message and the </v>

1639
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:53.370
<v Speaker 2>artistic message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's so cool is the farther we get</v>

1640
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 2>away from the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the art wins.</v>

1641
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Because in 300 years there isn't gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a shred left of that ideology.</v>

1642
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And all they'll will be left to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paintings is the art.</v>

1643
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.083
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1644
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:07.763
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to art is because the artist </v>

1645
01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 2>actually manifests identity with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of transformation.</v>

1646
01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why the artist is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural hero.</v>

1647
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That's also why every nihilist worth his</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt wants to be an artist.</v>

1648
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Like who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna say?</v>

1649
01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm an ils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

1650
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:26.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1651
01:30:26.221 --> 01:30:28.110
<v Speaker 2>no you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can see why you want to be.</v>

1652
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1653
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just cause you're a failure.</v>

1654
01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:32.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're an artist.</v>

1655
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it depends on who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to me.</v>

1656
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 2>But I'm really interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1657
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.593
<v Speaker 2>and I'm also interested in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>etiologies coopt more fundamental </v>

1658
01:30:56.431 --> 01:31:00.900
<v Speaker 2>processes to two and harness their </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy as a,</v>

1659
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:06.170
<v Speaker 2>as a rational and motivating force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

1660
01:31:06.451 --> 01:31:11.451
<v Speaker 2>these pieces of art propaganda are </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely interesting.</v>

1661
01:31:12.511 --> 01:31:13.344
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting to be surrounded </v>

1662
01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 2>by them because I can see this war going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on all the time.</v>

1663
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.673
<v Speaker 2>So it's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are twinning far as I can </v>

1664
01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:23.544
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's very interesting because they </v>

1665
01:31:25.921 --> 01:31:27.990
<v Speaker 2>were pure propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them when I bought them.</v>

1666
01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.990
<v Speaker 2>But it's getting farther and farther </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the Soviet Union.</v>

1667
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.430
<v Speaker 2>So the more architectural elements are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to the forefront.</v>

1668
01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.053
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1669
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it would depend on the skill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the artist,</v>

1670
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:48.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these artists are incredibly</v>

1671
01:31:48.551 --> 01:31:51.630
<v Speaker 2>skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the degree that there are,</v>

1672
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:55.210
<v Speaker 2>there's genuine artistic merit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting,</v>

1673
01:31:55.450 --> 01:32:00.370
<v Speaker 2>regardless of its constraint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can itself is value.</v>

1674
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1675
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>So any other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1676
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 2>So while you basically know where we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed.</v>

1677
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to start telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories in the next class,</v>

1678
01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 2>a little more neural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little neuroscience,</v>

1679
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 2>and then a lot of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
