1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Things I've been thinking about here </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

2
00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know why I hadn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized this before,</v>

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but you realize things in stages is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this model,</v>

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>this hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a model of the unconscious,</v>

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>so when people talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.303
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the procedural unconscious </v>

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>that's at the lowest level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.113
<v Speaker 1>Because that's movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be procedural memory and </v>

9
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.494
<v Speaker 1>then the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchies above that are </v>

10
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.334
<v Speaker 1>representational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them more or liberty or called </v>

11
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>kinetic melodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be</v>

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.613
<v Speaker 1>habitual patterns of behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've mastered strung together in a </v>

13
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.364
<v Speaker 1>novel way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then above that that starts to </v>

14
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>become representational and so I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're digging to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

16
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:49.734
<v Speaker 1>when you're having a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious opens up in the </v>

17
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.424
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which almost always happens if you're </v>

18
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>having a dispute with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you really mean?</v>

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.873
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to decompose what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying into its subsidiary </v>

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>elements and sometimes that's a search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's actually,</v>

22
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did that idea come from?</v>

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>What is the underlying structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

24
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so keep that in mind.</v>

25
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.413
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.263
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about play last time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the fact that even </v>

27
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>animals have rules for play and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the evidence,</v>

28
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.623
<v Speaker 1>that's evidence that there are modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction between animals in a social </v>

29
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>environment that are acceptable to both </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>such that they will voluntarily continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>and such that they aren't so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.933
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Piagetian observation that that </v>

33
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>constitutes one of the basis of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of moral behavior.</v>

34
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful insight because it takes,</v>

35
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>it takes the idea that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary about morality.</v>

36
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It takes that out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

37
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's malleable,</v>

38
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's not arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.933
<v Speaker 1>it can't just be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that still leaves you with the </v>

40
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>problem of how large the boundaries are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tough one because obviously</v>

41
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:07.284
<v Speaker 1>you all know that there are many ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play that all function as acceptable </v>

42
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:12.534
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

43
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.673
<v Speaker 1>Although one of the rules would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who's playing the game </v>

44
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>actually has to agree to play it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

45
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:19.554
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an absolute rule regarding social </v>

46
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

47
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.223
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a process rule rather than a </v>

48
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>content rule to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

49
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>That's still important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

50
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>so now I believe we talked a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about friends.</v>

51
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>The walls work with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned that what the wall has </v>
<v Speaker 1>found out is that it isn't just the,</v>

53
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the caveman chimp with the biggest club </v>

54
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.873
<v Speaker 1>who's the top chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that top champ in a hierarchy that </v>

55
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:48.114
<v Speaker 1>remains relatively stable and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get torn to shreds by his </v>

56
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>subordinates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be an absolute tyrant.</v>

57
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.224
<v Speaker 1>There are social conventions that he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to follow and those seem to involve the </v>

58
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>ability to form coalitions with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>males.</v>

59
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.053
<v Speaker 1>So there's a cooperative element and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then also attention to the females and </v>

60
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the infants that are in the chimp troupe</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

61
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it seems to indicate is that the </v>

62
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.931
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated the top guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in chimps it's usually a guy,</v>

63
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.983
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always a guy in chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more sophisticated he is in his </v>

64
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>social maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more stable the result and hierarchy</v>

65
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and so what that implies as we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed is that there are,</v>

66
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.913
<v Speaker 1>there are differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualitative between hierarchies and </v>

67
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a moral hierarchy.</v>

68
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Some function better than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some you have to define better,</v>

69
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's reasonable to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

70
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Again from a modified Cooney and Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 1>had perspective.</v>

71
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>You say better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better system is one that does all the</v>

72
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.794
<v Speaker 1>functions of the previous system plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or that it's more stable or </v>

73
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can define better.</v>

74
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.943
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

75
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.453
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

76
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 1>this particular</v>

77
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.193
<v Speaker 1>pictorial representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to transmute this into into </v>

78
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:18.090
<v Speaker 1>another dimension of representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got here,</v>

79
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:23.091
<v Speaker 1>you've got your high dominant primate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he,</v>

80
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he represents something if he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant,</v>

81
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.113
<v Speaker 1>what he represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dominance and we're associating </v>

82
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:34.080
<v Speaker 1>dominance to some degree with competence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the competence is social competence.</v>

83
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.233
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern that constitutes acceptable </v>

84
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:39.114
<v Speaker 1>dominant side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could think about that as </v>

85
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.420
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

86
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.343
<v Speaker 1>People especially rather simple minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social critics like to think that </v>

87
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies are only based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

88
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.063
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's except in the most brutal of </v>

89
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not the case because there's</v>

90
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.333
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also competence and lots of </v>

91
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.883
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in a functional society are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on competence and so what's </v>

92
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>at the top isn't dominance precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's authority and authority is a better</v>

93
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about it.</v>

94
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>how is our authority represented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also what is it?</v>

96
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.973
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine that for app chimp or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe for now we'll go with chimp </v>

97
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.243
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know how long ago it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in history when people started to </v>

98
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>abstract out these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

99
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.863
<v Speaker 1>if you think of a word like chief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as there's a word like that </v>

100
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>chief isn't or tribal leader or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term might be.</v>

101
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that term exists indicates</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a category for authority.</v>

102
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that as soon as </v>

103
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.374
<v Speaker 1>you have a category for authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can detached the idea of authority </v>

104
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>from the authority holder and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to think about itself right?</v>

105
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>In a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a troop,</v>

106
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.764
<v Speaker 1>like in a chimp troupe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no authority independent of the </v>

107
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>thing that's at the top.</v>

108
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>It's completely embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you might be able to say,</v>

109
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>if you are an anthropological observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to say,</v>

110
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some common,</v>

111
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.973
<v Speaker 1>here's a chimp true here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a chimp true peer and </v>

112
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>another one here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could say,</v>

113
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.783
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some commonality and behavior </v>

114
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>across all of the chimps that are at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>

115
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but the chimps don't know that it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a natural fact at that point,</v>

116
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.083
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you can make the category</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the category leader something like </v>

117
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.684
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you're starting to do is to </v>

118
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the principles that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority authority.</v>

119
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>So and that's because we can abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because we can represent.</v>

120
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing that for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

121
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that as modern people all the </v>

122
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

123
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge body of studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies in management,</v>

124
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>science about what makes a leader.</v>

125
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that it's very,</v>

126
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:54.464
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to go into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and extract out anything of </v>

127
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>any generality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense,</v>

129
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.283
<v Speaker 1>my sense was in reviewing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature that one of the things you </v>

130
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>can say about a leader is that a leader </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows where he's going,</v>

131
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.610
<v Speaker 1>but once you go past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

132
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.493
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes leadership in complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>human organizations is hard to </v>

133
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.564
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also rather situation </v>

134
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

135
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.194
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say there's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of being a leader that are </v>

136
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>dependent on temperament that maybe all </v>
<v Speaker 1>be functional.</v>

137
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So trying to categorize that as quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

138
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:32.894
<v Speaker 1>but people still have been trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for a very long time and they've </v>

139
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone a very long way.</v>

140
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.443
<v Speaker 1>So here's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the symbolic transmutation in </v>

141
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

142
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

143
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
<v Speaker 1>at the left top left there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got people playing football and </v>

144
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>then in the middle there you've got an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract representation of a game.</v>

145
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.153
<v Speaker 1>So computer games are quite interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've taken the whole </v>

146
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>abstraction process one step further </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

147
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Representations of representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation so you can play with them</v>

148
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>and their simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the ones on the,</v>

149
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>on the on the far right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom one,</v>

150
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:09.764
<v Speaker 1>you see there's a guy standing down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and he's gazing up at God and </v>

151
00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>heaven with this cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

152
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>And to me that essentially a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is that.</v>

153
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

154
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>

155
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you're looking up to see the source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

156
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's the idea that authority is </v>
<v Speaker 1>above you.</v>

157
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Somehow I would say that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation is an attempt to capture </v>

158
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>an image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What authority constitutes.</v>

159
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.783
<v Speaker 1>Now when people were capturing this an </v>
<v Speaker 1>image like they are in that particular </v>

160
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.144
<v Speaker 1>drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that they were trying to put </v>

161
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>into images something they understood in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an articulated way.</v>

162
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.133
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena itself of authority as a </v>

163
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>concept emerged on the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes we've been describing,</v>

164
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:54.914
<v Speaker 1>which means that it emerged from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom up as as as increasingly complex </v>

165
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.504
<v Speaker 1>social animals organize themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly complex and large social </v>

166
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.154
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an emergence and emergence of </v>

167
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>morality as a consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

168
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And then there was an observation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

169
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what form would that observation take?</v>

170
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.693
<v Speaker 1>And it's a union hypothesis and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good one that part of what </v>

171
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:27.171
<v Speaker 1>the artistic endeavor does is transmute </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not understood yet into image,</v>

172
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.393
<v Speaker 1>image and drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the source of its further </v>

173
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>articulation up into stateable rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for so,</v>

174
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.903
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom picture there indicates that </v>

175
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>a human being can be struck by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of authority per se.</v>

176
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might think,</v>

177
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>well what's even more of an authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>than an authority?</v>

178
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.423
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it's whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes authorities authorities across a </v>

179
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>large class if authorities and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

180
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>well what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

181
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:02.010
<v Speaker 1>while we're still figuring that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so damn complicated,</v>

182
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:02.844
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can tell you some things about </v>

183
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:07.254
<v Speaker 1>that image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you some things that it </v>

184
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that first of all,</v>

185
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.214
<v Speaker 1>it means that authority has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal process that's </v>

186
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's eternal.</v>

187
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why is that?</v>

188
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because what makes authority </v>

189
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>authority is stable across hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies can come and go,</v>

190
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.963
<v Speaker 1>but the concept itself has an eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>element to it because it remains </v>

191
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>constant across transformations and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's represented in the symbolic</v>

192
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>realm by the idea of God in heaven.</v>

193
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to tell you to.</v>

194
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to reduce these religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations to the concepts that I'm </v>

195
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:45.654
<v Speaker 1>describing because I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm telling you is a complete </v>

196
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:48.894
<v Speaker 1>representation of what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a transcendent element to </v>

197
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.364
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain away by by reducing it to its </v>

198
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

199
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:00.924
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to put that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to make it as </v>

200
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>concrete as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in this representation,</v>

201
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>the idea basically is that authority has</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with the father,</v>

202
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has something to do with eternity and</v>

203
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:17.050
<v Speaker 1>transcendence and it also has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with the cross.</v>

204
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 1>It's Christian representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>

205
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothesis is what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a weird hypothesis,</v>

206
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:24.774
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at that picture and you </v>

207
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>start thinking about it from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropological perspective instead of a</v>

208
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>personal perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

209
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.504
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are these creatures up to </v>

210
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>when they're making representation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

211
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>It's what are they trying to express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and the classical view would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

213
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a belief and the belief is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposed on the viewers.</v>

214
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:45.421
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

215
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not assume that.</v>

216
00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try something different.</v>

217
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that it's an explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have been trying to work out</v>

218
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.303
<v Speaker 1>that nobody really understands and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's a much better way of </v>

219
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 1>looking at it because otherwise you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck with some bloody conspiracy theory</v>

220
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.520
<v Speaker 1>of history or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.363
<v Speaker 1>and I think one of the advantages we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in the 21st century is because our </v>

222
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 1>culture now is composed of such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermingling of cultures.</v>

223
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.663
<v Speaker 1>It enables people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for the sake of argument in </v>

224
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:16.444
<v Speaker 1>the dominant culture to step outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own presuppositions and start to </v>

225
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>view themselves as anthropologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

226
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:22.781
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 1>what are people up to?</v>

228
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

229
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 1>that figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry it's not bigger,</v>

230
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:27.994
<v Speaker 1>but I'll show you a bigger one later is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being held up in heaven by angels so it </v>

231
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

232
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's an idea that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

233
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.723
<v Speaker 1>There is some divine entities out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which a top divine entity emerges and </v>

234
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:42.544
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a father figure in that </v>

235
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:44.434
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with light and it has </v>

236
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:47.974
<v Speaker 1>this cross and the cross is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old symbol and so and in </v>

237
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Christianity obviously the cross isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the father.</v>

238
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:56.914
<v Speaker 1>It's representative of the sun and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because what that </v>

239
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>means is this representation says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever authority is,</v>

240
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 1>has something of the father and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of the son,</v>

241
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.893
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to become very </v>

242
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:10.984
<v Speaker 1>relevant when I tell you the Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the fundamental variance of </v>

243
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the central Egyptian religious story a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit later in class.</v>

244
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just the farther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something else.</v>

245
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And one of the mysteries about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity for example,</v>

246
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rationalist.</v>

247
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's always take Christianity to task </v>
<v Speaker 1>four is the idea that God is a,</v>

248
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a three part unity.</v>

249
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 1>What's very bizarre idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and obviously it's not an empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

251
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.053
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's some bizarre fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's expressed quite well </v>

252
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>in that drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least part of it,</v>

253
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

254
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.933
<v Speaker 1>it's a unity because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar about the father in the son and </v>

255
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:49.534
<v Speaker 1>there's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they both need from each other and </v>

256
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:52.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a dynamic interplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also has to be something that's </v>

257
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:55.924
<v Speaker 1>differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's utility in differentiating the </v>

258
00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

259
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so keep that in mind.</v>

260
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Now the top one there on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Moses,</v>

261
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you the story of exodus in</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail later in the class,</v>

262
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to introduce you to is this possibility.</v>

263
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in exodus basically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

264
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a tyranny descend into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rise story,</v>

265
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a,</v>

266
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.433
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exodus story is a microcosm of the </v>

267
00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 1>entire Christian Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>

268
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story about transformation nested</v>

269
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>inside a broader story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

270
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.813
<v Speaker 1>The transformation is everyone's in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and they're being exploited and </v>

271
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>they need to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

272
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.714
<v Speaker 1>so you should be able to relate to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody is in a tyranny and </v>

273
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:48.514
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the degree to which the tyranny is </v>

274
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical varies a lot between </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>

275
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.613
<v Speaker 1>but the classic adolescent experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see this and coming of age </v>

276
00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all at the time,</v>

277
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 1>is the young person against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment,</v>

278
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

279
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's an existential,</v>

280
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>that's an existential condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the young person against,</v>

281
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>against the establishment.</v>

282
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the establishment is also helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>the young person,</v>

283
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.990
<v Speaker 1>so it's not the only story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

284
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>It's an architectural component of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

285
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.673
<v Speaker 1>so you have to escape from the tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the group and what happens when you </v>

286
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>escape from that is your cast into chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a tyrannical group,</v>

287
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:34.331
<v Speaker 1>because even a tyrannical group provides</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with a hierarchy and an identity and</v>

288
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a pathological hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pathological identity,</v>

289
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.793
<v Speaker 1>but you could still make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better than no identity at all and </v>

290
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I think you play that situation by </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

291
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean remember what happens to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel lights,</v>

292
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:49.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They leave Egypt,</v>

293
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.833
<v Speaker 1>they were all slaves there and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in a desert and they're </v>

294
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>wandering around in the desert for 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and lot of them are thinking,</v>

295
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.883
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so obvious that this chaotic </v>

296
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.674
<v Speaker 1>existence out here in a desert is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than where I know my three meals a day </v>

297
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:05.924
<v Speaker 1>are coming from and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to think about that is </v>

298
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>merely something that's an abstraction.</v>

299
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's plenty of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia who long for the Soviet Union.</v>

300
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there were,</v>

301
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 1>there was a stability that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>

302
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Now we would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the Russians themselves said</v>

303
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.203
<v Speaker 1>that was a pathological stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether it was worse than the </v>

304
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 1>consequent chaos is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

305
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it's to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to be seen.</v>

306
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>We don't know at the moment for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies like Poland,</v>

307
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 1>so like Poland seems to have pulled out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it quite nicely,</v>

308
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but there are other countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't.</v>

309
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>So the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is also the conundrum.</v>

310
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:46.184
<v Speaker 1>It's very much thing we're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because you might think what </v>

311
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.424
<v Speaker 1>stops people from progressing in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the quality of their personality </v>

312
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

313
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.943
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you want to move forward you </v>

314
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>have to let something go and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegration associated with that.</v>

315
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And so that's somewhat terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like maybe you find,</v>

316
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>well the case of the abused spouse is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good one.</v>

317
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Why go back to someone who abuses you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people usually do and.</v>

318
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because,</v>

319
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couples abuse each other all the time,</v>

320
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's a matter of degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

321
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:24.194
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go out on the spectrum to the </v>

322
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>point where it's pretty damn obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the abuse is criminal,</v>

323
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.174
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's sort of the bordering </v>

324
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will still return.</v>

325
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why really hard question why sometimes </v>

326
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 1>it's because the abuser conspires to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the abused person isn't a</v>

327
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 1>position of such weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they actually can't leave.</v>

328
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>They have no money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no.</v>

329
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

330
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>that's that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

331
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.404
<v Speaker 1>what do you give up when you leave while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give up everything you give up your </v>

332
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:01.240
<v Speaker 1>because you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeez,</v>

334
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.143
<v Speaker 1>that was a mistake and that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>require a lot of thinking through to </v>

335
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 1>figure out why you made that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and how not to make it again,</v>

336
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:09.564
<v Speaker 1>because you probably will because </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever got you into that situation to </v>

337
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 1>begin with is undoubtedly still there </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you fixed it.</v>

338
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And then of course your future is shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And so as your present self image and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a chaotic collapse,</v>

340
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might mean that you have to move </v>

341
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows you have to change jobs,</v>

342
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to change where you live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to change all your friends.</v>

343
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that better?</v>

344
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not obviously,</v>

345
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and so people won't take the leap off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the burning,</v>

346
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the burning grasslands on the cliff into</v>

347
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:41.004
<v Speaker 1>the water below and it's not surprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who knows how many sharks are </v>

348
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:45.294
<v Speaker 1>down there and that it's really useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>to to understand it that way I think </v>

349
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:54.201
<v Speaker 1>because it tells you why people won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend themselves constantly.</v>

350
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:54.991
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

351
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to make a sacrifice and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

352
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not always obvious that the sacrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the gain you will make,</v>

353
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.993
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice is worth the costs of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and that's even in extreme </v>

354
00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

355
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why exit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such an archetypal story.</v>

356
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:09.444
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not obvious at all to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel lights when they're out in the </v>

357
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:12.414
<v Speaker 1>desert wandering about half starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's only faith that keeps them </v>

358
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.264
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith that there might be something </v>

359
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 1>better at the other end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

360
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.343
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is that they get pretty </v>

361
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:26.550
<v Speaker 1>damn crabby at Moses for leading them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

362
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:27.384
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start to worship all sorts of </v>

363
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 1>alternative gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you do when you're</v>

364
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:35.460
<v Speaker 1>in chaos by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you're in chaos,</v>

365
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for new moral principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Orient Yourself by,</v>

366
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are new hierarchies of value.</v>

367
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And to think about those as alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures of,</v>

368
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dominant structures of value that </v>

369
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:48.834
<v Speaker 1>could be represented by a given daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly reasonable thing to do </v>

370
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.703
<v Speaker 1>is especially in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated knowledge of what a moral </v>

371
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:56.574
<v Speaker 1>structure is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfectly reasonable way to </v>

372
00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:58.824
<v Speaker 1>represent it.</v>

373
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.903
<v Speaker 1>So that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Israelites are trying to orient </v>

374
00:20:01.681 --> 00:20:02.514
<v Speaker 1>themselves on this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the hell you're </v>

375
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.643
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing happens that's </v>

376
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

377
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.444
<v Speaker 1>they're all squabbling among each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you a story about </v>

378
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:14.010
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So among the,</v>

379
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushmen,</v>

380
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.663
<v Speaker 1>the Kalahari Bushman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way look to be the most </v>

381
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:21.594
<v Speaker 1>genetically similar of all human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what our earliest relatives would </v>

382
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>have been who moved out of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

383
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:28.884
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kalahari Bushmen are very </v>

384
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian society and people like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that egalitarian societies,</v>

385
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>because they were Galitary Ian are </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>

386
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:39.834
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not peaceful at all and neither </v>

387
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 1>is the Bushman society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with the bushmen society</v>

388
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:45.984
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

389
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say art and whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

390
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still my wife,</v>

391
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's no hierarchy.</v>

392
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.950
<v Speaker 1>So what am I going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no authority to appeal to,</v>

393
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>so I'm stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what am I going to do?</v>

394
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often I'm just going to wait around </v>

395
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:03.930
<v Speaker 1>until I get my chance and then I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take out my little bow and Arrow with</v>

396
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 1>a poisoned Arrow and I'm going to nail </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with it because what else is there?</v>

397
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

398
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 1>this is what the Bushman do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting is that there's another</v>

399
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>tribe located near them and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the band too,</v>

400
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.153
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not absolutely certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the band and they have </v>

401
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:21.394
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is an authority and so now the </v>

402
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:24.904
<v Speaker 1>Bushman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to the band to to have their </v>

403
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.310
<v Speaker 1>disputes mediated so they don't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to shoot each other when,</v>

404
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>when they have an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

405
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>

406
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's we're thinking about because in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flat egalitarianism society,</v>

407
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.543
<v Speaker 1>nobody has the final word and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's getting along that's </v>

408
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 1>perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as two people aren't getting</v>

409
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

410
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 1>who do we turn to to mediate this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So the Israelites had that problem in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal story.</v>

412
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:51.694
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses is that every time to Israelites </v>

413
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.420
<v Speaker 1>have some squawk about who's chicken is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's.</v>

414
00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:59.643
<v Speaker 1>They have to come to Moses and they pour</v>
<v Speaker 1>out their tale of woe and he has to sit </v>

415
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:04.534
<v Speaker 1>there and listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he has to decide who's right </v>

416
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's serving as a judge.</v>

417
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you're judging,</v>

418
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 1>which is a word that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

419
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.271
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

420
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.280
<v Speaker 1>don't judge me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

421
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.993
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the same as not </v>

422
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:21.064
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

423
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging is actually an extraordinarily </v>

424
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:24.334
<v Speaker 1>useful ability because it helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate out what isn't good for </v>

425
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 1>anything from what's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it isn't absence of judgment.</v>

426
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's judicial judgment,</v>

427
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Principled judgment.</v>

428
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is that?</v>

429
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

430
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.531
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

431
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Speaker 1>it's all arbitrary anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you've just got chaos.</v>

432
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's not much of a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

433
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So the Israelites are coming to Moses </v>
<v Speaker 1>like nonstop bitching about these little</v>

434
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:55.060
<v Speaker 1>trivial things that are aggravating them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death and he's sitting there like for</v>

435
00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally for years,</v>

436
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>listening to them like 14 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally he does miss it so long that</v>

437
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:03.664
<v Speaker 1>I think it's his father in law who tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>him he has to stop and distribute the </v>

438
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because he's just going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get exhausted.</v>

439
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.010
<v Speaker 1>But you can imagine what happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sit there and judge and judge and</v>

440
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:16.084
<v Speaker 1>judge and judge and judge and judge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge is that you're building up a very </v>

441
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:20.824
<v Speaker 1>articulated and differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the moral structure </v>

442
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:27.070
<v Speaker 1>that actually constitutes your society.</v>

443
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Because imagine if you're a good judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what has to happen.</v>

444
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You two are at each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a really homicidal way,</v>

445
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.943
<v Speaker 1>so things have gone too far and so then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to listen to you both and I have </v>

446
00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:41.704
<v Speaker 1>to decide what you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to do something even more </v>

447
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 1>spectacular than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to decided in a way that you both</v>

448
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:50.864
<v Speaker 1>feel is more acceptable than killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and that means you have to </v>

449
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:55.604
<v Speaker 1>feel that not only is it is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and just it also has to </v>

450
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:01.544
<v Speaker 1>absolve you of your responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>seek revenge because that's one of the </v>

451
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:07.180
<v Speaker 1>functions of law that people never think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

452
00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not remember this because you're</v>

453
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:10.934
<v Speaker 1>all young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when Michael Dukakis I'm hoping was </v>

454
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:18.821
<v Speaker 1>running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody asked him what he would do.</v>

455
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>They were having it Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a democrat.</v>

456
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.173
<v Speaker 1>He had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had let some character out of jail </v>

457
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:25.694
<v Speaker 1>and he went and killed someone and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans made a big deal out of </v>

458
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:33.870
<v Speaker 1>that during the presidential convention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there isn't a rape involved as</v>

459
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.723
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was asked on tv what he would do if </v>

460
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:40.130
<v Speaker 1>his own wife was raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:40.964
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty good question and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>cactus blue the answer because he w he </v>

462
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.500
<v Speaker 1>kind of wishy washy did way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 1>so the right answer is with every fiber </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my being,</v>

464
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:56.351
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to chop them into bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a civilized person I'm willing to</v>

465
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.704
<v Speaker 1>defer that to the judicial system </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'll take appropriate and </v>

466
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:03.314
<v Speaker 1>measured steps and then my proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't generate itself through the </v>

467
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:09.974
<v Speaker 1>community because the danger is if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>take vicious revenge that that'll start </v>

468
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:14.384
<v Speaker 1>a cycle of revenge and then the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing falls apart and so it's the </v>

469
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:17.864
<v Speaker 1>judicial system's responsibility to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moral burden off my shoulders </v>

470
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:22.634
<v Speaker 1>because you know what's the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>response when someone you love this </v>

471
00:25:25.331 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 1>terribly hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll it's not,</v>

472
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just forget about that and go home.</v>

473
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.163
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your contempt to billy week </v>

474
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.434
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the judicial system has to stand in </v>

475
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

476
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:37.814
<v Speaker 1>the point is if you make a judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judgment won't hold unless it suits </v>

477
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>the people who are being judged and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to suit them unless it matches</v>

478
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.190
<v Speaker 1>the implicit moral presuppositions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already bringing to the dispute.</v>

479
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you see this in kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the kids will be arguing over a</v>

480
00:25:55.881 --> 00:26:00.050
<v Speaker 1>toy and then they'll come to the mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the father and they'll say,</v>

481
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>and then the mother will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

482
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you do this and you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the kids don't like that,</v>

483
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.251
<v Speaker 1>they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

484
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids like,</v>

485
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really obsessed with fair.</v>

486
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>They want exactly fair in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable way.</v>

487
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 1>So the parent not only has to adjudicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dispute,</v>

488
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:20.384
<v Speaker 1>but the parent has to adjudicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute in a manner that the children </v>

489
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>will accept.</v>

490
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll just go back into the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and have the fight all over again.</v>

491
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll poke each other.</v>

492
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be,</v>

493
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 1>there'll be tit for tat revenge going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstop.</v>

494
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.063
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of the </v>

495
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:41.801
<v Speaker 1>solution has to match the embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation of the population.</v>

496
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's already a morality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>governing their interactions.</v>

497
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there wasn't,</v>

498
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't even know when they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been wronged.</v>

499
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't figure out when you're</v>

500
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you know when you're not wrong.</v>

501
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I've been wronged means to say,</v>

502
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on here,</v>

503
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:02.514
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then Pearl Moses has to look at </v>

504
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 1>that and he has to think about it and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to think,</v>

505
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 1>well why is this fair and why is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair and who is right here?</v>

506
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.603
<v Speaker 1>And then what's the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story represents him as doing </v>

507
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:14.424
<v Speaker 1>that for the $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take someone to become an </v>

508
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 1>absolute expert at doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the story,</v>

509
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>what the story essentially relates is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the revelation of a moral code.</v>

510
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Ten Commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

511
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

512
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 1>they say the 10 commandments came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

513
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Well that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of have an idea about God that's</v>

514
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>already stemming from the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>

515
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.240
<v Speaker 1>so it's the abstract representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the source of authority</v>

516
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:39.294
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

517
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Moses,</v>

518
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>he has this bright revelation which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a moment of insight.</v>

519
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens in psychotherapy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a moment of insight is that you</v>

520
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:51.384
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you've already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you figure out what you're already </v>

521
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:55.704
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens because you come to </v>

522
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>the therapist and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

523
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I had this relationship and this is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it went.</v>

524
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

525
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.863
<v Speaker 1>this relationship and it went the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and this relationship and it went </v>

526
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

527
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:08.244
<v Speaker 1>And so then you talk about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it and talk about it until </v>

528
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:11.700
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

529
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.623
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the explanation that maps onto </v>

530
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 1>the behavior and it feels like a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

531
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's the insight moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

532
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.063
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

533
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I do dream interpretation fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly and you know,</v>

535
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.383
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of like astrology and </v>

536
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.893
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable objection </v>

537
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>except that it's more like literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and you think,</v>

538
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:37.914
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know when you've got it </v>

539
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

540
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insight like you,</v>

541
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you talk about it and all of a sudden it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of crystallizes the person goes,</v>

542
00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fits go.</v>

543
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you figure that out.</v>

544
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't get it exactly.</v>

545
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

546
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:00.893
<v Speaker 1>when you get the map right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that there's an </v>

547
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how that generalizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>across situations.</v>

548
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 1>And so partly that simplifies the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

549
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

550
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:13.950
<v Speaker 1>well here's the rule instead of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to act it out on stage.</v>

551
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>come with a,</v>

552
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.303
<v Speaker 1>with a burst of insight is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler and more efficient and so your </v>

553
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:22.730
<v Speaker 1>body recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

554
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.813
<v Speaker 1>Recognizes it as an optimal solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it also opens up new </v>

555
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 1>possibilities for the future and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you a dopamine kick.</v>

556
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.573
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that moment of insight is </v>

557
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>associated with this really potent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective marker.</v>

558
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's a revelation when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of insight.</v>

559
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people even say that.</v>

560
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Now we might not think anymore that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a divine revelation,</v>

561
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation of sufficient magnitude,</v>

562
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it was one way up in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction hierarchy,</v>

563
00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:58.953
<v Speaker 1>if you had a revelation at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would describe it as a religious </v>

564
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do all the time.</v>

565
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 1>It's happens to alcoholics all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when their recovery,</v>

566
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.203
<v Speaker 1>you know they have a flash of insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when a new personality gets </v>

567
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 1>catalyzed and if that happens to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they can stop drinking.</v>

568
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

569
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is outdated because I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature 25 years ago,</v>

570
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:21.454
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt it because we haven't made </v>
<v Speaker 1>really any progress in treating </v>

571
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelatory,</v>

572
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

573
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>cures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism.</v>

574
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know necessarily know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring in about,</v>

575
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.154
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 12 step programs try to bring it </v>

576
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.010
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

577
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about all that.</v>

578
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.613
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bigger representation of the </v>

579
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's authority.</v>

580
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 1>What is authority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

581
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a now I'm hoping it's been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while since I looked at these pictures.</v>

582
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that picture</v>

583
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that picture is a way.</v>

584
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.873
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good step duray and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Moses receiving the tablets from </v>

585
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong,</v>

586
00:31:02.631 --> 00:31:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's light to associate.</v>

587
00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:06.524
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

588
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.143
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

589
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't know that they knew it.</v>

590
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.470
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what to do</v>

591
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.520
<v Speaker 1>or even necessarily why they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wronged.</v>

592
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.160
<v Speaker 1>They just have a sense that this wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

593
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way to think about that</v>

594
00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:31.430
<v Speaker 1>is to think about five-year-olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know when somebody breaks a rule,</v>

595
00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.220
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bug really bugs them.</v>

596
00:31:34.221 --> 00:31:37.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a phd and observation too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not playing by the rules.</v>

597
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.160
<v Speaker 1>That's enough to make many young kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>cry.</v>

598
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.503
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they're crying and you think </v>

599
00:31:42.351 --> 00:31:44.960
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's a distress call,</v>

600
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.273
<v Speaker 1>that's it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a request for the intervention of </v>

601
00:31:49.611 --> 00:31:51.500
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what crying is,</v>

602
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.083
<v Speaker 1>so the kid knows something's gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His pattern detection system is not </v>

603
00:31:56.691 --> 00:31:57.524
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his capacity to represent that and </v>

604
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:00.664
<v Speaker 1>articulate it well from a Ph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and perspective that doesn't come </v>

605
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:05.900
<v Speaker 1>until multiple stages of development </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

606
00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:06.734
<v Speaker 1>like the highest level of development </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of people according to Piaget </v>

607
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:10.820
<v Speaker 1>don't even get there.</v>

608
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would be the ability to to play</v>

609
00:32:14.631 --> 00:32:15.464
<v Speaker 1>games with the rules of games and so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that when you were having a </v>

610
00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:19.844
<v Speaker 1>constitutional discussion for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe when you're talking with your </v>

611
00:32:23.421 --> 00:32:24.254
<v Speaker 1>friends on the playing field about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules are going to be for a pickup </v>

612
00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:27.944
<v Speaker 1>football game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're so you can conceptualize </v>

613
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:31.934
<v Speaker 1>yourself at that point as not only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that is good because that thing </v>

614
00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:39.050
<v Speaker 1>can follow rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an earlier stage of,</v>

615
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.783
<v Speaker 1>but that as a thing that's good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only can it follow rules that can </v>

616
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:44.504
<v Speaker 1>abstractly represent the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can engage in a discussion about the </v>

617
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:48.224
<v Speaker 1>rules and I can update them and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's part of what's being </v>

618
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:52.214
<v Speaker 1>represented by this picture on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the father is the thing that's the </v>

619
00:32:55.461 --> 00:32:56.294
<v Speaker 1>rules and the son in this representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that can update the rules </v>

620
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 1>now it has to die and come back in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to update the rules.</v>

621
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.283
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why the the father </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that figure is holding a cross </v>

622
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 1>because the cross is a symbol of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reconstruction.</v>

623
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.023
<v Speaker 1>That's the price you pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reformatting the rules because you have </v>

624
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:18.950
<v Speaker 1>to do that to yourself too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Yep.</v>

625
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.863
<v Speaker 3>Value in the extraction is not to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game which actually pay attention </v>

626
00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:29.214
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

627
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:30.863
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the advantage of abstract </v>

628
00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:34.134
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can start to manipulate the </v>

629
00:33:35.821 --> 00:33:39.120
<v Speaker 1>representations before you manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

630
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So that means you can start to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about morality.</v>

631
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a good thing?</v>

632
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Alfred North Whitehead.</v>

633
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:49.523
<v Speaker 1>I hate taping these because all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors that I'm making in my memory </v>

634
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.130
<v Speaker 1>going to be preserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

635
00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Alfred North Whitehead </v>
<v Speaker 1>who said something like,</v>

636
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.453
<v Speaker 1>the reason to think the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought is valuable is because we can </v>

637
00:34:04.721 --> 00:34:07.060
<v Speaker 1>let our thoughts die instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

638
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:08.621
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

639
00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:09.431
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

640
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:12.010
<v Speaker 1>once you can lay out the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

641
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.453
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

642
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the kids are playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One kid cheats or,</v>

643
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 1>or another kid suspects the first kid is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheated and there's,</v>

644
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no adults around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

645
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

646
00:34:26.301 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>one outcome is the game stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a high probability outcome or the</v>

647
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:32.084
<v Speaker 1>game continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's having any fun or one kid </v>

648
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 1>gets resentful and Solomon and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid just oppose,</v>

649
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.420
<v Speaker 1>imposes his will or they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

650
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:44.294
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when they can abstractly represent </v>

651
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 1>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

652
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 1>they can agree on them before they play </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game and kids do that automatically.</v>

653
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>So if for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch kids play pretend games,</v>

654
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.193
<v Speaker 1>what they do first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably all remember this from </v>

655
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:00.110
<v Speaker 1>when you were little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

656
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 1>you're playing some pretend game in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket fort or something.</v>

657
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get together with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other kids and you think,</v>

658
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:07.424
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is your role in this is your </v>

659
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>role and that's your role and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what we're going to do.</v>

660
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's going to be the little drama will</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out.</v>

661
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Some kids are very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you can get the rules abstracted,</v>

662
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about the damn things </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having to kill each other and</v>

663
00:35:22.971 --> 00:35:23.804
<v Speaker 1>you can also update them in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run simulations of what would happen </v>

664
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.194
<v Speaker 1>with the update,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what an argument is </v>

665
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 1>or a debate and then you can implement </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

666
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:35.024
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully you can get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid updates before you actually </v>

667
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Speaker 1>implement them and die because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented them.</v>

668
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.973
<v Speaker 1>And so the other advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction either in drama or in </v>

669
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:51.621
<v Speaker 1>articulation is that you can transfer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules more or more efficiently.</v>

670
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 1>So you can get the kid to act out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule,</v>

671
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:55.044
<v Speaker 1>but you can also say here's the rule and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should follow it in multiple </v>

672
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.751
<v Speaker 1>situations and then they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn purely through imitation to embody</v>

673
00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:05.640
<v Speaker 1>that rule across all possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

674
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:11.030
<v Speaker 1>So whatever advantages abstraction has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pulling out of the more rural system</v>

675
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>from the underlying behavior has those </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages and disadvantages.</v>

676
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:16.344
<v Speaker 1>The disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you can come up with a perfectly </v>

677
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:19.974
<v Speaker 1>good reason why you shouldn't keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your forefathers have done for 20 </v>

678
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:23.950
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it does.</v>

680
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

681
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:31.170
<v Speaker 1>you can easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Mesopotamians last week we</v>

682
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:32.004
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the noisy God's killed app </v>

683
00:36:35.571 --> 00:36:36.404
<v Speaker 1>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the hell he was good </v>

684
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:38.720
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

685
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's there shield against chaos.</v>

686
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He's their tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

687
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:44.340
<v Speaker 1>well we'll just kill them and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

688
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:45.174
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better be careful because lurking </v>

689
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:47.994
<v Speaker 1>behind your tradition is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know you might be the master of </v>

690
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're probably not.</v>

691
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.603
<v Speaker 1>So look out now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got some clue from the Mesopotamians </v>

692
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 1>what the master of chaos was like.</v>

693
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.473
<v Speaker 1>The master of chaos was a new kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God who had eyes all the way around his </v>

694
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 1>head who could speak magic words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a.</v>

695
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:07.613
<v Speaker 1>there's an attention verbalization </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication element to that and the </v>

696
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians figured out that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be at the top.</v>

697
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Now that's it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

698
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's staggering insight to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it also might be right.</v>

699
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:21.534
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

700
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 1>what should you follow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

701
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the first answer is follow the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

702
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

703
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:28.884
<v Speaker 1>because that's what people expect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't get into too much trouble if </v>

704
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might say,</v>

705
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the rules are wrong,</v>

706
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes they don't apply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

707
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>

708
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

709
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 1>in the Mesopotamians would say that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good time to pay attention and to</v>

710
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:48.444
<v Speaker 1>confront the chaos voluntarily and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate about what you're doing and </v>

711
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:52.884
<v Speaker 1>to reformat the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restructure the world as a consequence </v>

712
00:37:55.501 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 1>of your confrontation with this chaos.</v>

713
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a higher daddy.</v>

714
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the god of attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

715
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:04.590
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more,</v>

716
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 1>it's attention plus articulation plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

717
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.563
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the highest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Mesopotamians would say that's </v>

718
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>the highest God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothesis.</v>

719
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So to the degree now I wanted to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the rest of the Mesopotamian story.</v>

720
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.373
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you remember that Margaret goes off </v>

721
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and conquers tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt puts it into net,</v>

722
00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 1>cuts it into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the world okay.</v>

723
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:28.164
<v Speaker 1>And then out of Time Matt has organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>this army to go against Marduk and his </v>

724
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and his and and his army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what time does,</v>

725
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 1>when she goes out to have a war is she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the forefront.</v>

726
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:41.783
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sort of behind the scenes </v>

727
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering and manipulating everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she puts,</v>

728
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 1>she creates this like all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>

729
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The worst monster she can think up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then have all those monsters.</v>

730
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:52.683
<v Speaker 1>She picks the worst possible monster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she puts him at the head of the Phalanx </v>

731
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.920
<v Speaker 1>that goes into battle and his name is </v>
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>

732
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And so martin defeats him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like a,</v>

733
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a bit of a precursor of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

734
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the agent of chaos,</v>

735
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but he's more embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

736
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:10.323
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martik makes human beings out of the </v>

737
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:13.294
<v Speaker 1>blood of king new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also extraordinarily </v>

738
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:16.264
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very much like the idea in </v>

739
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.103
<v Speaker 1>genesis that was picked up particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Catholics that human beings are </v>

740
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 1>characterized by original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

741
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>We're made out of the blood of the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

742
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>and I took me a long time to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

743
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

744
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

745
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.363
<v Speaker 1>why would they think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason is is that </v>

746
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:40.651
<v Speaker 1>because human beings are the only things</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet that can deceive you,</v>

747
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

748
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Like everything else is either the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is or you just don't understand it.</v>

749
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the garbage can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He isn't trying to deceive you.</v>

750
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 1>There's things about it you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand like at subatomic structure,</v>

751
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not actively fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 1>your comprehension.</v>

752
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Whereas human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are completely different creatures</v>

753
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:01.444
<v Speaker 1>and it's definitely the case that along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our capacity for abstraction and </v>

754
00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:05.884
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we immediately evolved the ability for </v>

755
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 1>high level intrigue and deception and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even see that in kids,</v>

756
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.683
<v Speaker 1>the smarter the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earlier they learn to lie and you </v>

757
00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:17.680
<v Speaker 1>can see that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

758
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.543
<v Speaker 1>You can't separate that from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to spin off alternative </v>

759
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 1>simulated worlds because that's what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie is,</v>

760
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.320
<v Speaker 1>except if you're doing it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalized manner,</v>

761
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.163
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to spin off a world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually represents the real world </v>

762
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:32.944
<v Speaker 1>better instead of trying to spin off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation that allows you to avoid </v>

763
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:38.530
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for something.</v>

764
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.320
<v Speaker 1>So I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting that you know,</v>

765
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:42.154
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very cognizant of the fact that </v>

766
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.604
<v Speaker 1>there is something in human beings which</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fundamentally the capacity for </v>

767
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:49.234
<v Speaker 1>deceitful and evil auction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was also something that really has </v>

768
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.073
<v Speaker 1>to be contended with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also assumed that Marduk was </v>

769
00:40:55.511 --> 00:40:57.890
<v Speaker 1>the master of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

770
00:40:57.891 --> 00:41:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It was very implicit in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

771
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor,</v>

772
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.493
<v Speaker 1>so the emperor lived in a walled city </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cities were world at that time </v>

773
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that was if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't Walden,</v>

774
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.283
<v Speaker 1>the marauding barbarians would come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kill all the men and take all the </v>

775
00:41:13.661 --> 00:41:16.270
<v Speaker 1>women and burned the place to the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and steal everything.</v>

776
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.553
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people weren't all that happy when that </v>

777
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:20.104
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they built big walls to make sure </v>

778
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>that that was difficult.</v>

779
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.280
<v Speaker 1>So that was order inside the walls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos outside and chaos was out were the</v>

780
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 1>barbarians are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still what we think.</v>

781
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.113
<v Speaker 1>But what would happen to the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New Year's ceremony was that they </v>

782
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>would take them outside the city wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take the emperor who's like king</v>

783
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:40.634
<v Speaker 1>of order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take them outside into chaos to </v>

784
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 1>remind them that even the emperor could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

785
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:47.204
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

786
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.123
<v Speaker 1>is surrounded by chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they strip them of all the </v>

787
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 1>clothing and symbols that made him </v>
<v Speaker 1>emperor and they'd make a meal.</v>

788
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And then the priest would make him </v>
<v Speaker 1>recount for the last year.</v>

789
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 1>All the things he did that made him not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good mark.</v>

790
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.253
<v Speaker 1>So he was supposed to embody Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what made him the emperor to </v>

791
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:11.174
<v Speaker 1>the degree that he could embody the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attentive and communicated forest that </v>

792
00:42:14.151 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 1>could keep chaos at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deserved to be emperor.</v>

793
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea of sovereignty,</v>

794
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of lawful sovereignty.</v>

795
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

796
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.453
<v Speaker 1>They take him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is is the emperor might </v>

797
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:29.390
<v Speaker 1>forget that he's supposed to be Marduk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he might just be,</v>

798
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:30.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy with the biggest heroin who's </v>

799
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:32.144
<v Speaker 1>stealing everything he possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really not what he's supposed </v>

800
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:35.414
<v Speaker 1>to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take them outside at the New </v>

801
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Year's festival when the world was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be renewed,</v>

802
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 1>which we still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

803
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Because it's out with the old year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the new,</v>

804
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 1>that's when you make your resolutions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a better person.</v>

805
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is an ancient ceremony.</v>

806
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out you take the emperor,</v>

807
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 1>strip him of his emperor close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he's just some dude.</v>

808
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:57.643
<v Speaker 1>You have a kneeling there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll walk them with a glove to just </v>

809
00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>remind him that he's not boss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

810
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you get them to recount all his</v>
<v Speaker 1>sins basically,</v>

811
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:07.483
<v Speaker 1>but the sins were okay in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you fail in your task as a </v>

812
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.094
<v Speaker 1>representative of Martech on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the emperor hypothetically </v>

813
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 1>would tell everybody why he was allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and useless in six different ways and</v>

814
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:22.904
<v Speaker 1>promise to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Mesopotamians would take </v>

815
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 1>statues out of the city that represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods that we've talked about,</v>

816
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and they would reenact the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk against chaos.</v>

817
00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd act that out.</v>

818
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end the emperor would </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep with a ritual prostitute like.</v>

819
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:40.244
<v Speaker 1>So she'd be like a temple virgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the benevolent element of </v>

820
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:47.750
<v Speaker 1>femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then then they'd go back in and have</v>

821
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:48.584
<v Speaker 1>their year start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very much like St George and </v>

822
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

823
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the Saint George and the Dragon</v>

824
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>St George Goes,</v>

825
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 1>a dragon has captured a virgin and St </v>
<v Speaker 1>George is out there.</v>

826
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He's going to slay the dragon and free </v>
<v Speaker 1>the virgin.</v>

827
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And that works at multiple levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis simultaneously.</v>

828
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:05.234
<v Speaker 1>One level is the guy who's best at </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping chaos at bay is going to be the </v>

829
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:12.470
<v Speaker 1>guy who was most attractive to women </v>
<v Speaker 1>because women are smart,</v>

830
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:13.603
<v Speaker 1>so that's first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the architectural level or </v>

831
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.260
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sorry.</v>

832
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.123
<v Speaker 1>That's the biological level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The architectural level is even more </v>

833
00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:24.780
<v Speaker 1>abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the dragon tie,</v>

834
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.633
<v Speaker 1>Matt is a representation of chaos itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos is something that's deeply </v>

835
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:30.944
<v Speaker 1>informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dragon has gold or it has a </v>

836
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 1>virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how the story works out.</v>

837
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.553
<v Speaker 1>When you encountered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you free something of value and that's </v>

838
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.360
<v Speaker 1>something that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can incorporate,</v>

839
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more like the treasure variant of</v>

840
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:46.314
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also good if you kind of spread it </v>

841
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 1>around a little bit so because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incomplete story.</v>

842
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening?</v>

843
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 1>What's happening in Mesopotamia at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

844
00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 1>his many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many tribes are being brought together.</v>

845
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 1>They've all got their own mythology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's trying to figure out,</v>

846
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:03.864
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we benefit from the fact that </v>

847
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to live together without</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to kill each other?</v>

848
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Which is the standard human problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

849
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:11.214
<v Speaker 1>Because it's good to cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want the foreigners upset </v>

850
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

851
00:45:14.841 --> 00:45:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a horse cart and,</v>

852
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing into chaos.</v>

853
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:22.314
<v Speaker 1>So how do you balance that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you could imagine Eliana called </v>

854
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:25.974
<v Speaker 1>this the war of the Gods in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very common mythological </v>

855
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 1>motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>

856
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:31.164
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these tribes have their own culture </v>

857
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and their own representation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

858
00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Often in mythological stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're brought together.</v>

859
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Where does the war take place?</v>

860
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't take place between the </v>

861
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.433
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what will happen if they can't </v>

862
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:49.064
<v Speaker 1>cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take place between the </v>

863
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening is,</v>

864
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has got a story and culture be </v>

865
00:45:55.661 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 1>he's got a story and the story's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the same and they're kind of not the</v>

866
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

867
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>well then everybody thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

868
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you've got your God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've got mine.</v>

869
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

870
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

871
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 1>who are we going to pay any attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

872
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

873
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>just kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be the end of the problem.</v>

874
00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Speaker 1>My God wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or another issue would be,</v>

875
00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:15.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just let everything drop into </v>

876
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:16.944
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in some sense I think is what </v>

877
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:18.894
<v Speaker 1>happened to Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just ate so many gods can no longer </v>

878
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:21.744
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we're going to figure out how to get </v>

879
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 1>along together.</v>

880
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Well that means your story in my story </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be brought together.</v>

881
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:31.560
<v Speaker 1>So they're commensurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

882
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:36.561
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is that you can actually see</v>

883
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 1>this happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the oldest books in the Bible.</v>

884
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So the Bible is a collection of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

885
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.773
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of books that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of Bible like that didn't get into </v>

886
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:53.361
<v Speaker 1>the final version when people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing about which should be in an inch</v>

887
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.383
<v Speaker 1>in what order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the books were written and there's </v>

888
00:46:56.581 --> 00:46:57.414
<v Speaker 1>huge arguments about what should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>included and what shouldn't and what </v>

889
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:00.204
<v Speaker 1>sequence they should be included in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these arguments went over thousands </v>

890
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that major legal arguments.</v>

891
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you go into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into genesis for example,</v>

892
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and you look at the story of Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eve,</v>

893
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:11.603
<v Speaker 1>what you find is it's not one story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at least two and maybe three and </v>

894
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:17.903
<v Speaker 1>that's been identified through </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycholinguistic analysis and also </v>

895
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 1>through anthropological investigation.</v>

896
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.363
<v Speaker 1>And so there's version one and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>version two and then the guy they call </v>

897
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 1>the redactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a hypothetical character,</v>

898
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>organize these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut them apart and sequenced them,</v>

899
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 1>tried to keep both in some order that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made sense.</v>

900
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:38.614
<v Speaker 1>And so what he was basically doing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking two traditions whose stories had </v>

901
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 1>some archetipal similarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who's,</v>

902
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.153
<v Speaker 1>who's details deferred and he's trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them logically coherent so they </v>

903
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 1>can fit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

904
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he doing that?</v>

905
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is we either get our stories </v>

906
00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 1>together or you're a slave and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant,</v>

907
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>or the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we kill each other.</v>

908
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

909
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 1>apart from pure descend into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

910
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to do either of us any good </v>

911
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:05.824
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a nihilism and it's a </v>

912
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 1>real threat to human societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

913
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So the war between the Gods in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavens is something like this.</v>

914
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like the top left hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation is too simple.</v>

915
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 1>We know that because when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something it isn't.</v>

916
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 1>When you're going from point a to point </v>
<v Speaker 1>B and you act that out because sometimes</v>

917
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you're working at a much more abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

918
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.183
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to do well at </v>

919
00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:32.704
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how do you move your body to </v>

920
00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:40.300
<v Speaker 1>accomplish that will now answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong level of resolution.</v>

921
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:41.134
<v Speaker 1>To answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go trying to do well in </v>

922
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

923
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 1>How do you subdivide that?</v>

924
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I take five classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

925
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:50.683
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you got subdivided down to five </v>

926
00:48:52.101 --> 00:48:55.160
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do the readings in each class.</v>

927
00:48:55.161 --> 00:48:57.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's getting closer to behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

928
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.963
<v Speaker 1>How do you do the readings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I opened the book and I moved my </v>

929
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:01.971
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

930
00:49:01.971 --> 00:49:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So then you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're down to a high,</v>

931
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.530
<v Speaker 1>low resolution level of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of Representation.</v>

932
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.520
<v Speaker 1>But so when you look at the thing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top left,</v>

933
00:49:10.521 --> 00:49:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it's really more like the thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

934
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.933
<v Speaker 1>It's nested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nested value orientations that </v>

935
00:49:18.441 --> 00:49:21.890
<v Speaker 1>ground out in action and how those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be nested.</v>

936
00:49:21.891 --> 00:49:22.724
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's either war discussion that that </v>

937
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.060
<v Speaker 1>determines that war thought or </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

938
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.500
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got,</v>

939
00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:34.280
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't do it with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>two thought and discussion,</v>

940
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:35.833
<v Speaker 1>the only recourse you have is war or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degeneration indicates which will </v>

941
00:49:40.881 --> 00:49:41.714
<v Speaker 1>produce war anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and then there's a further </v>

942
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:45.464
<v Speaker 1>transformation is which is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could do any of these three things </v>

943
00:49:51.231 --> 00:49:55.980
<v Speaker 1>to further my move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which takes priority.</v>

944
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.023
<v Speaker 1>Now you're solving that problem all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or you can't act and sometimes </v>

945
00:50:00.241 --> 00:50:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually see this in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know sometimes,</v>

946
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.833
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

947
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.693
<v Speaker 1>if you're driving somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not sure whether you're going to </v>

948
00:50:07.021 --> 00:50:08.760
<v Speaker 1>go straight or go left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of go,</v>

949
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you flip between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know in confusion.</v>

950
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna go anywhere.</v>

951
00:50:13.441 --> 00:50:14.274
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make one more important the </v>

952
00:50:16.171 --> 00:50:17.004
<v Speaker 1>other than before you can act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever you're undertaking any </v>

953
00:50:19.801 --> 00:50:20.634
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is organize the whole </v>

954
00:50:22.321 --> 00:50:23.154
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of values so that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions at the level you're </v>

955
00:50:25.471 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 1>operating or you're frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're making value judgments all</v>

956
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:29.630
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

957
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:30.464
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you go to the library or should </v>

958
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 1>you read your book at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you shouldn't you be studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that course or this course,</v>

960
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you're really feeling desperate,</v>

961
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.053
<v Speaker 1>should you be in that discipline or </v>
<v Speaker 1>should you be in university or should </v>

962
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

963
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's when you should visit very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seldomly.</v>

964
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want the local problem to,</v>

965
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.940
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

966
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 1>to dominate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

967
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

968
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:55.623
<v Speaker 1>if things have got very disorganized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go all the way to the </v>

969
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:57.891
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

970
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard on people to do that.</v>

971
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So societies have to get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>priorities straight,</v>

972
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 1>which is their value hierarchies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals do to.</v>

973
00:51:07.671 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're looking at how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens over the historical timespan,</v>

974
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So battle of gods of the gods and habit,</v>

975
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what happens.</v>

976
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:21.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

977
00:51:21.251 --> 00:51:22.084
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

978
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.170
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

979
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.073
<v Speaker 1>if there is a transpersonal space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the imagination in which these </v>

980
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 1>longterm discussions in battles take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

981
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to represent that somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human would think about that at least</v>

982
00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>in part is the collective unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the collective unconscious is.</v>

983
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:45.403
<v Speaker 1>Here's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collective unconscious is all those </v>

984
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.250
<v Speaker 1>behavioral patterns and presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we share.</v>

985
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 1>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

986
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:55.960
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

987
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a full account of that.</v>

988
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

989
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:02.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are different representations </v>

990
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:06.650
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the one on the left,</v>

991
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.693
<v Speaker 1>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another representation of what </v>

992
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:11.560
<v Speaker 1>constitutes authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

993
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.453
<v Speaker 1>there's God the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these kind of got a little </v>

994
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:15.560
<v Speaker 1>pyramid hat on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite cool.</v>

995
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think helps explain why the damn Egypt</v>

996
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.350
<v Speaker 1>shins were so obsessed with pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

997
00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

998
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a hierarchical structure up here at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mit.</v>

999
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And they thought about that as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred.</v>

1000
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And there is something sacred about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical structure.</v>

1001
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 1>The question is what's the structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should it be structured?</v>

1002
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.213
<v Speaker 1>So there's God with his little pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 1>hat and then in front of them he's got </v>

1003
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 1>across and I think that's in an orb that</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the world.</v>

1004
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.713
<v Speaker 1>And then in front of that there's a dove</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dove is the third part of the </v>

1005
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Christian Trinity and the dove </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the Holy Spirit.</v>

1006
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:49.064
<v Speaker 1>And the Holy Spirit hypothetically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about it as the action </v>

1007
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>of conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1008
00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the manifestation of tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to date tradition in you.</v>

1009
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.063
<v Speaker 1>So there's a personal element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and that's why the dove is a thing </v>

1010
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that communicates between the heavenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>realms and the earthly realm.</v>

1011
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1012
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that on the American dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill,</v>

1013
00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:17.390
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool because what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done there,</v>

1014
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.940
<v Speaker 1>same kind of idea except the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid is detached from the bottom,</v>

1015
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.863
<v Speaker 1>which I really love because what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making this claim that the thing </v>

1016
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:30.540
<v Speaker 1>that's at the top of the pyramid isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the pyramid.</v>

1017
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's bloody brilliant and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's an observation.</v>

1018
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.050
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God right,</v>

1019
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to tell that story here </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a minute.</v>

1020
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:38.783
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>

1021
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go back to the game idea.</v>

1022
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Your kids playing hockey and you say,</v>

1023
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:54.860
<v Speaker 1>be a good sport now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question would be,</v>

1024
00:53:54.861 --> 00:53:57.410
<v Speaker 1>if the pyramid at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the hockey game,</v>

1025
00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.413
<v Speaker 1>if he's a good sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean he's going to win the </v>

1026
00:54:00.981 --> 00:54:03.470
<v Speaker 1>hockey game and answer that is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that.</v>

1027
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:04.723
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that he's going to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game that goes across multiple sets </v>

1028
00:54:08.931 --> 00:54:10.970
<v Speaker 1>of games across very large spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1029
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not really part of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1030
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's above them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the best game to play.</v>

1031
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:21.320
<v Speaker 1>So at least that's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1032
00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:23.480
<v Speaker 1>even in that representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an eye,</v>

1033
00:54:23.481 --> 00:54:25.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>

1034
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Washington monument at the top of it</v>

1035
00:54:28.821 --> 00:54:29.950
<v Speaker 1>has a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>and there's a cap on that pyramid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cap is made out of aluminum.</v>

1037
00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:35.143
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would it be made out of </v>

1038
00:54:36.021 --> 00:54:36.500
<v Speaker 1>aluminum?</v>

1039
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was when that monument </v>
<v Speaker 1>was made,</v>

1040
00:54:38.991 --> 00:54:39.824
<v Speaker 1>aluminum was the most precious metal on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet because people had just </v>

1041
00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:45.590
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they made this nice cap that was even</v>

1042
00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:47.890
<v Speaker 1>more precious than gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what this,</v>

1043
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:48.763
<v Speaker 1>what the symbol is that the thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the pyramid that isn't </v>

1044
00:54:51.711 --> 00:54:53.960
<v Speaker 1>quite connected to it is more precious </v>
<v Speaker 1>than gold.</v>

1045
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's an l chemical idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's right.</v>

1046
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a metaphor or it is,</v>

1047
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:04.901
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of things we think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphors aren't,</v>

1048
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:08.990
<v Speaker 1>they're just descriptions of things at </v>
<v Speaker 1>our level we don't understand.</v>

1049
00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:09.853
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1050
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.353
<v Speaker 3>Sacred</v>

1051
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.400
<v Speaker 1>cause it keeps chaos in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Properly balanced everywhere.</v>

1052
00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And we'll get into that more deeply as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get into these stories.</v>

1053
00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1054
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.720
<v Speaker 1>town so that you sort of have to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1055
00:55:31.721 --> 00:55:32.554
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes sacred and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I would say is the more </v>

1056
00:55:36.011 --> 00:55:39.130
<v Speaker 1>unshakable a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sacred it is.</v>

1057
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1058
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.660
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if one truth is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>unshakable than another?</v>

1059
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1060
00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:45.574
<v Speaker 1>you got to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm presenting as far as I </v>

1061
00:55:48.131 --> 00:55:53.131
<v Speaker 1>can tell is how people have figured that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out over God only knows what's what span</v>

1062
00:55:53.801 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's 100,</v>

1063
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.013
<v Speaker 1>it's 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years for sure of actually trying to </v>

1064
00:56:00.761 --> 00:56:01.594
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the dominance hierarchies </v>

1065
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.840
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1066
00:56:04.841 --> 00:56:08.290
<v Speaker 1>those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know there are 400 million years old.</v>

1067
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.080
<v Speaker 1>So we've been working at this for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

1068
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:12.603
<v Speaker 1>So now I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one of the things that sacred </v>

1069
00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:16.953
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is how you keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in tact and transforming because </v>

1070
00:56:22.061 --> 00:56:22.894
<v Speaker 1>if it's intact and it just falls apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their environment around it </v>

1071
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1072
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell good is that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>play the same game forever,</v>

1073
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but you have to play a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>

1074
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1075
00:56:35.241 --> 00:56:36.074
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm going to tell you the </v>

1076
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what time is it?</v>

1077
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:43.563
<v Speaker 1>This is a good time for break and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come you come back and I'll tell </v>

1078
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you this Egyptian story and it's a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
