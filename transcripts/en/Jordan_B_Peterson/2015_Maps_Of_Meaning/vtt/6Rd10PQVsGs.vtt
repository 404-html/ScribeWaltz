1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.613
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person who visited me during the </v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>break had a question that was a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but all the other questions weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

4
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>But this one is a question of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>general relevance.</v>

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So do you want to repeat your question?</v>

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 2>People having but then dose those </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

7
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.993
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a really good question.</v>

9
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:37.894
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said God is dead and he believed </v>

10
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that things would fall apart as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And I'm claiming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

12
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>that people have an implicit religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and they act it out.</v>

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a lot of things </v>

14
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:55.381
<v Speaker 1>happened as a consequence of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a reasonable issue.</v>

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.313
<v Speaker 1>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might think </v>

16
00:00:58.811 --> 00:00:59.644
<v Speaker 1>about is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nature is claiming Dostoyevsky's </v>

17
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:05.524
<v Speaker 1>claim were quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that once you took the </v>

18
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>foundation out of something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would fall out.</v>

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It might take a long time to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a big thing.</v>

20
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.971
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you could make the claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

22
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:22.351
<v Speaker 1>that the Soviet Union basically fell in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1970 but it took 19 years to topple</v>

23
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>over because it's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't crumble all at once.</v>

25
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.513
<v Speaker 1>And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be once you hack out the basic </v>

26
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:31.984
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and question them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's only a matter of time until </v>

27
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.811
<v Speaker 1>the entire structure decays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could think that perhaps,</v>

28
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a habit and then you become </v>

29
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>conscious of the habit and you practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>a new habit,</v>

30
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.314
<v Speaker 1>then you can have a new habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that you can </v>

31
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>use your conscious mind to restructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>your implicit beliefs.</v>

32
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:53.284
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can use your conscious mind to </v>

33
00:01:55.121 --> 00:02:00.121
<v Speaker 1>destroy your belief in the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those implicit actions and demolish them</v>

34
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.024
<v Speaker 1>So that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think to some degree that has </v>

36
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.364
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly happened enough so that </v>

37
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>people are very confused about what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe or even about what belief means.</v>

38
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a contradiction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people think and there's a and how </v>

39
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>they act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to speak.</v>

43
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.393
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he actually took that question very </v>

44
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>seriously in some sense because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

45
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>here's the floor niches argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>

46
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I hesitate to ever say that because like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

47
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>he was a staggering genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

48
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
<v Speaker 1>but nature believed his proposition was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that once the religious edifice fell </v>

49
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that people would have to create their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own value.</v>

50
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.504
<v Speaker 1>So he believed that the over ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superman so to speak would be a new </v>

51
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.363
<v Speaker 1>type of human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an existential type of human being </v>

52
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>who would be able to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no ultimate meaning,</v>

53
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>but create their own values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>What the weird thing about that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't actually seem to create values.</v>

55
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where is flawed.</v>

56
00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.084
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where he implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted the presuppositions of the </v>

57
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.444
<v Speaker 1>rationalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if there's no real source of </v>

58
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it stands to reason that you create</v>

59
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>

60
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>not easily like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>think about your own life.</v>

62
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.753
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you make a new year's </v>

63
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.101
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

64
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.934
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study like three hours a </v>

65
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.454
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trying to create your </v>

66
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>own value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.993
<v Speaker 1>But then you find out it's a lot harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you think because you don't listen </v>

68
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you wonder off and you know,</v>

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>play video games or watch something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

70
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

71
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing that?</v>

72
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're led by values.</v>

73
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't create them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe there's a cocreation,</v>

74
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not like you can't change </v>

75
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.014
<v Speaker 1>yourself at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we should be very careful before we </v>

76
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:55.834
<v Speaker 1>jumped to the conclusion that values are</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even can be something that people </v>

77
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.624
<v Speaker 1>actually create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomenologists like heidegger </v>

78
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>and young well would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

79
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

80
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:14.521
<v Speaker 1>let's just not get too hasty about </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the presupposition that we can or</v>

81
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>should create her own values.</v>

82
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.933
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason you might be hesitant to do </v>

83
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>that is that Hitler created is value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

84
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>And so did the Soviet communists and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Koreans.</v>

85
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:29.374
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to impose a rationalist </v>

86
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>value structure on a society and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that,</v>

87
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:37.294
<v Speaker 1>people debate about how many people died</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union as a consequence of </v>

89
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.704
<v Speaker 1>internal repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as the Marxist revisionists rally </v>

90
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>back to the original beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the estimate keeps going down.</v>

91
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was tens of millions of people.</v>

92
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in China,</v>

93
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was maybe it was 100 million people,</v>

94
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's the Nazis it,</v>

95
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

96
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.883
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the act of attempting to rationally </v>

97
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>constructed value system and then impose</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that it doesn't seem to work out very</v>

98
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

99
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a sociological level,</v>

100
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>we seem to have evidence that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

101
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And then on a personal level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

102
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so sure you create your values.</v>

103
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say to a large degree you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered them.</v>

104
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.553
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

106
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>here's an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can try one,</v>

107
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I told you last week I think to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch yourself speak for,</v>

108
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you should do it for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

109
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because words are very,</v>

110
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful and they lead you places.</v>

111
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>So you should be careful how you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

112
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:46.924
<v Speaker 1>But like here's another really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting experiment is watch what </v>

113
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try,</v>

114
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>don't try to control it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just see where it is.</v>

115
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:55.594
<v Speaker 1>Because like in the phenomenologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly made much of this is like for </v>

116
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for Heidegger,</v>

117
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.883
<v Speaker 1>value is something that manifested </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the world and attracted your </v>

118
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't something you precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

120
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Now I believe you have a hand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating it.</v>

121
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk more about that later because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

122
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not a deterministic entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

123
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you can participate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of a value system,</v>

124
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take your biological nature </v>

125
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:25.904
<v Speaker 1>into mind and you have to take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural nature into mind and you'll </v>

126
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>have to take other people into mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

127
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can vary the game,</v>

128
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you can really change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>

129
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

130
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Now what you did in many ways was he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

131
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:43.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we have to go back down into the </v>

132
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.364
<v Speaker 1>deep symbolic substrata of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche to find the origin place of the </v>

133
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we used to hold as religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a hypothesis in some sense,</v>

134
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.494
<v Speaker 1>and so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalytic hypothesis is </v>

135
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

136
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.713
<v Speaker 1>it's the psychic substrata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre linguistic psychic substrata </v>

137
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>that is the source of ritual symbol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas.</v>

138
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.393
<v Speaker 1>And so that you can go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source in a sense to revitalize those </v>

139
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:18.194
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that strikes me as a wiser approach </v>

140
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.114
<v Speaker 1>than the rational approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which says you can just create your </v>

141
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we tried that.</v>

142
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really didn't work.</v>

143
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It was murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

144
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative,</v>

145
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>the no value proposition as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be nihilistic.</v>

146
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:38.834
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think nihilism is a form of mental </v>

147
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sociological,</v>

148
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>it it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's caused by sociological conditions,</v>

149
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally it's a mental illness,</v>

150
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.033
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

151
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.013
<v Speaker 1>You revise what you mean by believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it and that's what we're </v>

152
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:03.660
<v Speaker 1>going to try to walk through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a linear argument in some sense,</v>

154
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:07.830
<v Speaker 1>although there's going to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangents.</v>

155
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:08.664
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you how that might be </v>

156
00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:16.020
<v Speaker 1>done and what it might mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

157
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>who knows what it ultimately means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

158
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:18.594
<v Speaker 1>There's just no going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my experience with these ideas have </v>

159
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:22.734
<v Speaker 1>been that once you understand them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different way of categorizing </v>

160
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say all sorts of things that you</v>

161
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand all of a sudden light </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for you.</v>

162
00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's really helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:35.094
<v Speaker 1>because for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just give you a couple of </v>

164
00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:37.680
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:38.514
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's a unspoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition of much of today's </v>

166
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.893
<v Speaker 1>sociobiological thinking that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something pathological about human </v>

167
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.114
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

168
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.983
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've heard people say like human </v>

169
00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:53.694
<v Speaker 1>beings are like a cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I went to a talk at Ted talk </v>

170
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:58.014
<v Speaker 1>at Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Tedx talk where one of the professors </v>

171
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>who was a radical environmentalist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts,</v>

172
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told the whole audience,</v>

173
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they were all people about your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they had any ounce of ethical,</v>

174
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>if they had any ethical standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

175
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

176
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really he said,</v>

177
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.084
<v Speaker 1>well we've only had one child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me I thought that was one child </v>

178
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>too many for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

179
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.024
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's bloody pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you stand up in front of a whole </v>

180
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.294
<v Speaker 1>bunch of young people who have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole future in front of them and you </v>

181
00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:32.401
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

182
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're such a horrid creature in your </v>

183
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>very core that it would be a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>violation for you to propagate.</v>

184
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Its like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.063
<v Speaker 1>so I mean one of the things that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to me is like I kind of like </v>

186
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.590
<v Speaker 1>there are peculiar and weird like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippopotamuses and,</v>

188
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and rhinos and penguins and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

189
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't think that we're some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of cancer on the planet.</v>

190
00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:58.794
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pre genocidal idea as far as </v>

191
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the planet would be better off</v>

192
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>without any people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

193
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:06.954
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad you're not near the old thermo </v>

194
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>nuclear button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

195
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

196
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's an archetypal idea.</v>

197
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Fire will cleanse everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

198
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:18.564
<v Speaker 1>that's what Hitler believed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why all Berlin was burning when </v>

199
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:21.864
<v Speaker 1>he committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that was what he was after </v>

200
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cleansing fire.</v>

201
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like beware of those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

202
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

203
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.223
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the intrinsic dignity of </v>

204
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.554
<v Speaker 1>people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their intrinsic value and how that </v>

205
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 1>can be expressed across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

206
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>and I value that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

207
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:40.741
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

208
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it's something pristine and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and remarkable,</v>

209
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.081
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

210
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 1>and understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that understanding these ideas</v>

211
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 1>property can give you that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation,</v>

212
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.881
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody's flawed and useless and half </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

214
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

215
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly the point.</v>

216
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>There are reasons we are flawed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless and half crazy.</v>

217
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is hard and we're finite and we </v>

218
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:03.923
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have big problems that confront </v>

219
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:05.754
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

220
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any sane person cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy so to speak.</v>

221
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.613
<v Speaker 1>But having said all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there's something </v>

222
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically pathological about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings like that is an absolutely,</v>

223
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apocalyptic idea.</v>

224
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like beware of people who tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>such things,</v>

225
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly not something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be thinking about yourself.</v>

227
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who knows what you're up to.</v>

228
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of you will be great people,</v>

229
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck with it.</v>

230
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.723
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to walk you through what I </v>

231
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.494
<v Speaker 1>think these ideas mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not asking you to believe </v>

232
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>anything I tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't hack away at it,</v>

233
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can see where it's flawed.</v>

234
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried.</v>

235
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So cause I don't want to be standing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>

236
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.403
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've tried to do is to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at human history and prehistory and to </v>

237
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>see what it is that we need to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

238
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>And we have to be united with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

239
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:09.784
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are historical creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's a divide between us </v>

240
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.534
<v Speaker 1>and our history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all sorts of weird ideas are going </v>

241
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:16.120
<v Speaker 1>to invade us.</v>

242
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.433
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

243
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.320
<v Speaker 1>it's quite funny because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the rationalists atheists,</v>

244
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically think that if we dispense</v>

245
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:22.894
<v Speaker 1>with religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would turn into Rene </v>

246
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Descartes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

247
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like we'd be all rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

248
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>are you out of your bloody mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the new age people,</v>

249
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we'd be going first.</v>

250
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shirley,</v>

251
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>what's your name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mclean who I read once believed that the</v>

252
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 1>reason that there were so many allergies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco was because of aliens.</v>

253
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

254
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more likely place for </v>
<v Speaker 1>human belief systems to end up.</v>

255
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

256
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>we're all rene decartes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

257
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

258
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I just loved,</v>

259
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:57.244
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of religious structures is </v>

260
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 1>to stop people from having religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

261
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's smart saying.</v>

262
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to walk through this and,</v>

263
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I,</v>

264
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.280
<v Speaker 1>what I've come to believe is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes we're going to talk about,</v>

265
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.123
<v Speaker 1>because I believe they archetypes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good way of thinking about them </v>

266
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>constitute the fundamental presumptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human being.</v>

267
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't not presume them.</v>

268
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why the religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't escape from them.</v>

269
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.763
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that there as right as we </v>

270
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how right are we?</v>

271
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

272
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:39.214
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were people that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's in the 1970s he was a </v>

273
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:44.014
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book called the ghost in the </v>

274
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

275
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a fairly common proposition</v>

276
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His idea was that,</v>

277
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 1>we're animals that have become self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and that may be strictly drove</v>

279
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>us incurably insane.</v>

280
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.913
<v Speaker 1>And so we're like an evolutionary dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>end and it's only a matter of time </v>

281
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>before we extinguish ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's possible.</v>

282
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.943
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other animal has ever become self </v>

283
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big burden,</v>

284
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does drive people kind of crazy </v>

285
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.484
<v Speaker 1>cause you have to contemplate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality all the time or at least some </v>

287
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.814
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you're completely aware of how </v>

288
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:18.484
<v Speaker 1>useless and ugly and you know all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things you are compared to </v>

289
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever the ideal might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of burden.</v>

290
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.623
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me to that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are peculiar in that we can actually </v>

291
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have some facility for choice.</v>

292
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I think we could decide whether we're an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary dead end or not.</v>

293
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:39.030
<v Speaker 1>And I also believe that grounding our </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in these ancient ideas makes it</v>

294
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>far more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far less likely that we're going to fall</v>

295
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>prey to ideological possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinary dangerous.</v>

296
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.473
<v Speaker 1>And it'll also give us the metta </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework to conceptualize what might </v>

297
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>constitute ideal and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

298
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:54.734
<v Speaker 1>that's cause I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find out what's an </v>

299
00:14:56.451 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 1>alternative cause videology and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the wrong answer because people can't</v>

300
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 1>live on nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is too hard.</v>

301
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to see that your being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifiable in order to thrive.</v>

302
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.560
<v Speaker 1>And given that your being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by suffering,</v>

303
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>that's no easy matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and limitation.</v>

304
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.214
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic truths of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Buddhist doctrine for that </v>

305
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:19.634
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

306
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

307
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not something that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews would disagree with.</v>

308
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's central to Christian thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

309
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most religious structures thing,</v>

310
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you're doomed and there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of pain along the way.</v>

311
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

312
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

313
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:40.630
<v Speaker 1>now we've got that out in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do about it?</v>

314
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

315
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.650
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see,</v>

316
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.300
<v Speaker 1>what do we have for time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's three 45 is that about right?</v>

317
00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:52.950
<v Speaker 1>This old computer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it's accurate.</v>

318
00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

319
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.413
<v Speaker 1>so question.</v>

320
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess now that we've conceptualized it</v>

321
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:01.390
<v Speaker 2>as a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

322
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is,</v>

323
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes conceptualizing a problem </v>

324
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.703
<v Speaker 1>brings it into focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are multiple ways things realize </v>

325
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:09.734
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is.</v>

327
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:12.710
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn something complex,</v>

328
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:13.544
<v Speaker 1>you think you've learned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a little later you articulated </v>

329
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.401
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think,</v>

330
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

331
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

332
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you think you've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in three years later you think,</v>

333
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't quite have that.</v>

334
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to articulate it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So knowledge comes into focus and so,</v>

335
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's move away from,</v>

336
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>from the this philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

337
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary discussion for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it,</v>

338
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to start again with a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>

339
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:36.974
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

340
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.533
<v Speaker 2>330</v>

341
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it's three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

342
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

343
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.753
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

344
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Three 38 all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

345
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:49.961
<v Speaker 1>So now when I first started to construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>this representation,</v>

346
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.683
<v Speaker 1>I'd been reading heavily a book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychology of anxiety that's </v>

347
00:16:58.551 --> 00:16:59.384
<v Speaker 1>written by Jeffrey Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray was one of hands ising </v>

348
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:02.484
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac was one of the other founders </v>

349
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 1>of modern psychometric personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory for a long time.</v>

350
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>He was the most cited psychologist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

351
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And Jeffrey Gray was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray who died recently was a,</v>

352
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>he was a literate guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

353
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.253
<v Speaker 1>The neuropsychology of anxiety is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough read because he was sort of a </v>

354
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:25.750
<v Speaker 1>master of neuropharmacology neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomy,</v>

355
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.203
<v Speaker 1>neuro psychology and animal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a behaviorist and cybernetic </v>

356
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.334
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't really think he knew </v>

357
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 1>exactly that he was a cybernetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist.</v>

358
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.613
<v Speaker 1>He sort of knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to figure out </v>

359
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:41.954
<v Speaker 1>that he was a cybernetic theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cybernetics emerged as a consequence of </v>

360
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>the work of someone called Norbert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiener,</v>

361
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:49.244
<v Speaker 1>who was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was at mit and he wrote a book </v>

362
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.660
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wrote,</v>

363
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I think the book was called cybernetics </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

364
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look them up.</v>

365
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are cybernetic principles that</v>

366
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:02.934
<v Speaker 1>I extracted out of gray and it started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to utilize and then I only found out </v>

367
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 1>later that they were actually</v>

368
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.010
<v Speaker 1>consequences of whiners thinking now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he infected lots of people.</v>

369
00:18:12.011 --> 00:18:12.844
<v Speaker 1>So luria who was a great Russian nurse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro psychologist was basically a </v>

370
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.610
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple of other Russians,</v>

371
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Sokolov and vinegar Dova who discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the orienting reflex,</v>

372
00:18:21.911 --> 00:18:22.744
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like discovering a new planet </v>

373
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Speaker 1>or a new continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an important discovery.</v>

374
00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:28.420
<v Speaker 1>They should've got the Nobel prize for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

375
00:18:28.421 --> 00:18:30.490
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

376
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.833
<v Speaker 1>And so Norbert Wiener cybernetic thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>really spread everywhere and it like </v>

377
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.360
<v Speaker 1>pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget is cybernetic in many ways.</v>

378
00:18:37.361 --> 00:18:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's modern personality theories that</v>

379
00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:40.714
<v Speaker 1>are fundamentally cybernetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is basically a cybernetic model </v>

380
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.183
<v Speaker 1>and cybernetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic models hypothesize that </v>

381
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.523
<v Speaker 1>active organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically perform according to the </v>

382
00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:54.874
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

383
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

384
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Schema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paused at a target and move towards</v>

385
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:03.234
<v Speaker 1>it and then they regulate themselves so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't deviate too much from the </v>

386
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:08.484
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what this is as far as I'm </v>

387
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

388
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.983
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the basic framework within which </v>

389
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you live as far as I can tell and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you can get out of it.</v>

390
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And you carry this frame with you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and you're looking at the world</v>

391
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:22.374
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the framework has a couple of </v>

392
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>substructures and one is you have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of where you are.</v>

393
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a theory of where,</v>

394
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:35.400
<v Speaker 1>who you are and where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a theory of the present.</v>

395
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.443
<v Speaker 1>These are the present conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think you observe the </v>

396
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.550
<v Speaker 1>present around you and those are factual</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>

397
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And so your conceptualization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present isn't a theory.</v>

398
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't be thinking that,</v>

399
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a theory.</v>

400
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.743
<v Speaker 1>You might be wrong about the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person you're in love with might be </v>

401
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 1>having an affair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

402
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So there can be massive gaps in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions about the present.</v>

403
00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're healthy,</v>

404
00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you think your boss likes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they don't.</v>

406
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You think your degree is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

407
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

408
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

409
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just a straight forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

410
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>But it's an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be wrong about now.</v>

411
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:20.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause one of the things we're going to </v>

412
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out is where is it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be wrong and what does it mean</v>

413
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 1>that you could be wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those places.</v>

414
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And what should you do about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could be wrong?</v>

415
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.823
<v Speaker 1>All those places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're also going to try to </v>

416
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 1>figure out what happens if you find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong.</v>

417
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

418
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going out with someone you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

419
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>perhaps they've made promises to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.373
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out that they'd been having an </v>

421
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 1>affair with three people for the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

422
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

423
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now where are you?</v>

424
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean that you're wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

425
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:54.394
<v Speaker 1>it means a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're means a lot of things </v>

426
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:57.904
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might mean a lot more things that it </v>

427
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very strange thing,</v>

428
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 1>might mean that you're so clueless as is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just mind boggling,</v>

429
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:06.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you're blind as a bat.</v>

430
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.293
<v Speaker 1>So that's one possibility and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like that and you've always been </v>

431
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better do something about it quick.</v>

432
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility might be that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked up with a psychopath,</v>

433
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is also something that you should </v>

434
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:17.884
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but that would mean you don't </v>

435
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:22.390
<v Speaker 1>understand people well enough to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're psychopaths or not,</v>

436
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that your fatally attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in some bizarre way.</v>

437
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.733
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also means that whatever future you </v>

438
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 1>were envisioning that was really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion because that's gone.</v>

439
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And it also means that you've blown out </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of your past,</v>

440
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:34.864
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far as that relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>was part of your past because nothing </v>

441
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>that you thought was happening was what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening.</v>

442
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think one moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're somewhere,</v>

443
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>then you get the realization and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next moment you are somewhere else.</v>

444
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.143
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I would propose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you is that those are actually two </v>

445
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 1>important places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one place is the place you are,</v>

446
00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 1>when what you're doing is working.</v>

447
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And the other place is the place you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>when what you're doing is not working.</v>

448
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say in some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

449
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 1>those are permanent places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why I think this,</v>

450
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:14.194
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're akin in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>to explored territory and unexplored </v>

451
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.504
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's their sort of biological </v>

452
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.724
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we know that animals are </v>

453
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.140
<v Speaker 1>territorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

454
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Almost every animal has a sketched out </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

455
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if social animals have to organize </v>

456
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:30.064
<v Speaker 1>themselves within that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward territory with other creatures </v>

457
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:32.764
<v Speaker 1>like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of their territory is almost </v>

458
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 1>always a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a territory and they don't</v>

459
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 1>like going outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can,</v>

460
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

461
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.983
<v Speaker 1>my parents have that dog and a cat and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>that my dad used to take the dog for a </v>

462
00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 1>walk all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cat really liked the dog.</v>

463
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And so it was kind of irritated that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog would leave.</v>

464
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And so the cat started following my dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>around on his walks.</v>

465
00:22:55.991 --> 00:22:56.824
<v Speaker 1>And so it was really interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing the cat did was when it </v>

466
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:01.990
<v Speaker 1>was following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't right behind the dog.</v>

467
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:02.883
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it was going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would slink along all of the </v>

468
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:06.214
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would follow about 30 feet behind </v>

469
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 1>and it would keep one side right against</v>
<v Speaker 1>a building.</v>

470
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And then it would sort of zip across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervening spaces of the houses.</v>

471
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

472
00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was it doing that?</v>

473
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it didn't know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bloody predators were.</v>

474
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:21.844
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know where the big dogs were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't know anything about the new </v>

475
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:24.634
<v Speaker 1>places it was going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was going to stick inside against </v>

476
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:27.244
<v Speaker 1>one hard wall so that the complexity was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut in half and it was going to go </v>

477
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>really slow on the off chance that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive hound came out and ate it.</v>

478
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.650
<v Speaker 1>So it was being very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty cool.</v>

479
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:39.484
<v Speaker 1>So it did that for quite a while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then because nothing massive jumped out </v>

480
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:44.014
<v Speaker 1>and ate it and because it started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that territory knew where it </v>

481
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 1>could hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got a little braver and over a couple</v>

482
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>of months it got to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually follow the,</v>

483
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the dog because it had mastered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's expanded its territory and mastered</v>

484
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:01.250
<v Speaker 1>its knowledge of the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I was walking with them one day</v>

485
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and they had a route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

486
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.763
<v Speaker 1>and my dad had the dog and he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the dog a little farther than he </v>

487
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:07.784
<v Speaker 1>would normally go with the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was taking the dog across the </v>

488
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:11.144
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cat just stayed on the corner </v>

489
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:13.890
<v Speaker 1>and cried because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:14.724
<v Speaker 1>it was meowing obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was very upset because it wasn't </v>

491
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>going out into that weird new place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had no knowledge about.</v>

492
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 1>making its fear really known and animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like that,</v>

494
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about.</v>

495
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:28.904
<v Speaker 1>This blew me away when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized it was one of the things </v>

496
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.144
<v Speaker 1>that made me understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists are always asking </v>

497
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>questions backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

498
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

499
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>why do people take cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a question,</v>

500
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good question.</v>

501
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.923
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is why doesn't everybody </v>

502
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:51.770
<v Speaker 1>take cocaine all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

503
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Because we know what cocaine does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

504
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.133
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it activates the primary incentive </v>

505
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:57.914
<v Speaker 1>reward systems and almost everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is in an attempt to activate the </v>

506
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.434
<v Speaker 1>primary incentive reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this white powder and it </v>

507
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you should be,</v>

508
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>knows deepen that stuff nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

509
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you people,</v>

510
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

511
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.753
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one example of where </v>

512
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.330
<v Speaker 1>psychology is got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got it backwards.</v>

513
00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 1>We know why people take intoxicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

514
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 1>It's dead simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it reduces their anxiety,</v>

515
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:26.684
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it reduces their pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it cranks up their incentive </v>

516
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 1>reward systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

517
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 1>it hijacks the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does it biochemically,</v>

518
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 1>perfectly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example.</v>

519
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Now another example is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do animals learn fear?</v>

520
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a prime behavioral question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

521
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong question because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumes that the,</v>

522
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the standard animal is calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you presume that?</v>

523
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.123
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't we presume instead that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard animal is terrified and that </v>

524
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the animal only learns how not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified with difficulty and under very</v>

525
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 1>restricted circumstances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a much better way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

527
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And it makes a lot more sense because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals in danger,</v>

528
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>especially if it doesn't know its </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

529
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's how you teach an animal to be </v>

530
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:20.144
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a behaviorist and I am not </v>

531
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:22.364
<v Speaker 1>making fun of behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what I've learned about </v>

532
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:27.430
<v Speaker 1>psychology that's actually real has come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from behavior.</v>

533
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:29.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're rigorous scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

534
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.643
<v Speaker 1>and they learned an awful lot from </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing animal behavior that was </v>

535
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.093
<v Speaker 1>incredibly profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they laid the ground for modern </v>

536
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real stuff,</v>

537
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>not the FMRI stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

538
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

539
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:41.654
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically what you do to train an </v>

540
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 1>animal to be afraid is you take a rack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

541
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and the rats in this cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put,</v>

542
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 1>you put a little electric shock pad in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rats cage,</v>

543
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:54.354
<v Speaker 1>so maybe electrifies the bottom a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and you turn on a light and you </v>

544
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>electrify the bottom and the rat jumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the air and then you shut it off.</v>

545
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you wait a while and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing,</v>

546
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.463
<v Speaker 1>turn on the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you turn on the electric electric </v>

547
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 1>shock mechanism and the wrap jumps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and you do that 10 times.</v>

548
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And then when you turn on the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rat goes like,</v>

549
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 1>this freezes because it's learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

550
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Light equal shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that,</v>

551
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basic conditioning.</v>

552
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

553
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 1>so the rats learn to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

554
00:27:25.971 --> 00:27:27.740
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except,</v>

555
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

556
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 1>here's your experimental box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

557
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.043
<v Speaker 1>You got the electrification going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you grab your rat and you </v>

558
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 1>dropped me in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he do first?</v>

559
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 1>He freezes because he's afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's afraid.</v>

560
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you put them in the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

561
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the normal route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal rat.</v>

562
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

563
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Because things like to eat rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know they don't like light.</v>

564
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.713
<v Speaker 1>They like it dark and they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>being exposed and they don't like being </v>

565
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the new damn cage because God only knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in that cage.</v>

566
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Speaker 1>And so the a priori rat is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what is the wrap do?</v>

567
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like this for quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be really a long time.</v>

568
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:15.144
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like this and then maybe he sniffs </v>

569
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 1>cause rats mostly knows.</v>

570
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Most animals are mostly smell oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

571
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are weird because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually oriented,</v>

572
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but almost all animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all smell.</v>

573
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Their whole brains are organized around </v>
<v Speaker 1>their olfactory system.</v>

574
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 1>So it sniffs and if it can't smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

575
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:35.281
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

576
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:36.114
<v Speaker 1>they can smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's experiments indicating that </v>

577
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.963
<v Speaker 1>if you take a rat and you poison it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets sick and another rat has </v>

578
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.004
<v Speaker 1>smelled it's breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rat will not eat the poison that </v>

579
00:28:46.531 --> 00:28:47.364
<v Speaker 1>the first route eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why it's hard to get rid of </v>

580
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart and they have great senses</v>

581
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:53.154
<v Speaker 1>of smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rats checking out like is there </v>

582
00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 1>anything here that smells like something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might eat me?</v>

583
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.953
<v Speaker 1>So cats for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat doesn't ever have to meet a cap to </v>

584
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>be afraid of it's odor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>

585
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:03.534
<v Speaker 1>hate cat odor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can take rats in it like a </v>

586
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.743
<v Speaker 1>box and blow a fan over a cat so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the odor wafts into the box and let's </v>

587
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>like the rats are all like this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what a cat smells like to</v>

588
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't good.</v>

589
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rats like this,</v>

590
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.770
<v Speaker 1>then he sniffing and he's looking around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if nothing happens then he starts to</v>

591
00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>relax a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>

592
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>He still crouched down and he's still at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attended of rat.</v>

593
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts to look around a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he starts to loosen up and then</v>

594
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:34.704
<v Speaker 1>maybe he starts to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his theory is possibly it's safe </v>

595
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 1>enough here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Iraq,</v>

596
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that's careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can move and nothing painful or damaging</v>

597
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:43.924
<v Speaker 1>will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts to move and nothing </v>

598
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:46.504
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he spends a bunch of times </v>

599
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 1>sniffing around every corner of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>

600
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later he thinks</v>

601
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.750
<v Speaker 1>rats aren't going to die here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's sort of a relaxed rat.</v>

602
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And then the behavior says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now a normal rat.</v>

603
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.793
<v Speaker 1>We can teach you to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have to teach me to </v>

604
00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:05.840
<v Speaker 1>be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to be afraid.</v>

605
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.003
<v Speaker 1>I have to learn how not to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a good way of thinking about </v>

606
00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:12.164
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about the underlying </v>

607
00:30:14.511 --> 00:30:19.280
<v Speaker 1>motivational and emotional systems in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain as default on systems.</v>

608
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.450
<v Speaker 1>They're like a nuclear reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the core of a nuclear reactor.</v>

609
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

610
00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Except when other parts of your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling you just to keep it calm.</v>

611
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't need to learn to be afraid</v>

612
00:30:31.821 --> 00:30:33.470
<v Speaker 1>any more than you need to learn to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>

613
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn how to be calm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>secure.</v>

614
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you got to ask yourself,</v>

615
00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:41.384
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you calm and secure in this </v>

616
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:44.744
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the preconditions for you not </v>

617
00:30:47.271 --> 00:30:49.760
<v Speaker 1>being afraid here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll think about it.</v>

618
00:30:49.761 --> 00:30:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Why are you not afraid?</v>

619
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the floor is solid.</v>

620
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.493
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roof is probably not going to </v>

621
00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

622
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually because you could rely on </v>

623
00:31:04.221 --> 00:31:06.080
<v Speaker 1>the structural engineers who built the </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

624
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.480
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

625
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union they used to make </v>

626
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.330
<v Speaker 1>cinder block buildings out of old </v>
<v Speaker 1>radioactive waste.</v>

627
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:15.643
<v Speaker 1>And then of course they put way too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>sand in them so that if the earth went </v>

628
00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:20.000
<v Speaker 1>like this once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like collapse.</v>

629
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And so the typical Soviet couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably fearless in this room because</v>

630
00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:27.854
<v Speaker 1>the walls were radioactive and if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth moved a little bit to this whole </v>

631
00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:30.434
<v Speaker 1>thing would collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that you can </v>

632
00:31:32.121 --> 00:31:32.954
<v Speaker 1>sit in here without fear is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that regulates our construction </v>

633
00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:40.250
<v Speaker 1>enterprise is actually not very corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

634
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also we can think about that.</v>

635
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.583
<v Speaker 1>That means that one of the preconditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your relative fearlessness is your </v>

636
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:49.190
<v Speaker 1>implicit belief that the builders who </v>
<v Speaker 1>built this building can be trusted.</v>

637
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's really unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

638
00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:55.880
<v Speaker 1>if you look around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many countries are there that aren't</v>

639
00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:57.470
<v Speaker 1>corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

640
00:31:57.471 --> 00:31:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West is corrupt too.</v>

641
00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.713
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But compared to our really corrupt </v>

642
00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:03.170
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.290
<v Speaker 1>we don't even register as corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else?</v>

644
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the people around you.</v>

645
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys look a lot the same.</v>

646
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.830
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:15.800
<v Speaker 1>none of you or have painted your face in</v>
<v Speaker 1>rainbow colors and you know,</v>

648
00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:16.634
<v Speaker 1>you're not decorated with ostrich </v>
<v Speaker 1>feathers and you're not wearing some </v>

649
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:22.350
<v Speaker 1>outlandish victorian costume and none of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are stark naked.</v>

650
00:32:22.351 --> 00:32:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And most of you aren't foaming at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth than you know,</v>

651
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:26.323
<v Speaker 1>like fundamentally you're in a uniform </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some variation of the </v>

652
00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:30.650
<v Speaker 1>uniform allowed.</v>

653
00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.990
<v Speaker 1>But not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you are wearing jeans?</v>

654
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 50% of you.</v>

655
00:32:36.531 --> 00:32:37.364
<v Speaker 1>Why are you wearing jeans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so other primates think you're </v>

656
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.334
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm telling you it's a big </v>

657
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

658
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.343
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so most of you are wearing clean </v>

659
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 1>jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>

660
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>or they're cleaned enough anyways so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they're not clean,</v>

661
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:54.074
<v Speaker 1>it's not detectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another sign that you're not </v>

662
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

663
00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.533
<v Speaker 1>And so you're manifesting markers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad that you're basically a normal </v>

664
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.543
<v Speaker 1>primate and that you live in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a set of well understood implicit </v>

665
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:10.820
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that for the purposes of this set of</v>

666
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 1>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to violate them.</v>

667
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So everybody can come in here like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified primates.</v>

668
00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 1>They are the first class and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>look around.</v>

669
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:22.970
<v Speaker 1>They see the desks are all in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means order prevails here.</v>

670
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 1>The desks all facing this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a standard lecture theater.</v>

671
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what's going to happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People walk in,</v>

672
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:34.190
<v Speaker 1>they all sit properly in their tables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them don't talk.</v>

673
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.183
<v Speaker 1>There's another rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you are sitting in the same </v>

674
00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>chair that you sat in last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

675
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know pretty soon you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out which chairs years.</v>

676
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 1>And then if someone comes in here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sits in your chair,</v>

677
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think that person's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my chair.</v>

678
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.013
<v Speaker 1>And you know the reason for that is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to stabilize the </v>

679
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:50.984
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've learned that that chair is safe </v>

680
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:54.523
<v Speaker 1>and so are the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you feel kind of comfortable </v>

681
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 1>in that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of think it's your chair.</v>

682
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.253
<v Speaker 1>And so we do everything we can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure the environment so that </v>

683
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:08.450
<v Speaker 1>signals that you're safe are radiating </v>
<v Speaker 1>at you like mad.</v>

684
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.673
<v Speaker 1>And that way you can be calm enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you're a crazy </v>

685
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:13.754
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be calm enough to sit here and </v>

686
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:17.294
<v Speaker 1>not be distracted by fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems that are out of </v>

687
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:21.194
<v Speaker 1>control and maybe listen and attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like you just think about how much </v>

688
00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it,</v>

689
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.150
<v Speaker 1>how much work went into building this </v>
<v Speaker 1>room for you to sit in?</v>

690
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're being universities for</v>

691
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:35.504
<v Speaker 1>about a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a thousand year conceptual </v>

692
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 1>history of the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the preconditions.</v>

693
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:41.654
<v Speaker 1>And then we had to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make all this stuff and then people </v>

694
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 1>actually had to put it together and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all had to be socialized for like 19</v>

695
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:48.674
<v Speaker 1>years so that you could sit here </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively quietly while you're </v>

696
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 1>listening to a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

697
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:53.744
<v Speaker 1>we had to build the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university into our culture and you </v>

698
00:34:56.901 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's got to keep the lights on and</v>

699
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.890
<v Speaker 1>look at this technology that works.</v>

700
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are people out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>just slaving themselves to death to make</v>

701
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.734
<v Speaker 1>sure that this little box that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in is sufficiently predictable </v>

702
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.980
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't have to be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good for them,</v>

703
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.233
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all happening so invisibly </v>

704
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:18.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:35:18.261 --> 00:35:19.094
<v Speaker 1>you're probably irritated because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet connection doesn't work that </v>

706
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>well or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

707
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really,</v>

708
00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:25.634
<v Speaker 1>really useful to know that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that your normal state is calm </v>

709
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and well regulated is highly debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highly debatable.</v>

710
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:37.484
<v Speaker 1>I would say there was very limited pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions under which you are going to </v>

711
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:41.244
<v Speaker 1>feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say you're highly </v>

712
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:46.074
<v Speaker 1>motivated to maintain those conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're also highly motivated not to </v>

713
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 1>go somewhere where those conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't apply.</v>

714
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.013
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to do it because </v>

715
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a different kind of place.</v>

716
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.920
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that place is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The place where the rules do not apply,</v>

717
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.873
<v Speaker 1>that's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a real place that's unexplored </v>

718
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:13.401
<v Speaker 1>territory and peep you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hardwired at an instinctual level</v>

719
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 1>to deal with unexpected exposure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>

720
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 1>And you do that by going like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a startle and fear.</v>

721
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>You're frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you're a prey</v>

722
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:26.304
<v Speaker 1>animal and you have sub circuits in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are millions of years old that are </v>

723
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:37.011
<v Speaker 1>there to protect you from becoming prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be prey of other people,</v>

724
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.393
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could be prey of anything that </v>

725
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>would like to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

726
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is that it's not,</v>

727
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.200
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many large predators </v>
<v Speaker 1>around anymore.</v>

728
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.053
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's part of the human despoil nation </v>

729
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.003
<v Speaker 1>of the planet is that mostly people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like having their children eaten </v>

730
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 1>by tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

731
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

732
00:36:58.241 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not because there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us,</v>

733
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 1>it's because that's actually a rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant experience.</v>

734
00:37:02.881 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And so if you could have a tiger around </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not have one,</v>

735
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you might well choose not to have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have some,</v>

736
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of love for your children</v>

737
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.233
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although lovable also happened to be </v>

738
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

739
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

740
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.993
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a proposition I want to </v>

741
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 1>undermine because I want to start with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presupposition that fundamentally as</v>

742
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:24.864
<v Speaker 1>a biological creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like a wild animal and you're </v>

743
00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

744
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

745
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.583
<v Speaker 1>a prey animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things might happen to you and you're </v>

746
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>ready for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what we do with societies,</v>

747
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:35.870
<v Speaker 1>we construct up an edifice that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>multilevel,</v>

748
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 1>some of it's actually instantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

749
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.473
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of it is cultural and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual and behavioral so that you don't </v>

750
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:43.734
<v Speaker 1>have to be a prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be relatively calm and assured </v>

751
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:52.230
<v Speaker 1>that nothing terrible is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you in the next 10 seconds and that's</v>

752
00:37:52.231 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 1>worth fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

753
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably good enough.</v>

754
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.063
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got some basic presuppositions </v>

755
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 1>lead down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and so let me just review them briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One minute.</v>

757
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Stability is not your normal state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an abnormal state and it's very,</v>

758
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to maintain.</v>

759
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.943
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

760
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.630
<v Speaker 1>You maintain it at least in large part </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of being inculturated.</v>

761
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.170
<v Speaker 1>And to be enculturated means to adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>value system that works for you,</v>

762
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but that also works for everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to fulfill those criteria.</v>

763
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.443
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore should be the kind of value </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that allows you to move up </v>

764
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies if you can manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

765
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of constraints on your value </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

766
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.173
<v Speaker 1>If your value system is producing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of behaviors that fulfill those </v>

767
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 1>criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be terrified.</v>

768
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just terror.</v>

769
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:52.564
<v Speaker 1>Cause I've also learned that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what culture is controlling is </v>

770
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:55.774
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's actually not in the book </v>

771
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:59.100
<v Speaker 1>because I just learned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

772
00:38:59.101 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and I want to talk more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you more about disgust</v>

773
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:03.184
<v Speaker 1>because we've learned for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who are orderly </v>

774
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.353
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an element of </v>

775
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very sensitive to discussed.</v>

776
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the issue is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't only that things can eat us,</v>

777
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it's the things can infect us.</v>

778
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:19.893
<v Speaker 1>And so we're just as prone a Priori to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repel anything that's disgusting as we </v>

779
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>are prepared a priority to keep at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's frightening.</v>

780
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned,</v>

781
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which was terrifying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read Hitler's table talk,</v>

782
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:37.834
<v Speaker 1>which was a collection of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous dinner speeches that were </v>

783
00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 1>taken down by a secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting book.</v>

784
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.313
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things I realized once we</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of made the disgust orderliness </v>

785
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 1>connection in my lab about two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

786
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>after looking for the biological basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of conscientiousness forever,</v>

787
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.373
<v Speaker 1>Hitler basically used a bodily metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to under pin his entire political </v>

788
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:03.484
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Hitler who was hyper orderly </v>

789
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:06.304
<v Speaker 1>bordering on obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he bathed four times a day for </v>

790
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a vegetarian,</v>

791
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 1>which actually is relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

792
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't want animals to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

793
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sensitive to discussed and that </v>

794
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 1>was part of what underlying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarianism.</v>

795
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he construed the area in race as a body.</v>

796
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that was his metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a body,</v>

797
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a pure body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has pure blood.</v>

798
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's purity ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

799
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made part of what he was saying </v>

800
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:35.314
<v Speaker 1>motivationally significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was under assault from parasites </v>

801
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.923
<v Speaker 1>and the parasites were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for him it was anyone who wasn't </v>

802
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:46.060
<v Speaker 1>part of that body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was discussed,</v>

803
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 1>gone mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really was,</v>

804
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:49.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that forced me to modify my </v>

805
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theories I'm going to present to you</v>

806
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 1>because for me a lot of what society did</v>
<v Speaker 1>was control anxiety,</v>

807
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hunger and a lot of other things </v>

808
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:00.903
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't realize to what degree </v>

809
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 1>society also controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed and how powerful disgust is as</v>

810
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:09.154
<v Speaker 1>a political motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a paper published in Kloss </v>

811
00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 1>one about three months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five months ago,</v>

812
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe more than that now.</v>

813
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.263
<v Speaker 1>It showed that the correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian beliefs in any given </v>

814
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:25.621
<v Speaker 1>geographical locale and the prevalence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of infectious disease was about 0.7</v>

815
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and that was true not only across </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries but within countries.</v>

816
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:31.714
<v Speaker 1>If you divided the places up by how </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were to be infectious diseases in </v>

817
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the relevant states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.7</v>

818
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 1>so prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia,</v>

819
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.383
<v Speaker 1>fear of foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that huge chunk of that is </v>

820
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensitivity Gone Mad.</v>

821
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to talk about that too as</v>

822
00:41:53.131 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 1>a part of a control mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

823
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Applause.</v>

824
00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:02.630
<v Speaker 1>One P l o s one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a public journal.</v>

825
00:42:02.631 --> 00:42:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up infectious disease.</v>

826
00:42:04.891 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And a totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a lot of work done on that.</v>

827
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:09.974
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
