00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to maps of meaning.</v>

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a story to begin </v>

3
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.384
<v Speaker 1>with and then we'll take a break and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the break then I'll give you more </v>

4
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.961
<v Speaker 1>details about the class structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know more about the class</v>

5
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:21.924
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is go look at the </v>

6
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>syllabus online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you type my name into Google,</v>

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll get my website and then all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses are listed there.</v>

8
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:32.274
<v Speaker 1>And then you just go to the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>website and it tells you everything you </v>

9
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.514
<v Speaker 1>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you just a brief overview for </v>

10
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.733
<v Speaker 1>there's a main textbook which I presume </v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have already purchased and </v>

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's available at the bookstore.</v>

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.023
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some adjunct readings </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are listed on the website that are </v>

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers that serve as </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate additional background </v>

15
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.124
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly concentrating on neuroscience </v>

16
00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.034
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the readings and the order</v>

18
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>of the readings is also laid out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of assignments,</v>

20
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>there are three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>three and a half in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first one is,</v>

22
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.554
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've developed some writing exercises </v>

23
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years for students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>they're on a website right now called </v>
<v Speaker 1>self authoring.com</v>

25
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:24.324
<v Speaker 1>which you don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have access to the programs </v>

26
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>through this course website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about the two writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal writing essays first.</v>

28
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of evidence that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>accrued over the last 15 or 20 years.</v>

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.773
<v Speaker 1>Some of it stemming from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic tradition that writing </v>

30
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>about your life fundamentally has </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary benefits.</v>

31
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I would say some of them are health </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits because it,</v>

32
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that,</v>

33
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we'll cover to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great degree in this course,</v>

34
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>it seems that if there are elements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your past that you haven't dealt with or</v>

35
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>areas of uncertainty in your current </v>
<v Speaker 1>life or in your future considerations,</v>

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>then you bury heavy stress load because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

37
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.273
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body really doesn't like </v>

38
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oddly enough,</v>

39
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>there can be uncertainty still in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

40
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.554
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things have happened to you that you </v>

41
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

42
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.823
<v Speaker 1>your body and your brains seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to that as if it's an area of </v>

43
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.304
<v Speaker 1>dangerous territory that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that has the potential in some </v>

44
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>sense to haunt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that your body seems</v>

45
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>to respond to that is by producing high </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of stress hormones like cortisol.</v>

46
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.543
<v Speaker 1>And the reason your body does that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the more dangerous you're </v>

47
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:48.654
<v Speaker 1>environment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you should be prepared to act </v>

48
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.444
<v Speaker 1>rapidly at any given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine except that it's costly </v>

49
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>from a psychophysiological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.823
<v Speaker 1>it's demanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's physiologically demanding in what </v>

51
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.314
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that over any reasonable span of </v>

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually hurts you.</v>

53
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So writing about your past,</v>

54
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.684
<v Speaker 1>especially about things that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat difficult and hard to </v>

55
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.094
<v Speaker 1>understand seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it seems to lower the degree to </v>

56
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:25.290
<v Speaker 1>which you're haunted by uncertainty and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

57
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.223
<v Speaker 1>so I have one assignment for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is writing an autobiography and </v>

58
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>there is a structured program online </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guides you through that.</v>

59
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.114
<v Speaker 1>And basically what it asks you to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to divide your life into seven epochs </v>

60
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.723
<v Speaker 1>stages and then to write about the what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you experienced during those epochs for </v>

61
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:47.134
<v Speaker 1>better or for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to try to understand them and </v>

62
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:54.151
<v Speaker 1>to articulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly I want you to do that because</v>

63
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

64
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing that is good to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for people your age,</v>

65
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.173
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're stopped stopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing which you are going to be </v>

66
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>doing soon in starting another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing to get caught up.</v>

67
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The other reason I want you to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is because this course deals with</v>

68
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.204
<v Speaker 1>narrative in the psychology of narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship between narrative </v>

69
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and your own personal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason not to utilize the</v>

70
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 1>theoretical propositions that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to walk through in a,</v>

71
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.813
<v Speaker 1>in a personal and practical sense at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time that you come to understand </v>

72
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>them theoretically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.263
<v Speaker 1>so you'll be asked to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the first assignment and </v>

74
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>then that will be given two to three of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

75
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.813
<v Speaker 1>Each person's essay will be given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>three classmates and they'll provide </v>

76
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:50.854
<v Speaker 1>feedback on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I usually recommend is that you </v>

77
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.584
<v Speaker 1>write the autobiography for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The program will provide you with a </v>

78
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>complete printout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can edit it,</v>

79
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there may be things that you </v>

80
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>want to write about that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody to read.</v>

81
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.013
<v Speaker 1>Now part of the reason I instituted this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because it's impossible for the tas </v>

82
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.053
<v Speaker 1>to grade and assess that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>assignments because there's three </v>

83
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>assignments and I don't know how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are in the class.</v>

84
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Probably somewhere between 60 and 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess would be 70.</v>

85
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

86
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's 210 assignments.</v>

87
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

88
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.693
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want to cut the writing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the class because I think it's </v>

89
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:34.624
<v Speaker 1>foolish to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we use a peer grading system and the </v>

90
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:38.914
<v Speaker 1>way that works is that you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get feedback from three peers and </v>

91
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you get the average of the best two </v>
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>

92
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also marked on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback that you provide.</v>

93
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.713
<v Speaker 1>Now what's happened in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although this wasn't something I </v>

94
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.384
<v Speaker 1>expected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that students have actually found it </v>

95
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful to read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiographical essays of their peers.</v>

96
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.743
<v Speaker 1>Because you know you don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much about other people and you </v>

97
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.824
<v Speaker 1>don't know how how similar you are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more how different you are from </v>

98
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.214
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true if you're </v>

99
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.554
<v Speaker 1>relatively young and having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to read the kind of writing </v>

100
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to do that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced by other people turns out to be</v>

101
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>something that everyone has found </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily useful.</v>

102
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to take credit for that but I'm</v>

103
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>not going to because I didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that it would be so useful.</v>

104
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.073
<v Speaker 1>And what we're actually going to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>further developments of the program is </v>

105
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:31.084
<v Speaker 1>set it up so that because people do use </v>
<v Speaker 1>this on a private basis and we're using </v>

106
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>it in various places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll talk about in a minute,</v>

107
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to set it up so that when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>use it,</v>

108
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:39.674
<v Speaker 1>they can post their final product online</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have people comment on it and then </v>

109
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>have the comments voted up or down.</v>

110
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.073
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

111
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.243
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about are planning to </v>

112
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.394
<v Speaker 1>develop a site where people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in psychology could go and </v>

113
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:57.164
<v Speaker 1>practice their skills because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful for people to have feedback on </v>

114
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>what they've written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.133
<v Speaker 1>if it's constructive feedback and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive feedback should be </v>

116
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:07.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't understand what you </v>

118
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.480
<v Speaker 1>meant here and this seemed kind of vague</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

119
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I really liked what you did here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's clear,</v>

120
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.664
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be well articulated and </v>

121
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.994
<v Speaker 1>delineated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the next stage of the </v>

122
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>project and that'll be coming along </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively soon.</v>

123
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

124
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.253
<v Speaker 1>you'll start with the autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would recommend that you start it </v>

125
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>now while like not this second because </v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are in this class,</v>

126
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know as soon as possible because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

127
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite demanding.</v>

128
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.353
<v Speaker 1>And if you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that you can't do it and </v>

129
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

130
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the whole purpose of the exercise will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be lost.</v>

131
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.314
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's also extremely useful to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>over multiple occasions and sleep in </v>

132
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:51.611
<v Speaker 1>between writing sessions because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence seems to suggest that if you're</v>

133
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 1>doing autobiographical and exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

134
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.593
<v Speaker 1>that you need the downtime to sleep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to consolidate the changes you're </v>

135
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>making in your representational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

136
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And so doing it over multiple periods is</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

137
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.973
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way really to do it </v>

138
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>because it's too difficult to do it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one sitting,</v>

139
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's also more beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

140
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 1>one thing you might think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

141
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

142
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:15.764
<v Speaker 1>this appears to be this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your personalities actually </v>

143
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>organized at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis through articulation.</v>

144
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>

145
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:24.704
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hierarchical </v>

146
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>

147
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.893
<v Speaker 1>And that that structure has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized and unified because otherwise </v>

148
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>you're like a little collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>warring spirits and that's,</v>

149
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.543
<v Speaker 1>that's not an efficient and effective or</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy way live that involves a lot of </v>

150
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:41.864
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the more you're able to </v>

151
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>articulate yourself as an entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more clearly defined you are.</v>

152
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And the more that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of that clear definition</v>

153
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>in unity is that you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a house that's divided unto itself.</v>

154
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.773
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an extraordinarily useful </v>

155
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.021
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.854
<v Speaker 1>one of the goals for most clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes is the integration of the </v>

157
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

158
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.814
<v Speaker 1>To make you an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an individual is something that's </v>

159
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.543
<v Speaker 1>not divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the autobiographical exercise will </v>

160
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.174
<v Speaker 1>help with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And students have claimed in the past </v>

161
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>and that they've been able to put a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that have been disturbing them</v>

162
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>to rest as a consequence of writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it and thinking about it now,</v>

163
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing particularly magic about</v>

164
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:30.564
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something magic about </v>

165
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:33.054
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

166
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.253
<v Speaker 1>And there's something particularly magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>about thinking accurately and precisely </v>

167
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>about important things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:40.374
<v Speaker 1>and the re the advantage of doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>through writing is that you can be much </v>

169
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>more precise and accurate because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to externalize your thinking,</v>

170
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.443
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is what you do when you write it </v>

171
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.004
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can think about what you </v>

172
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:52.704
<v Speaker 1>thought about so you can engage in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>recursive process that enables you to </v>

173
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:57.474
<v Speaker 1>sharpen up your words and sharpen up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations and extract out the </v>

174
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 1>proper causal relationships that make up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience.</v>

175
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

176
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>the point of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>

177
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:09.504
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of memory is to remember the </v>

178
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>past and that's complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point of memory at all.</v>

179
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.663
<v Speaker 1>The point of memory is to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful information from your experience </v>

180
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>so you don't run into the same wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly as you move through life.</v>

181
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And so if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have things in your past that you</v>

182
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>don't really comprehend and that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still disturbing you,</v>

183
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.823
<v Speaker 1>what that means in some sense is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are areas of the world that you </v>

184
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.094
<v Speaker 1>don't comprehend well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because those areas </v>

185
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:36.414
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you encountered them in the </v>

186
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean they're gone.</v>

187
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.123
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also means that there are places in </v>

188
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:47.571
<v Speaker 1>your past that are in some sense loaded </v>
<v Speaker 1>with information that you can extract.</v>

189
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:48.474
<v Speaker 1>And in some real way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make your psyche out of the </v>

190
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>information that you extract from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

191
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a kind of a Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

192
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

193
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>your psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality comes from somewhere.</v>

194
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't observe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

195
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.613
<v Speaker 1>we emerge out of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can mine your past for </v>

196
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 1>information that you have not completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehended in,</v>

197
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:08.424
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>

198
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>You can expand your personality and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

199
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would also recommend,</v>

200
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 1>and because this is also a motif of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>

201
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>when you do the exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pay attention to your words because</v>

202
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>you're using your words to construct </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality.</v>

203
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

204
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.023
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great discoveries in some </v>

205
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

206
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.623
<v Speaker 1>of human culture is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the word and the </v>

207
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 1>construction of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

208
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

209
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and if you're precise and careful with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your words and with your writing,</v>

210
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>then what you call into existence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a well defined,</v>

211
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 1>at sharply defined personality and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharply defined world.</v>

212
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's one in which you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can act and,</v>

213
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:52.171
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

214
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.004
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obtain the consequences of those </v>

215
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>actions that is necessary to sustain </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

216
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>So I would say if you treat this </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise like a class exercise,</v>

217
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>then you're missing the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

218
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not a class exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

219
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's designed to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up to date,</v>

220
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>to free you from your past and to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to move forward into the future.</v>

221
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Untrammeled by things that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging behind you.</v>

222
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

223
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.943
<v Speaker 1>there are instructions in the program </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tell you what state of mind to </v>

224
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.380
<v Speaker 1>place yourself into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

225
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

226
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.693
<v Speaker 1>I'll describe it briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to be in something that </v>

227
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that's like a reverie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:32.210
<v Speaker 1>when a reverie is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

229
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.083
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a state of mind that allows you in </v>

230
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>some sense to daydream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you're sitting and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily focused on anything,</v>

232
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>which is increasingly rare these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind will wander,</v>

233
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it wanders into the future</v>

234
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it wanders around problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have from day to day.</v>

235
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.711
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it wanders into the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of circle around things that are</v>

236
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>still consuming you.</v>

237
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's the state of mind you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in.</v>

238
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.993
<v Speaker 1>So you can bring up to the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that are relevant and important </v>

239
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>and then start to articulate them and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address them.</v>

240
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the relatively well educated adult </v>

241
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>that you are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and all,</v>

242
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:17.344
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people are hurt by past </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences because they're too young </v>

243
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:20.584
<v Speaker 1>and too cognitively naive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsophisticated to actually understand </v>

244
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and to place it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader context.</v>

245
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become educated and that you're,</v>

247
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well mostly that you've become educated.</v>

248
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.063
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have the opportunity to re </v>

249
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 1>reconstru and recast some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've been thinking about,</v>

250
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and carrying along behind you.</v>

251
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:44.194
<v Speaker 1>So that's assignment one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really would recommend get at it </v>

252
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 1>because it's not something you can do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last moment.</v>

253
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Not without causing yourself misery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grief.</v>

254
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:54.843
<v Speaker 1>The third assignment is it the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of writing exercise except it's about </v>

255
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

256
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:02.014
<v Speaker 1>one of the propositions that this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated upon is the idea that </v>

257
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.083
<v Speaker 1>you're always in a cognitive schema that</v>
<v Speaker 1>contains at least two points of </v>

258
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:11.164
<v Speaker 1>reference and one is point a roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking in one is point b roughly </v>

259
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.084
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that your life is a continual </v>

260
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:18.214
<v Speaker 1>journey between point a and point b and </v>
<v Speaker 1>point a is the present as you construe </v>

261
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:26.971
<v Speaker 1>it and point b is the future that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>heading to and in any moment you're,</v>

262
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.683
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating with both those poles </v>

263
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>active regardless of what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're a goal directed creature,</v>

264
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you're always aiming at something and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

265
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>in order to obtain what you're aiming at</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to keep the structures that</v>

266
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you're using to organize your experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional and pristine,</v>

267
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a well defined sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are now and you need to have a</v>

268
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:54.704
<v Speaker 1>well defined sense of where you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future and why you're going </v>

269
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:58.214
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

270
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this exercise,</v>

271
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:01.454
<v Speaker 1>which is the third assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asks you to put yourself in the same </v>

272
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:05.534
<v Speaker 1>state of mind that would be particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for the past offering </v>

273
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.243
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that you're projecting yourself </v>

274
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>three to five years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

275
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

276
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.690
<v Speaker 1>probably only emerges at about the age </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all you guys are.</v>

277
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I've tried doing this exercise with high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school kids and it's,</v>

278
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.593
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're making a high school version </v>

279
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.923
<v Speaker 1>where the kids have to think three to </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months into the future because that </v>

280
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 1>seems to be really all they can manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

281
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

282
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>but you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at a point where you know,</v>

283
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:38.804
<v Speaker 1>you can cast a future self farther out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is to put yourself in </v>

284
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.553
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adopt a particular attitude towards </v>

285
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.660
<v Speaker 1>yourself while you're writing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

286
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're completing the access size.</v>

287
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And that attitude is imagine that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's,</v>

288
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 1>who's care you're charged with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

289
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:00.524
<v Speaker 1>So what I really mean is to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicate yourself and to take a </v>

290
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>particular attitude towards your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

291
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is if you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct a future for a person,</v>

292
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>that person being you and the future was</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimized,</v>

293
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 1>not in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>moronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamlike manner,</v>

295
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that that involves yachts and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

296
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and supermodels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

297
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but something that's realistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you can actually apply.</v>

298
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So if you were constructing the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be best for you,</v>

299
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

300
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.893
<v Speaker 1>And so the first part of the exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>asks you to consider what I regard as </v>

301
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental dimensions of human</v>

302
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

303
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>those already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes up life,</v>

304
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

305
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships,</v>

306
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.353
<v Speaker 1>activities that you undertake on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own time and concerns that are related </v>

307
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>to health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including use of drugs and alcohol.</v>

308
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So those aren't the only dimensions but </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental dimensions.</v>

309
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:04.094
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm asking you to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the program will ask you to do is </v>

310
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.211
<v Speaker 1>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

311
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>if you could optimize your life along </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those dimensions,</v>

312
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:11.774
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one thing you can be sure of is </v>

313
00:17:15.081 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>that if you're not aiming at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit it.</v>

314
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you can be sure of is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not aiming at something,</v>

315
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.033
<v Speaker 1>someone else will aim you at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason or some force that you </v>

316
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:25.514
<v Speaker 1>don't understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll aim you at something and you may </v>

317
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:28.304
<v Speaker 1>end up getting something you seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want and I would not recommend </v>

318
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stumbling through your life.</v>

319
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Aimlessly is not a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up,</v>

320
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.803
<v Speaker 1>you could end up some terrible places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will certainly end up as a pawn </v>

321
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>of things that you may not want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pawn of.</v>

322
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.093
<v Speaker 1>Now we've used this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've tested this program quite </v>

323
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've used it for to begin with.</v>

324
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>We used it for students at mcgill who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were struggling academically,</v>

325
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:57.980
<v Speaker 1>so you know there are smart kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were all,</v>

326
00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.883
<v Speaker 1>they were on academic probation and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled out the future authoring program </v>

327
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:03.654
<v Speaker 1>and raise their grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point average is 25% drop the dropout </v>

328
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:07.404
<v Speaker 1>rate by 30% and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite stunning because it's </v>

329
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to improve people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to make the mortars but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder to make them better.</v>

331
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.253
<v Speaker 1>But then we've tested it now on more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 3000 students at the Rotterdam </v>

332
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.143
<v Speaker 1>School of management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over four successive years we've </v>

333
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:28.611
<v Speaker 1>raised the performance of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>25% drop their dropout rate by 30% seems</v>

334
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 1>to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Rotterdam samples.</v>

335
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:32.064
<v Speaker 1>It was particularly effective for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know what conclusions to </v>

336
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 1>draw from that because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

337
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 1>it's business program and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority of women,</v>

338
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but they were outperforming the man.</v>

339
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.733
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know if that's a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or if the women who were in the </v>

340
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 1>business program happened on average to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be more committed and more intelligent,</v>

341
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious than the men who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

342
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.423
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is is that it will ask you to </v>

343
00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 1>consider those fundamental dimensions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and to,</v>

344
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.243
<v Speaker 1>and to envision how they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed if you could construct them </v>

345
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:06.684
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it asks you to write for 20 </v>

346
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:09.234
<v Speaker 1>minutes after you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what your future could be like in </v>

347
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 1>three to five years if it was optimally </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured free writing.</v>

348
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And then it asks you to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the reverse,</v>

349
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:18.234
<v Speaker 1>which is consider all your inadequacies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and weaknesses and stupidities and </v>

350
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:22.734
<v Speaker 1>foolishness and imagine what your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like if you really let them </v>

351
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.680
<v Speaker 1>have the upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

352
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and everybody I think has some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

353
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone has some sense of how </v>

354
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:36.150
<v Speaker 1>they would go wrong if they were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go wrong.</v>

355
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.343
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be a very useful </v>

356
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:44.061
<v Speaker 1>exercise to allow yourself to envision </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could end up if you didn't get</v>

357
00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>your act together and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

358
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and put things straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me in some sense,</v>

359
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:52.040
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you're outlining</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own personal heaven,</v>

360
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.883
<v Speaker 1>then your own personal hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's useful to have both of those </v>

361
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:56.544
<v Speaker 1>because you can run away from what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want and you can run towards what </v>

362
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 1>you do want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite motivating,</v>

363
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.143
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've observed </v>

364
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:05.394
<v Speaker 1>quite regularly in my clinical practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people are often loath to make </v>

365
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>decisions that will cause conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

366
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>so say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're agreeable people,</v>

367
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:17.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that you want to pursue a career </v>

368
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:23.541
<v Speaker 1>path that your parents don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would take a fair bit of,</v>

369
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense negotiation in order to free </v>

370
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself up so that you could pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that path.</v>

371
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It may be just as easy to let it go from</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment to moment because that's conflict</v>

372
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 1>free and end up doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not committed to.</v>

373
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll,</v>

374
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 1>where does that take you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a very,</v>

375
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.124
<v Speaker 1>very clear idea of the kind of trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get into by facing the actual </v>

376
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:49.264
<v Speaker 1>realities of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you much more likely to fight </v>

377
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 1>for what you need to fight for in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

378
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

379
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>in some sense you're damned if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're damned if you don't.</v>

380
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So you might as well take the chance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle for what you want now.</v>

381
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And so defining a negative future can </v>
<v Speaker 1>also be extremely useful.</v>

382
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

383
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.640
<v Speaker 1>plus it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's realistic.</v>

385
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.110
<v Speaker 1>People's lives fall apart all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

386
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can expect that your life will fall </v>

387
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 1>apart at some point in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

388
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's useful at least to prepare </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that that doesn't happen any</v>

389
00:21:23.541 --> 00:21:24.374
<v Speaker 1>more often than it has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that if you're going to engage in </v>

390
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 1>conflict and so forth in order to pursue</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

391
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:30.934
<v Speaker 1>that you have your rationale straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the second part of the third part of </v>

392
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:39.661
<v Speaker 1>the exercise has you develop a fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated rationale for your vision.</v>

393
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

394
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're having a discussion with </v>

395
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.074
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you how the typical </v>

396
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 1>discussion about something important </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

397
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're having a conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

398
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's usually someone close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like person in your family,</v>

399
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll bring up something they don't </v>

400
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:57.910
<v Speaker 1>want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

401
00:21:57.911 --> 00:21:58.744
<v Speaker 1>So then they'll tell you two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why that's actually your fault </v>

402
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and not theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can,</v>

403
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that'll set you right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your heels.</v>

404
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the end of the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're quite emphatic and</v>

405
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:09.604
<v Speaker 1>maybe aggressive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get past that and engage in </v>

406
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the discussion and start to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere while then they'll usually get</v>

407
00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:19.510
<v Speaker 1>angry at you and then past that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>cry.</v>

408
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And then past that you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

409
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 1>But in order to get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually have a discussion,</v>

410
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to have your arguments set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like soldiers behind you.</v>

411
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to move towards a particular</v>

412
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run into impediments.</v>

413
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:36.874
<v Speaker 1>And some of those impediments will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and the voices in your own </v>

414
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.534
<v Speaker 1>head for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more deeply you have your </v>

415
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>rationale for what you want articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more potent you are as a fighter for</v>

416
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>your own destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

417
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the third part of the exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>asks you to think deeply about why it is</v>

418
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that the future you want is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only to you,</v>

419
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>because of course it's important that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to you,</v>

420
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.854
<v Speaker 1>but also what effect moving towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future that you actually think would be </v>

421
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:08.374
<v Speaker 1>best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what effect that would have on your </v>

422
00:23:09.881 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 1>friends and your family and society at </v>
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>

423
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Because those things also have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken into consideration when you're </v>

424
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 1>constructing what you might regard as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny.</v>

425
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And so these are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important things to get right.</v>

426
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:24.394
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably pathological about our </v>

427
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:28.054
<v Speaker 1>current education system is that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing isn't done more regularly </v>

428
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>because I can't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you know,</v>

429
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:34.954
<v Speaker 1>you're all university students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely nothing more </v>

430
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:41.761
<v Speaker 1>important than you can possibly do then </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend some genuine time contemplating</v>

431
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 1>who it is that you want to be as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand yourself throughout life.</v>

432
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be whole courses devoted to</v>

433
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 1>that and there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's weird reasons for that,</v>

434
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 1>which I'll get into later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

435
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:55.371
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

436
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 1>it gives you an opportunity to thank all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

437
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could have what would be best </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

438
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is different than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>

439
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could have what would be best </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me if I knew what it was.</v>

440
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And I was actually aiming at it and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience has been like,</v>

441
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.114
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years in all sorts of different </v>

442
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:13.934
<v Speaker 1>situations and over very long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because I've had a clinical </v>

443
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>practice for more than 20 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that if you know what</v>

444
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:22.214
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty decent chance you can </v>

445
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know what you're aiming</v>

446
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:26.534
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then God only knows where you're going </v>

447
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 1>to end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it will not be a happy place.</v>

448
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's very much useful to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put some thought into this and to,</v>

449
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.163
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to consciously take hold of and </v>

450
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>articulate what it is that you want for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a destiny.</v>

451
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to assume that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't achieve it.</v>

452
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all smart.</v>

453
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.333
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't be here and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably hard working or maybe </v>

454
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:50.414
<v Speaker 1>extremely hardworking or you wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and a good chunk of your probably </v>

455
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

456
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you have as good a chance of attaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

457
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 1>what you could be as anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

458
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say dream realistically,</v>

459
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:05.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maturely that would be a better way </v>

460
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also don't be afraid to be ambitious</v>

461
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:11.834
<v Speaker 1>about what you want because you know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's full of possibility and there's </v>

462
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 1>no necessary reason that you can't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of that possibility.</v>

463
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.843
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you as well that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better make use of it because although </v>

464
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know this to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

465
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.283
<v Speaker 1>at some of you do anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life hits you hard and tragically </v>

466
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.760
<v Speaker 1>multiple times throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

467
00:25:37.761 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And no one escapes from that.</v>

468
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.933
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that it's painful </v>

469
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety provoking and use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can make you bitter.</v>

470
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And once you're bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dangerous person and,</v>

471
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.083
<v Speaker 1>and a miserable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the only way to protect yourself </v>

472
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:56.654
<v Speaker 1>against that happening is to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of life that's rich enough and </v>

473
00:25:59.151 --> 00:25:59.984
<v Speaker 1>meaningful enough so that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take the blows and accept it </v>

474
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.890
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way you can escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the blows there.</v>

475
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.763
<v Speaker 1>They are an inevitable part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your life better be rich enough so </v>

476
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

477
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 1>well on balance the price I paid for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being alive is worth it.</v>

478
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we're going to talk </v>

479
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:20.384
<v Speaker 1>about in depth in this class is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social consequences of failing to do </v>

480
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Speaker 1>that because bitter people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary,</v>

481
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.943
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary dangerous from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological and a political </v>

482
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:30.794
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

483
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:33.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

485
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:33.933
<v Speaker 1>the ranks of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the totalitarians of the past are </v>

486
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 1>full of people who are arrogant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and you know,</v>

487
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>that the steps past arrogance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment are,</v>

488
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder and genocide.</v>

489
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the less of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

491
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:47.484
<v Speaker 1>So part of the utility and putting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal house in order is that you're </v>

492
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:51.624
<v Speaker 1>much less likely to be a pathological </v>
<v Speaker 1>force on the sociological and political </v>

493
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

494
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.533
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is extremely important work and we </v>

495
00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>already know from the empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

496
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough that it seems to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very profound effect on people.</v>

497
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

498
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>so the other assignment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

499
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 1>an essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can write an essay on your choice of</v>

500
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:15.864
<v Speaker 1>topic as long as the topic is related in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some intelligible way to the course </v>

501
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.064
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really leaves you quite a wide </v>

502
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:22.494
<v Speaker 1>range of choice.</v>

503
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And it can be a scientific essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be a philosophical essay,</v>

504
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 1>and it can also be a creative project if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do that.</v>

505
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Although if you choose to do a creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

506
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 1>then you have to write a commentary on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

507
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.453
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in some sense you have the </v>

508
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to engage in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>project you'd like to engage in.</v>

509
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 1>As long as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

510
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 1>it has some relevance to the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was those three assignments,</v>

511
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:46.494
<v Speaker 1>there's the readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a final exam at the </v>

512
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 1>very end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the final exam is multiple choice,</v>

513
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:52.194
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the stick that goes along with </v>

514
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:55.801
<v Speaker 1>the carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things I've observed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the class is the reading is difficult</v>

516
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and you actually don't have to do it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the class.</v>

517
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And so of course people don't do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

518
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 1>not because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while sometimes because they're lazy and</v>

519
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:09.174
<v Speaker 1>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly because they prioritize </v>

520
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:11.904
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their time because their time demands </v>

521
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>are heavy and things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely crucial don't get done.</v>

522
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So the exam makes it crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do the reading you,</v>

523
00:28:20.681 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you won't have any trouble with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exam.</v>

524
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:23.154
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do the reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will have trouble with the </v>

525
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:25.704
<v Speaker 1>exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say do the reading and stay </v>

526
00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:28.114
<v Speaker 1>caught up because it'll make the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>richer experience and plus he'll do </v>

527
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:33.170
<v Speaker 1>better on the final exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

528
00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>so that's basically the outline of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

529
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:37.164
<v Speaker 1>Now what I'm going to do is walk you </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the material fundamentally and </v>

530
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 1>try to explain more deeply why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>

531
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 1>And one of my aims in this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm not a fan of,</v>

532
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.073
<v Speaker 1>of information for information sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's a mistake to pursue </v>

533
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:55.380
<v Speaker 1>information that isn't relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

534
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you can pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think it might become relevant in</v>

535
00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:58.860
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

536
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a calculated risk.</v>

537
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:01.853
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to teach you anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this class that you don't find </v>

538
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:05.424
<v Speaker 1>immediately compelling and useful both </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally and on the broader social </v>

539
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:11.304
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the information that I'm </v>

540
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:14.230
<v Speaker 1>going to provide to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

541
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

542
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.843
<v Speaker 1>I truly do not believe that you can live</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly without knowing what I'm going </v>

543
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

544
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:23.664
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that's kind of a </v>

545
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.374
<v Speaker 1>grandiose claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also not trying to take credit </v>

546
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 1>for the content of the information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to purvey.</v>

547
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a long time analyzing,</v>

548
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.080
<v Speaker 1>analyzing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

549
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental elements of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories of the past.</v>

550
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And people are historical creatures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they're grounded in the past,</v>

551
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 1>unless they're grounded in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they float up and disappear and it's not</v>

552
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.760
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to know,</v>

553
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:52.594
<v Speaker 1>and especially modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people have to understand to </v>

554
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:56.674
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

555
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

556
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.240
<v Speaker 1>But we paid a big price for it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

557
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.403
<v Speaker 1>our demand to understand has made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for us to have any faith in </v>

558
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:07.024
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>have believed throughout the entire </v>

559
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:10.324
<v Speaker 1>course of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes modern people in some </v>

560
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 1>sense educated but bereft or </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically week.</v>

561
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.733
<v Speaker 1>And they're often nihilistic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed in either of </v>

562
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:21.574
<v Speaker 1>those two things is those are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illnesses as far as I'm </v>

563
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:24.904
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I also believe that the material in </v>

564
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 1>the course serves as a vaccination </v>
<v Speaker 1>against ideological possession.</v>

565
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.793
<v Speaker 1>And I think that ideological possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was certainly the social </v>

566
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology that threatened the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world most in the 20th century,</v>

567
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:44.671
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if we could rid ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tendency to adopt mindless single</v>

568
00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:45.664
<v Speaker 1>cause explanations for things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused that with actual education and </v>

569
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to outline to some degree what</v>

570
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:53.764
<v Speaker 1>I think it he ologies are and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so pernicious and also to </v>

571
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:58.384
<v Speaker 1>provide you with what I think of as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to ideological thinking </v>

572
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that's still grounded in what's grounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in meaning fundamentally.</v>

573
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.583
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

574
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:08.883
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to tell you that </v>

575
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:13.150
<v Speaker 1>after the break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that didn't happen.</v>

576
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

577
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 1>do you have any questions about that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with?</v>

578
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I cause then I want to tell you this </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

579
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:20.164
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

580
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

581
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.553
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

582
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

583
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.143
<v Speaker 1>be do it's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is go online and you </v>

584
00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 1>can sign up for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

585
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:36.150
<v Speaker 1>for the writing assignments you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate a username and password.</v>

586
00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:38.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it isn't functional,</v>

587
00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:38.874
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I last time I checked that it was </v>

588
00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:41.100
<v Speaker 1>functional in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:42.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty reliable.</v>

590
00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:43.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

591
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.020
<v Speaker 1>you can start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start right away.</v>

592
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You just find the website and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

593
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

594
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.253
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

595
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:09.384
<v Speaker 1>the next time you have a really intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with someone about something </v>

597
00:32:11.581 --> 00:32:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that's important and just watch what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens if you don't quit,</v>

598
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will quit if you're not grounded</v>

599
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:20.550
<v Speaker 1>in what you say firmly and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it through like mad,</v>

600
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:21.384
<v Speaker 1>like what right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to impose any suffering on </v>

601
00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:23.874
<v Speaker 1>someone to make a point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what you're talking </v>

602
00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:27.660
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no right at all.</v>

603
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know there's lots of times when </v>

604
00:32:30.331 --> 00:32:31.164
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with people in intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships where you have a conflict </v>

605
00:32:33.361 --> 00:32:37.110
<v Speaker 1>of viewpoint and interest and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can either ignore that,</v>

606
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>which means you sweep it under the rug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very thing to do</v>

607
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.053
<v Speaker 3>or you can fight it through and to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>it through means that you're going to </v>

608
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:44.834
<v Speaker 3>cause emotional upset in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people shy away from that and </v>

609
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:48.860
<v Speaker 3>rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

610
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:49.694
<v Speaker 3>because it can get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem was shying away from it </v>

611
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 3>is that it's a small problem right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your eyes are open,</v>

612
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 3>you can see that it's going to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a large problem in the future.</v>

613
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 3>If you address it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to cause conflict,</v>

614
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing like the complete hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it'll generate if you let it go.</v>

615
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.893
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to fortify yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>property to engage in that kind of </v>

616
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:09.470
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

617
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of battles that will take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place throughout your whole life.</v>

618
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 3>If you want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to have a raise for example,</v>

619
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 3>or if you want to deal with a bully at </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

620
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 3>or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

621
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 3>any time that your autonomy or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom is challenged or that your sense</v>

622
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 3>of moral propriety is challenged so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are trying to get you to do,</v>

623
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 3>say something that you believe to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

624
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're not fortified with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with arguments like,</v>

625
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.813
<v Speaker 3>like a general in charge of soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to get walked all </v>

626
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a good thing.</v>

627
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:36.824
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to be a helpless victim is a bad </v>

628
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:39.734
<v Speaker 3>destiny and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly pollutes your psyche to </v>

629
00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:42.674
<v Speaker 3>also be in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to make yourself into </v>

630
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:45.884
<v Speaker 3>something that's formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way to do that in a civilized </v>

631
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 3>society is to make yourself a master of </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

632
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.910
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

633
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the philosophical sense and words</v>

634
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 3>that have meaning and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind,</v>

635
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.074
<v Speaker 3>that you're willing to stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that it's not the same as say </v>

636
00:34:03.201 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 3>trying to win an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

637
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.523
<v Speaker 3>if you're smart and you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that you have an intimate </v>

638
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 3>relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never tried to win the argument.</v>

639
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the Hell is good?</v>

640
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Is that going to do you still have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live with the person,</v>

641
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just take their revenge on you </v>

642
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 3>some way if you win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you want to do is solve the damn</v>

643
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that usually takes a bit of a war.</v>

644
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you better be ready for a war.</v>

645
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:24.974
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be the loser and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the person you're fighting with </v>

646
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 3>will be the loser too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

647
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to tell you a story and there's a</v>

648
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 3>bunch of reasons I want to tell you this</v>
<v Speaker 3>story and one is,</v>

649
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:36.464
<v Speaker 3>is because the story illustrates very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well how unbelievably profound </v>

650
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 3>archetipal revelations manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in very,</v>

651
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:48.584
<v Speaker 3>very simple form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm going to read you a story </v>

652
00:34:51.321 --> 00:34:52.154
<v Speaker 3>that's written for four year olds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a variant of the oldest story that </v>

653
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>humanity has ever told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that we know what the oldest</v>

654
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:03.080
<v Speaker 3>writings are that we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dredge up and translate.</v>

655
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And this is a variant of a story called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

656
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to pronounce this </v>
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>

657
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.353
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Enuma elish which was a Sumerian </v>

658
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 3>story from thousands of years ago that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually quite nicely documented.</v>

659
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:17.084
<v Speaker 3>We have the tablets and so forth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were discovered in the late 18 </v>

660
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:20.324
<v Speaker 3>hundreds but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very intimate hero's story as </v>

661
00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:24.344
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hero stories are the story of </v>

662
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:26.804
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally a hero myth is the story </v>

663
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.580
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the individual in society.</v>

664
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.013
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason that hero mythology </v>
<v Speaker 3>for example is so absolutely potent is </v>

665
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 3>because it provides the grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure for,</v>

666
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.423
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for understanding your life and laying </v>

667
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:43.524
<v Speaker 3>it out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a small variant of that </v>

668
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:46.900
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

669
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 3>it'll give you an idea as we walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>

670
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.750
<v Speaker 3>how this sort of information is </v>
<v Speaker 3>transmitted.</v>

671
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.273
<v Speaker 3>It'll give you some indication of how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you understand such information </v>

672
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 3>even though you don't know that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it.</v>

673
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Because this story obviously is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something completely fictional.</v>

674
00:36:03.581 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 3>One fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

675
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.360
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you can tell,</v>

676
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:08.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a story about a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

677
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:09.414
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you have watched a movie </v>

678
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Speaker 3>about a dragon in the last year?</v>

679
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

680
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anybody who hasn't?</v>

681
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't,</v>

682
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.270
<v Speaker 3>you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

683
00:36:20.271 --> 00:36:22.280
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that you could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid that.</v>

684
00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

685
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.001
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:36:26.001 --> 00:36:28.550
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of strange because of course</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things don't exist.</v>

687
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:29.384
<v Speaker 3>And so you might ask yourself what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what accounts for their absolutely </v>

688
00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:36.110
<v Speaker 3>enduring popularity and even their coat </v>
<v Speaker 3>like popularity.</v>

689
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Cause you see that with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

690
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.653
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in Harry Potter because there's a </v>

691
00:36:40.161 --> 00:36:42.560
<v Speaker 3>dragon in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple dragons and Harry Potter,</v>

692
00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:44.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the second volume,</v>

693
00:36:44.091 --> 00:36:46.250
<v Speaker 3>there's the basilisk that lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath the school,</v>

694
00:36:46.251 --> 00:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very archetypal idea.</v>

695
00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:49.304
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there's the harbor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's how to train your </v>

696
00:36:51.381 --> 00:36:52.214
<v Speaker 3>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like there's dragons in </v>

697
00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.880
<v Speaker 3>sleeping beauty and like there's dragons</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

698
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:56.714
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's why this boy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>this problem is that he sees them </v>

699
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:01.400
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

700
00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:02.840
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

701
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.003
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

702
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.180
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to walk through this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to explain to you some of what</v>

703
00:37:08.181 --> 00:37:09.014
<v Speaker 3>it means.</v>

704
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.530
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about this illustration,</v>

705
00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:16.370
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if the author Jack </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't or the illustrator knew this,</v>

706
00:37:16.371 --> 00:37:17.204
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of this figure called a </v>

707
00:37:20.601 --> 00:37:21.890
<v Speaker 3>neuro burroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

708
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.070
<v Speaker 3>like in a world in circling serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

709
00:37:25.071 --> 00:37:26.930
<v Speaker 3>very frequent that the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

710
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.793
<v Speaker 3>the entity has a twist and its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from what I've been able to </v>

711
00:37:30.801 --> 00:37:33.380
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that twist represents infinity.</v>

712
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.510
<v Speaker 3>So the dragon in part is something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>represents what's beat,</v>

713
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.360
<v Speaker 3>what's continually beyond our realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

714
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.110
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a very complicated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And an echo is everywhere.</v>

715
00:37:45.111 --> 00:37:45.944
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one thing you can think of is that </v>

716
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:50.150
<v Speaker 3>there's always something that's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>your realm of knowledge,</v>

717
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.493
<v Speaker 3>your realm of competence and ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another thing that you can think of </v>

718
00:37:54.591 --> 00:37:56.830
<v Speaker 3>is that people have known this for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and it's,</v>

719
00:37:56.831 --> 00:37:57.664
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange form of knowledge because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's knowledge about the limits of </v>

720
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:00.710
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

721
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.543
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Meta knowledge and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can generalize from that Matt </v>

722
00:38:04.611 --> 00:38:06.710
<v Speaker 3>and knowledge to some degree because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can say,</v>

723
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.600
<v Speaker 3>well as you go through your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a lot of problems.</v>

724
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.570
<v Speaker 3>And then you could also say as you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through your life,</v>

725
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.433
<v Speaker 3>a lot of unexpected things will happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and many of them will be </v>

726
00:38:18.771 --> 00:38:21.050
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can say,</v>

727
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.033
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that means is that you can </v>

728
00:38:23.031 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize a class of unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

729
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.493
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The class of unexpected things is all </v>

730
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 3>the potential unexpected things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might happen to you.</v>

731
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.980
<v Speaker 3>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

732
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>how do I deal with an unexpected</v>

733
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.873
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you learn how </v>

734
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>as you deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also ask yourself,</v>

735
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.093
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal with the class of all </v>

736
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 1>unexpected things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole different question.</v>

737
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some sense that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary religious question.</v>

738
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It deals with the fundamental realities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

739
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.233
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things outside your domain of </v>

740
00:38:57.251 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 1>competence outside of the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence of your culture.</v>

741
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.143
<v Speaker 1>And you will have to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you deal with them one by one </v>

742
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.003
<v Speaker 1>or can you deal with them as a class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I would </v>

743
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.350
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

744
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.793
<v Speaker 1>offer you as a hypothesis is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures like the dragon are symbolic </v>

745
00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:16.504
<v Speaker 1>representations of the class of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that lie outside of your </v>

746
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:24.511
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see the figure of the serpent or</v>

747
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.074
<v Speaker 1>the dragon in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to a dwelling in very </v>

748
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 1>many stories.</v>

749
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.670
<v Speaker 1>So one story for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this motif comes up in is the story</v>

750
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:34.504
<v Speaker 1>in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of Adam and Eve because </v>

751
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:36.634
<v Speaker 1>there's a serpent in the garden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the same idea as the </v>

752
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:40.594
<v Speaker 1>dragon in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same idea as the fact </v>

753
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:44.164
<v Speaker 1>that no matter how hard you try to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment that you're in stable </v>

754
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:49.234
<v Speaker 1>and secure the things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and don't know how to deal </v>

755
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.510
<v Speaker 1>with her going to poke their head inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

756
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of keeping so to speak.</v>

757
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of keeping the snakes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the garden.</v>

758
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the wrong approach.</v>

759
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could build a fence that's 200</v>

760
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:06.964
<v Speaker 1>feet high and that's drilled a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet into the ground that's made out of </v>

761
00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:09.904
<v Speaker 1>solid concrete and put a cap on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in the middle of that and not let </v>

762
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:15.490
<v Speaker 1>anything in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in first of all,</v>

763
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a bad strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even not,</v>

764
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.314
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand can emerge </v>

765
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 1>inside of you as well.</v>

766
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.703
<v Speaker 1>And that happens for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you get sick or every time </v>

767
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:26.704
<v Speaker 1>your body does something that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect or want it to is there's no </v>

768
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:31.174
<v Speaker 1>escape from this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly what this story is </v>

769
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this little boy,</v>

770
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

771
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 1>he's maturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's growing up,</v>

772
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 1>he's becoming self conscious and he's at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an age because he's about three or four,</v>

773
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:43.744
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's at an age where selfconsciousness </v>

774
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.970
<v Speaker 1>actually seems to emerge in children </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they become aware of themselves as</v>

775
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.043
<v Speaker 1>really separate creatures and often </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to concern themselves with </v>

776
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.490
<v Speaker 1>covering up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting clothes on,</v>

777
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.970
<v Speaker 1>not being naked around other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:40:56.971 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and some children care about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some don't.</v>

779
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:00.124
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is the age approximately that </v>

780
00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it develops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

781
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this boy,</v>

782
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 1>he's in his house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in his window and he's become aware</v>

783
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:13.030
<v Speaker 1>of something that's at least perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

784
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

785
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 1>well given the size of the dragon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also terrifying,</v>

786
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:17.584
<v Speaker 1>but we'll start with perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because what's perplexing can turn </v>

787
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>into what's terrifying if you ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

788
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly what this book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to present.</v>

789
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It's funny cause it's a cute little </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

790
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:32.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

791
00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cute little</v>

792
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

793
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.120
<v Speaker 3>so there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What sort of facial expression is that?</v>

794
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surprise.</v>

795
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

796
00:41:55.011 --> 00:41:56.990
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the kid wakes up,</v>

797
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 3>do something on his bed.</v>

798
00:41:59.090 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

799
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.020
<v Speaker 3>He's not sure whether he should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid.</v>

800
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 3>We're interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he sorta both.</v>

801
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:03.291
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

802
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like a startle response in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

803
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 3>but at least it's a focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of focused attention.</v>

804
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.780
<v Speaker 3>He's discovered something.</v>

805
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Billy bixby</v>

806
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 3>was rather surprised when he woke up one</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and found a dragon in this room.</v>

807
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a small dragon about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a kitten.</v>

808
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 3>The dragon wagged it's tail happily when</v>
<v Speaker 3>billy padded padded it's head.</v>

809
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so well what can we observe about that?</v>

810
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:28.341
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

811
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 3>something unexpected has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

812
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.300
<v Speaker 3>And for a little kid that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>capture their imagination,</v>

813
00:42:33.301 --> 00:42:33.990
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

814
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that scary or,</v>

815
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's billy going to do?</v>

816
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:39.960
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

817
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 3>it said narrative hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something unexpected has happened.</v>

818
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:43.941
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

819
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:44.774
<v Speaker 3>and it's paradoxical to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a dragon and billy is </v>

820
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 3>surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a small dragon.</v>

821
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:50.260
<v Speaker 3>It's only the size of a kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

822
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 3>kittens book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids know about Kittens,</v>

823
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 3>they're soft and cuddly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got claws,</v>

824
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:56.810
<v Speaker 3>but they're basically harmless and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

825
00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:57.943
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when billy interacts with the dragon at </v>

826
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 3>this size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually wags his tail and is happy.</v>

827
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:03.944
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a paradoxical situation set up </v>

828
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 3>for the boy right at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the narrative,</v>

829
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 3>which is something unexpected happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has ambivalent significance.</v>

830
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.610
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's interested in it and he's alert</v>

831
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 3>to its possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's about as far as it goes.</v>

832
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.443
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

833
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 3>really does what the logical child would</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

834
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 3>It's called referencing by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

835
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a child in a room and I'm,</v>

836
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:36.270
<v Speaker 3>I was runs by the child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will orient towards it,</v>

837
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 3>follow it with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with its size and its head.</v>

838
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And then if the parent is around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the child will reference the mother</v>

839
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:48.970
<v Speaker 3>or the father and read off the mother's </v>
<v Speaker 3>face what the significance of that event</v>

840
00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:50.451
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

841
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

842
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:52.214
<v Speaker 3>it's unclassified significance </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically interesting because it's </v>

843
00:43:55.851 --> 00:44:00.851
<v Speaker 3>unexpected and fast enough to alert you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to produce an orienting response so that</v>

844
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:04.190
<v Speaker 3>you attend to it and that it demands </v>
<v Speaker 3>classification.</v>

845
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 3>So it starts off interesting and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially upsetting.</v>

846
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 3>That's how it manifested itself to begin</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

847
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.090
<v Speaker 3>And then the referencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>

848
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.003
<v Speaker 3>the look at the mother's face allows the</v>
<v Speaker 3>child to utilize the wisdom of the </v>

849
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.210
<v Speaker 3>parent in order to rapidly classified </v>
<v Speaker 3>the significance of the event.</v>

850
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.280
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

851
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mother says,</v>

852
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.580
<v Speaker 3>oh well it's just a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll take care of it later.</v>

853
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 3>That's one reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other reaction is,</v>

854
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:29.924
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she jumps up on the table and has a </v>

855
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.973
<v Speaker 3>screaming fit and then calls the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital could be cause she has a panic </v>

856
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the meaning of the mouse under</v>

857
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 3>those two circumstances is very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

858
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she could also say,</v>

859
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.413
<v Speaker 3>well there aren't any mice here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also a rather pathological </v>

860
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 3>response but perhaps not as bad as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>full fledged panic attack.</v>

861
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.693
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that's children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The part of the point of that is that </v>

862
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 3>when a child encounters something </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexpected,</v>

863
00:44:57.211 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 3>so that's outside of their domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence,</v>

864
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 3>it does attract their interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the laureate towards it and explore it.</v>

865
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:03.474
<v Speaker 3>But then they'll use whatever cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>information is that at hand to classify </v>

866
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 3>the phenomena so they know what to do in</v>
<v Speaker 3>its presence from then on.</v>

867
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.563
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing to think </v>

868
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:14.634
<v Speaker 3>about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a couple of things that </v>

869
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 3>you can think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mouse.</v>

870
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 3>One is what is a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like a scientific question.</v>

871
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 3>And the other is if there's a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should you do?</v>

872
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.363
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a scientific question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a moral question because it has </v>

873
00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:34.341
<v Speaker 3>to do with behavior and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that when you're attempting</v>

874
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:37.590
<v Speaker 3>to classify a phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that you're set up,</v>

875
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Speaker 3>given that you're a living creature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're very much action predicated,</v>

876
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 3>is that when you're trying to classify a</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena,</v>

877
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.890
<v Speaker 3>it's implication for behavior is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important than its objective nature.</v>

878
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.273
<v Speaker 3>And so almost all the knowledge that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that grounds you in the world is </v>

879
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 3>actually information about how to behave</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the presence of things.</v>

880
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.923
<v Speaker 3>It's not information about what they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>from an objective perspective and your </v>

881
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:03.560
<v Speaker 3>brain is set up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're out.</v>

882
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 3>You're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much action oriented peak.</v>

883
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Well obviously because you inhabit a </v>
<v Speaker 3>body that moves and your primary problem</v>

884
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 3>in life is what to do with your body as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you move through space and time.</v>

885
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's a particular category of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

886
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's the category that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially moral and the the ideas that</v>

887
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:24.720
<v Speaker 3>underlie the essential categories of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of action,</v>

888
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 3>moral action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our religious ideas,</v>

889
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:27.624
<v Speaker 3>or at least that's a claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that puts them in a completely </v>

890
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 3>different category than scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

891
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:33.774
<v Speaker 3>And it also places them somewhere where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no necessary conflict between </v>

892
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:40.170
<v Speaker 3>the objective and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the behavioral.</v>

893
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.393
<v Speaker 3>You have to know how to behave and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science does not tell you that in fact </v>

894
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:44.664
<v Speaker 3>it can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the scientific method is </v>

895
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:47.784
<v Speaker 3>actually designed so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational significance of objects or </v>

896
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:55.770
<v Speaker 3>entities is stripped off them before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation begins.</v>

897
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:56.783
<v Speaker 3>You have to treat the phenomena as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's objective and neutral </v>

898
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:00.534
<v Speaker 3>insignificance and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that things are </v>

899
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>objective and neutral insignificance.</v>

900
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.553
<v Speaker 3>It just means that for the sake of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain set of processes which are </v>

901
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:13.200
<v Speaker 3>basically associated with the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>method,</v>

902
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you have to undertake that operation </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you start the game.</v>

903
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's very pathological turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>in human history that we've confused the</v>

904
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:27.450
<v Speaker 3>necessity of stripping off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance from something before.</v>

905
00:47:27.451 --> 00:47:28.284
<v Speaker 3>You can study it scientifically with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that things have no significance </v>

906
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely debatable point.</v>

907
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not how your brain is set</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

908
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you might think,</v>

909
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 3>well your brain evolved while that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>

910
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might say,</v>

911
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did it evolve in relationship to?</v>

912
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 3>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

913
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:49.264
<v Speaker 3>it evolved in relationship to reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's actually how you define </v>

914
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're a Darwinian and the</v>

915
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.494
<v Speaker 3>way your brain reacts to things is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it assesses their motivational </v>

916
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 3>significance first.</v>

917
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

918
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.860
<v Speaker 3>how can you justify the claim that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational significance isn't real?</v>

919
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 3>And answer as far as I'm concerned is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

920
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 3>the motivational significance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something might be the most real element</v>

921
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:13.774
<v Speaker 3>of it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you certainly act like that even if </v>

922
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe it technically or or </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationally.</v>

923
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.193
<v Speaker 3>As you move yourself through the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly evaluating things for </v>

924
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Speaker 3>their motivational significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you do that without thinking.</v>

925
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just how you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

926
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 3>so that's also we're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll return to that many times.</v>

927
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.993
<v Speaker 3>Billy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went downstairs to his tellers </v>

928
00:48:34.901 --> 00:48:35.734
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as a dragon said </v>

929
00:48:37.841 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 3>billy's mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said it like she meant it.</v>

930
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.183
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

931
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.860
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

932
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.370
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're,</v>

933
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.620
<v Speaker 3>you have a three year old child and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the man,</v>

934
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're having a hard time going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sleep cause it's dark and fear of the</v>

935
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 3>dark is actually an emergent phenomena.</v>

936
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.433
<v Speaker 3>So as the child's fear system develops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the child becomes more and more </v>

937
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:00.244
<v Speaker 3>ambulatory and needs to be protected </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the consequences of wandering off </v>

938
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.390
<v Speaker 3>unattended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fiercest does also come online.</v>

939
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:08.523
<v Speaker 3>And what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They populate the darkness with </v>

940
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:11.464
<v Speaker 3>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say you go into your </v>

941
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 3>child's room and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

942
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:16.324
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's a monster in the dark </v>

943
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.491
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

944
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:19.324
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you think really there's no </v>

945
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:26.190
<v Speaker 3>such thing as monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

946
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.033
<v Speaker 3>That's why people are terrified to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>their children walk three blocks to </v>

947
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 3>school because there's no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters.</v>

948
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like there are plenty of monsters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might say,</v>

949
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:40.810
<v Speaker 3>well there aren't monsters like dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I might say,</v>

950
00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 3>well what makes you show so sure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

951
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Why is that a bad classification </v>
<v Speaker 3>heading?</v>

952
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about the class of all</v>

953
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 3>dangerous things that lurk in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness,</v>

954
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.014
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is a good place for the </v>

955
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:55.084
<v Speaker 3>class of all dangerous things to lurk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How better to represent it than in </v>

956
00:49:58.181 --> 00:49:59.014
<v Speaker 3>monstrous forum because the monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 3>form takes pieces from all of the </v>

957
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:06.940
<v Speaker 3>potential dangers and amalgamates them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a single danger and says,</v>

958
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.133
<v Speaker 3>look out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wander into the domains that you don't </v>

959
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 3>understand at your apparel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not fake.</v>

960
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

961
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.243
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and children are small and edible and </v>

962
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 3>they've been that way throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

963
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who children who wandered too far</v>

964
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:28.490
<v Speaker 3>away from the campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get hurt.</v>

965
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that there are dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

966
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 3>there aren't monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good idea.</v>

967
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right approach.</v>

968
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I remember once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this may only seem peripherally related,</v>

969
00:50:41.761 --> 00:50:44.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an integrity related.</v>

970
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 3>One time I remember my daughter when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was about three or there about,</v>

971
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:51.264
<v Speaker 3>she came to talk to my wife and I in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and she said she had a </v>

972
00:50:54.601 --> 00:50:55.434
<v Speaker 3>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the nightmare was she'd seen this </v>

973
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.430
<v Speaker 3>clear stream running through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like an environmentalist fairy</v>

974
00:51:00.431 --> 00:51:01.264
<v Speaker 3>tale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw this clear stream running </v>

975
00:51:02.731 --> 00:51:04.440
<v Speaker 3>through a forest and there was garbage </v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

976
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.450
<v Speaker 3>And when she saw the garbage in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

977
00:51:06.451 --> 00:51:07.284
<v Speaker 3>she was upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she came into our room and she </v>

978
00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:11.730
<v Speaker 3>said that this was upsetting and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>why was their garbage in the stream?</v>

979
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.790
<v Speaker 3>And one response to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

980
00:51:14.791 --> 00:51:16.620
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a dream.</v>

981
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.480
<v Speaker 3>And the other response is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

982
00:51:18.481 --> 00:51:21.150
<v Speaker 3>what would you do if you came upon a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation like that?</v>

983
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.460
<v Speaker 3>And so we asked her that and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

984
00:51:23.461 --> 00:51:25.470
<v Speaker 3>maybe I could take the garbage out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stream.</v>

985
00:51:25.471 --> 00:51:26.281
<v Speaker 3>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

986
00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:28.170
<v Speaker 3>you just close your eyes and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that,</v>

987
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:29.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take the garbage out of the stream </v>

988
00:51:30.361 --> 00:51:31.194
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you go put it in the garbage </v>
<v Speaker 3>can and then that's the end of the </v>

989
00:51:34.141 --> 00:51:35.880
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she was quite happy with that.</v>

990
00:51:35.881 --> 00:51:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And then she wandered off and went back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sleep.</v>

991
00:51:37.621 --> 00:51:38.454
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a better answer than that was </v>

992
00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:42.090
<v Speaker 3>just a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

993
00:51:42.091 --> 00:51:42.924
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't exactly know what you mean </v>

994
00:51:44.011 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 3>when you say that was just a dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

995
00:51:45.861 --> 00:51:47.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you know about dreams?</v>

996
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.063
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

997
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.033
<v Speaker 3>really everything in the world emerges </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a dream and you don't understand </v>

998
00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:55.860
<v Speaker 3>dreams at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to sleep and they happen to you.</v>

999
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.770
<v Speaker 3>You don't control them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're phenomena of nature.</v>

1000
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:01.680
<v Speaker 3>So what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was nothing.</v>

1001
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:02.551
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1002
00:52:02.551 --> 00:52:04.020
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not nothing.</v>

1003
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's her position.</v>

1004
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Billy went downstairs to tell his mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as a dragon,</v>

1005
00:52:09.391 --> 00:52:12.150
<v Speaker 3>said billy's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she said it like she meant it.</v>

1006
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.673
<v Speaker 3>That's a person who does not want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit to the existence of chaos and </v>

1007
00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:20.580
<v Speaker 3>disorder or who wants to protect your </v>
<v Speaker 3>child from that.</v>

1008
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:21.743
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some utility in that because </v>

1009
00:52:23.911 --> 00:52:27.960
<v Speaker 3>there's children have a limited capacity</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with chaos and disorder,</v>

1010
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.730
<v Speaker 3>but to deny its existence in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>presence is the wrong thing to do.</v>

1011
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:33.803
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them the wrong idea about the </v>

1012
00:52:36.091 --> 00:52:38.100
<v Speaker 3>nature of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

1013
00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.053
<v Speaker 3>you're implicitly telling the child that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are certain elements of reality </v>

1014
00:52:42.031 --> 00:52:42.864
<v Speaker 3>that they have that have to be hidden </v>
<v Speaker 3>from them because they're either so </v>

1015
00:52:45.331 --> 00:52:46.164
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming that no one can deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or that the child is so useless </v>

1016
00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:50.244
<v Speaker 3>that the child can't deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the right message to give </v>

1017
00:52:53.731 --> 00:52:57.270
<v Speaker 3>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right message is there are dragons,</v>

1018
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:58.463
<v Speaker 3>but if you're careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can learn how to deal with them and </v>

1019
00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:01.434
<v Speaker 3>we'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Eda pulled mother mistake </v>

1020
00:53:05.281 --> 00:53:06.114
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>

1021
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Kelly went back to his room and began to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dress the dragon came close to billy and</v>

1022
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:19.550
<v Speaker 3>wag its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's looking for attention,</v>

1023
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.384
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something in the household </v>

1024
00:53:21.021 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 3>that's looking for attention and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are ignoring it.</v>

1025
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.913
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't know how many households </v>

1026
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you've walked into where that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>

1027
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1028
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.273
<v Speaker 3>it's endemic among households where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a number of things that are </v>

1029
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 3>demanding attention and no one's paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to them.</v>

1030
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.410
<v Speaker 3>There are things that you don't talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1031
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Are there things that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend not to notice?</v>

1032
00:53:43.561 --> 00:53:44.394
<v Speaker 3>And everyone walks around on eggshells </v>
<v Speaker 3>or on the elephants underneath the </v>

1033
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:48.384
<v Speaker 3>carpet pretending that everything's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and there's nothing that's all </v>

1034
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:51.684
<v Speaker 3>right in the household at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people in this situation like </v>

1035
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 3>that or denying the reality of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>

1036
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 3>not of their own senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if something even deeper than that,</v>

1037
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:01.524
<v Speaker 3>they're denying the reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance that their own nervous </v>

1038
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 3>systems are signaling to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

1039
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 3>It's something's up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's up here.</v>

1040
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Something's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be attended to.</v>

1041
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:11.971
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1042
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 3>everything's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk about that sort of thing.</v>

1043
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that won't make it go away.</v>

1044
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Billy went back to his room and began to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dress the dragon,</v>

1045
00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 3>came close to billy and wagged it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tail.</v>

1046
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.240
<v Speaker 3>But Billy didn't pat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's no such thing as something,</v>

1047
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:31.010
<v Speaker 3>it's silly to patted on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's reasonable proposition.</v>

1048
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Billy washed his face and hands and went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to breakfast.</v>

1049
00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.030
<v Speaker 3>The dragon went along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost,</v>

1050
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.310
<v Speaker 3>it was bigger now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost the size of a dog.</v>

1051
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's interesting.</v>

1052
00:54:44.691 --> 00:54:48.100
<v Speaker 3>So for some reason the dragon is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing now,</v>

1053
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:48.943
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know why it's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's another mystery that's popped </v>

1054
00:54:53.091 --> 00:54:54.950
<v Speaker 3>up in the middle of the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1055
00:54:54.951 --> 00:54:57.380
<v Speaker 3>we might infer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we won't infer anything,</v>

1056
00:54:57.381 --> 00:55:00.500
<v Speaker 3>it's foreshadowing the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragon is growing in the idea there,</v>

1057
00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:01.334
<v Speaker 3>there's something like a hint of an idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if something surprising attracts </v>

1058
00:55:05.031 --> 00:55:07.280
<v Speaker 3>your attention and you don't attend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1059
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.380
<v Speaker 3>then it has the probability of expanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>in size.</v>

1060
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea.</v>

1061
00:55:14.901 --> 00:55:19.901
<v Speaker 3>So I can give you an example of how that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing can occur in your own life</v>

1062
00:55:20.931 --> 00:55:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and how your senses blind you to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality of things.</v>

1063
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:30.710
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you get a bill from the tax</v>
<v Speaker 3>department and they say,</v>

1064
00:55:30.711 --> 00:55:31.544
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you owe us $79 and 47 cents and so you </v>

1065
00:55:34.641 --> 00:55:35.660
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what is that?</v>

1066
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have in front of you,</v>

1067
00:55:39.201 --> 00:55:41.720
<v Speaker 3>a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you crumple it up and you throw it in</v>

1068
00:55:41.721 --> 00:55:42.554
<v Speaker 3>the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then a month later you get </v>

1069
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:50.540
<v Speaker 3>another bill and it's like $95 and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more insistent.</v>

1070
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:54.140
<v Speaker 3>And so you crumple that up and you throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the garbage and you continue to do</v>

1071
00:55:54.141 --> 00:55:54.974
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is that little thing </v>

1072
00:55:55.941 --> 00:55:58.580
<v Speaker 3>that you're ignoring is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggregate</v>

1073
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:04.010
<v Speaker 3>monstrous qualities across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you leave it long enough,</v>

1074
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:05.083
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really going to have to contend </v>

1075
00:56:07.101 --> 00:56:07.934
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it's something that destroys </v>

1076
00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:11.840
<v Speaker 3>your credit history so that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to have a mortgage on your house the</v>

1077
00:56:11.841 --> 00:56:13.400
<v Speaker 3>first time that you tried to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

1078
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you get tangled up with the tax</v>

1079
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:16.664
<v Speaker 3>department and they audit every income </v>
<v Speaker 3>tax return you do for the rest of your </v>

1080
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:22.160
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would make you miserable for about</v>

1081
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.970
<v Speaker 3>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year on a basis for the next 50 years.</v>

1082
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange thing because you know,</v>

1083
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:29.974
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your census seemed to be designed to </v>

1084
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 3>tell you what's immediately relevant in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this immediate space right now,</v>

1085
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 3>here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you see things a certain way,</v>

1086
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:44.281
<v Speaker 3>but they're not really that way and lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things that seem relatively innocuous</v>

1087
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:45.904
<v Speaker 3>from an objective perspective have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capability of manifesting themselves in </v>

1088
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:52.714
<v Speaker 3>magnified proportions across time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do in order to allow to </v>

1089
00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 3>have that happen is just do nothing.</v>

1090
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 3>They'll grow of their own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't attend to them,</v>

1091
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.273
<v Speaker 3>and pretty much all the real problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'll face in your life are going </v>

1092
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.244
<v Speaker 3>to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be things in your </v>

1093
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1094
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:08.974
<v Speaker 3>that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1095
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't really have to attend to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1096
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1097
00:57:12.521 --> 00:57:13.354
<v Speaker 3>don't attend to it once you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>alerted to its existence and see what </v>

1098
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:18.610
<v Speaker 3>happens when that's what this book is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1099
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.800
<v Speaker 3>so it's bigger now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both the size of a dog,</v>

1100
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:23.663
<v Speaker 3>still not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dog you could deal with that </v>

1101
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.420
<v Speaker 3>probably barely sat down at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dragon sat down on the table.</v>

1102
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 3>This sort of thing was not usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>permitted,</v>

1103
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.690
<v Speaker 3>but there wasn't much billy's mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do about it.</v>

1104
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 3>She'd already said there was no such </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as a dragon.</v>

1105
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.073
<v Speaker 3>And if there is no such thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell it to get down off the </v>

1106
00:57:45.031 --> 00:57:45.864
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this scene for a variety of </v>

1107
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:53.140
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons I like it is because</v>

1108
00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.650
<v Speaker 3>if you watch parents with their young </v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1109
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:04.640
<v Speaker 3>one of the places that there's terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict around is eating.</v>

1110
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Many children are somewhat neil phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like new things,</v>

1111
00:58:12.031 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 3>or at least they tell you that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like them.</v>

1112
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And many children are also quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreeable,</v>

1113
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so children vary in their temperament </v>

1114
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:19.703
<v Speaker 3>and there are some children who will do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything they possibly can to please </v>

1115
00:58:22.681 --> 00:58:23.730
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're pretty,</v>

1116
00:58:23.731 --> 00:58:24.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're easy children to take care of </v>

1117
00:58:26.581 --> 00:58:28.440
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have their own sets of problems.</v>

1118
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:29.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there are other children who </v>

1119
00:58:30.661 --> 00:58:33.930
<v Speaker 3>are very disagreeable and there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental proposition.</v>

1120
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.823
<v Speaker 3>Position in life is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that usually emerges at about the </v>

1121
00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:39.420
<v Speaker 3>age of two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1122
00:58:39.421 --> 00:58:42.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's when children discover no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the magic word,</v>

1123
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because parents tell them that please </v>

1124
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:45.660
<v Speaker 3>and thank you are the magic words.</v>

1125
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No is the magic word.</v>

1126
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Because what know is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a test case.</v>

1127
00:58:50.371 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1128
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.313
<v Speaker 3>where do I end and where do you begin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way I discovered that as by you </v>

1129
00:58:55.381 --> 00:58:56.340
<v Speaker 3>asked me something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1130
00:58:56.341 --> 00:58:58.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son was like that.</v>

1131
00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.423
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was hilarious as a two year old </v>

1132
00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:03.690
<v Speaker 3>because like everything you asked him </v>
<v Speaker 3>was no.</v>

1133
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.650
<v Speaker 3>So I'd ask him a bunch of things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew he didn't want to walk,</v>

1134
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.800
<v Speaker 3>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'd say,</v>

1135
00:59:07.801 --> 00:59:08.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1136
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'd say,</v>

1137
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:10.254
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you like some chocolate ice </v>

1138
00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:11.814
<v Speaker 3>cream?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he was really on the road by </v>

1139
00:59:12.781 --> 00:59:14.310
<v Speaker 3>then and he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no.</v>

1140
00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:17.640
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd think about it and realize that,</v>

1141
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just passed up an opportunity for </v>

1142
00:59:19.921 --> 00:59:20.754
<v Speaker 3>chocolate ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was a good trick to play on </v>

1143
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 3>a two year old as far as I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

1144
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1145
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:28.390
<v Speaker 3>but no is a really important word and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1146
00:59:28.391 --> 00:59:29.224
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the place of the battleground </v>

1147
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 3>between the child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Friday and idea in some sense.</v>

1148
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Although Freud identified this conflict </v>
<v Speaker 3>more with toilet training,</v>

1149
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 3>which is also a place where terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflicts can emerge.</v>

1150
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:40.363
<v Speaker 3>I knew a family who had a daughter who </v>
<v Speaker 3>would only use the toilet if she had a </v>

1151
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 3>diaper on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's,</v>

1152
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 3>that's defiant man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1153
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 3>she had full control over her system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no damn way she was going to</v>

1154
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:55.004
<v Speaker 3>do what her mother wanted her to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had to put a diaper on and then she </v>

1155
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 3>would go to the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

1156
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 3>there was like a year's worth of warfare</v>
<v Speaker 3>around that.</v>

1157
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:03.104
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see the same thing at tables </v>

1158
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:08.270
<v Speaker 3>with kids because people have a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard time,</v>

1159
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:09.890
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if it's always been </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

1160
01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:13.400
<v Speaker 3>but modern people have a terrible time </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get their children to eat,</v>

1161
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they're possessed by stupid ideas </v>

1162
01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.211
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1163
01:00:16.211 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 3>the child will eat what's good for them.</v>

1164
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

1165
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 3>why would you expect a two year old to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that?</v>

1166
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:24.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell eats what's good for them?</v>

1167
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like Chocolatey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Claire's had milkshakes for lunch.</v>

1168
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:28.634
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the right thing to do and </v>

1169
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.373
<v Speaker 3>children aren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they'll just eat hot dogs and </v>

1170
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 3>nothing else or maybe hot dogs and kraft</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>

1171
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.473
<v Speaker 3>That's all they ever wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you let your kid get away with </v>

1172
01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:38.144
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what do you do then they're going </v>

1173
01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:41.234
<v Speaker 3>to grow up to be someone who isn't smart</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to enjoy food that's not that </v>

1174
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:45.734
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's about six things in </v>

1175
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>life that are intrinsically pleasurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eating is one of them.</v>

1176
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.223
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can warp them pretty nicely when </v>

1177
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 3>they're little about what they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be allowed to eat and what not.</v>

1178
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:57.344
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deny them a whole lifetime of </v>

1179
01:00:58.761 --> 01:00:59.594
<v Speaker 3>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pleasure that can be involved in </v>

1180
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 3>exploring new foods and eating new </v>
<v Speaker 3>cuisines and all of that.</v>

1181
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.980
<v Speaker 3>But with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with little monster children,</v>

1182
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting their,</v>

1183
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 3>getting their eating habits straight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>no joke.</v>

1184
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be consistency,</v>

1185
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 3>there has to be disciplined and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be orderly timing.</v>

1186
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the kid is also trying to organize</v>

1187
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:19.484
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bodies are trying to organize </v>

1188
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:23.410
<v Speaker 3>themselves with relationship to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1189
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.253
<v Speaker 3>the rhythms of the day with sleeping and</v>
<v Speaker 3>waking and eating and all those things </v>

1190
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:30.410
<v Speaker 3>that are the basic basic elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1191
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.293
<v Speaker 3>of a fundamentally healthy existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And trying to get a child to be in tune </v>

1192
01:01:35.811 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 3>with some sort of stable rhythm for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>children's is extremely difficult.</v>

1193
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I've had clients who's sleeping and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating was chronically disregulated.</v>

1194
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.133
<v Speaker 3>So which basically meant that for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life they never ate properly and </v>

1195
01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 3>they never slept properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never learned how to do it.</v>

1196
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:56.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's partly because this little </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle here never occurred.</v>

1197
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like there is a dragon at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

1198
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.673
<v Speaker 3>That's partly why it's so important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have your family around the table on a </v>

1199
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:03.614
<v Speaker 3>fairly regular basis because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fundamental place where the </v>

1200
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 3>individual meets society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being,</v>

1201
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 3>share food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1202
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:10.814
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There aren't any other animals that do </v>

1203
01:02:12.081 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 3>that except fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 3>from mother to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pop.</v>

1205
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.933
<v Speaker 3>But human beings share food and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really built into our systems at a deep </v>

1206
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:20.930
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1207
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I noticed with my daughter who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was quite agreeable,</v>

1208
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.480
<v Speaker 3>at least when she was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1209
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I used to play tricks on her too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1210
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:30.234
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she was at the table and she was </v>

1211
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 3>about 18 months old or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should have some dessert.</v>

1212
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:38.040
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd ask her if I could have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she'd give it to me right away,</v>

1213
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.320
<v Speaker 3>which of course made me feel horribly </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty.</v>

1214
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like stealing candy from a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like Mr.</v>

1215
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1216
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.233
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she'd handed to me right away and </v>

1217
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:47.754
<v Speaker 3>with a smile on her face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was absolutely </v>

1218
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:50.370
<v Speaker 3>remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1219
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:51.204
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was curious to see that that was </v>

1220
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 3>built in as an instinct at such an early</v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

1221
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 3>By the time she was three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1222
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:57.684
<v Speaker 3>this kid's age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no damn way she's going to hand </v>

1223
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 3>me her dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1224
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:01.254
<v Speaker 3>cause it was at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think somewhere around that point </v>

1225
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1226
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had started to conceptualize </v>

1227
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:07.134
<v Speaker 3>yourself more as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that initial instinct that was a </v>

1228
01:03:10.201 --> 01:03:12.260
<v Speaker 3>sharing instinct had vanished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1229
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 3>then you have to kind of socialize it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back into place.</v>

1230
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of dragons at the table,</v>

1231
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll see that too.</v>

1232
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you go out to restaurants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1233
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:23.784
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a family there with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their two year old or two and a </v>

1234
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 3>half year old.</v>

1235
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is like completely out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1236
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.124
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a cat with a clothes pin on </v>

1237
01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:32.064
<v Speaker 3>its tail running around the cafe or </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant doing nothing but causing </v>

1238
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1239
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.910
<v Speaker 3>the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a client once who,</v>

1240
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.990
<v Speaker 3>who was very immature man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1241
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 3>he had had a child and he wanted to sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1242
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:44.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up a bit and try to be a civilized </v>

1243
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 3>human being and not to screw up this kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>too terribly.</v>

1244
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.034
<v Speaker 3>And he had this dream that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crib for the baby was by the window </v>

1245
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:59.031
<v Speaker 3>and that a bolt of lightening had struck</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the window and let,</v>

1246
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 3>let a ball of lightening go in the House</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was tearing all over the place.</v>

1247
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:04.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought when,</v>

1248
01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.000
<v Speaker 3>when I discussed the dream with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1249
01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:06.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1250
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 3>the dreams telling you about children's </v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1251
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a powerful potential inside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1252
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 3>But unless it's socialized properly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>integrated properly into culture,</v>

1253
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 3>then it can be a terrible destructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>

1254
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

1255
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:20.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's little doubt about that.</v>

1256
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1257
01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter because billy's mother</v>

1258
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 3>has already decided that there's no such</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as a dragon at the table.</v>

1259
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means that when she takes her child</v>

1260
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 3>to a restaurant or to a dinner and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>misbehaves terribly,</v>

1261
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:35.543
<v Speaker 3>that the child will continually </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter nothing but fake smiles and </v>

1262
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.250
<v Speaker 3>disapproval from all the adults that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>

1263
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to be it's destiny for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next number of years.</v>

1264
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.391
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1265
01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do something particularly</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil and vicious to your child,</v>

1266
01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:49.254
<v Speaker 3>then made sure that you fail to inform </v>
<v Speaker 3>them of any of the basic rules of </v>

1267
01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:54.920
<v Speaker 3>civilized behavior so that everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1268
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:55.763
<v Speaker 3>the adults can pretend to tolerate them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then really be pleased when they </v>

1269
01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>leave and never invite them back.</v>

1270
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great destiny.</v>

1271
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.720
<v Speaker 3>So mother made some pancakes for billy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the drag and ate them all,</v>

1272
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.140
<v Speaker 3>mother made some more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the dragon,</v>

1273
01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.930
<v Speaker 3>those two mother kept making pancakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>until she ran out of batter.</v>

1274
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Billy only got one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said that's all he really wanted.</v>

1275
01:05:26.891 --> 01:05:27.724
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you another story about </v>

1276
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:33.910
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I lived in Boston,</v>

1277
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:35.283
<v Speaker 3>I had little kids and my wife took care </v>
<v Speaker 3>of some neighborhood little kids cause </v>

1278
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 3>she didn't have a green card and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1279
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 3>she was home with the kids anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1280
01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 3>she took care of some other little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them would only eat hot dogs.</v>

1281
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:50.200
<v Speaker 3>That was quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd only eat hotdogs that his mother's</v>

1282
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:53.230
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at our house he had all of his lunch</v>

1283
01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>and he was perfectly happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought that was quite amusing too.</v>

1284
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:56.763
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day a neighbor came by and the </v>

1285
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:02.794
<v Speaker 3>neighbor had a four year old child and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the neighbor was looking for someone to </v>

1286
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:07.354
<v Speaker 3>take care of the child because her nanny</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been in a car accident and couldn't </v>

1287
01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:11.224
<v Speaker 3>take care of the child temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the child had sort of been </v>

1288
01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:16.770
<v Speaker 3>circulating around neighborhood houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of days and you know,</v>

1289
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.990
<v Speaker 3>people were taking care of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he ended up at our house and um,</v>

1290
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:22.600
<v Speaker 3>which was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's a cute little guy.</v>

1291
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.853
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1292
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.710
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mother came to the door and she said</v>

1293
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.443
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1294
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.020
<v Speaker 3>push the boy and he was kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1295
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1296
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said he probably won't eat all day,</v>

1297
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:40.030
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

1298
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.273
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1299
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a remarkably interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement to,</v>

1300
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1301
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 3>to put forth as a proposition.</v>

1302
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:52.720
<v Speaker 3>The first time we meet your son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he won't eat all day,</v>

1303
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not okay.</v>

1304
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.233
<v Speaker 3>It's not okay and you're going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>us that it's okay and you're going to </v>

1305
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 3>expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to accept the fact that</v>

1306
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:02.380
<v Speaker 3>you think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1307
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:03.243
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You deliver all that information in one </v>

1308
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 3>little sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

1309
01:07:06.821 --> 01:07:08.990
<v Speaker 3>well that's pretty damn peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1310
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.800
<v Speaker 3>I believe she was a psychologist too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was quite interesting.</v>

1311
01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1312
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:13.894
<v Speaker 3>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went out to do something and there </v>

1313
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:17.554
<v Speaker 3>was four kids playing in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I came back the little guy was in </v>

1314
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:20.914
<v Speaker 3>the porch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wear the boots were at everything </v>

1315
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 3>and he was sort of standing there like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and I thought,</v>

1316
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:26.883
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good because there's all </v>

1317
01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:30.220
<v Speaker 3>these other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he should've been in there playing.</v>

1318
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey that obviously that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a child is prime to do.</v>

1319
01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 3>He should've been in there messing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1320
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:37.504
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a two year old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>three year old and another four year </v>

1321
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.000
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should have beaten there,</v>

1322
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:40.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing trouble and having fun and </v>

1323
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:43.120
<v Speaker 3>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he wasn't,</v>

1324
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 3>he was standing in the porch like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wasn't happy.</v>

1325
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:46.863
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I looked at him for a bit and then I </v>

1326
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 3>poked them a couple of times because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1327
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're interacting with little kids,</v>

1328
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 3>they're very playful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1329
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of like puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you,</v>

1330
01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 3>if you tease them a bit and tickled him </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bath,</v>

1331
01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 3>then usually even if they're crabby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1332
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.253
<v Speaker 3>a smile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a breakout that despite their best </v>

1333
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 3>efforts and then they'll sort of giggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe,</v>

1334
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:07.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll try to whack you away and they,</v>

1335
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:08.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1336
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 3>they go into a play routine.</v>

1337
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And although you may not know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>mammals like us have a place and also,</v>

1338
01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:17.914
<v Speaker 3>so we're intrinsically playful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is partly why we can get along </v>

1339
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:20.684
<v Speaker 3>with dogs because of course dogs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically playful and most people </v>

1340
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 3>know how to play with the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1341
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 3>when a dog wants to play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1342
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:27.524
<v Speaker 3>because it sort of puts his paws down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and looks up at you and sort of grands </v>

1343
01:08:30.451 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 3>and puts its tail in the air and goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Das.</v>

1344
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like clue in primate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1345
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 3>it's time to engage in some playing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 3>you basically know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the dog knows how to do that.</v>

1347
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 3>So I'm poking this kid and trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>him to smile,</v>

1348
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 3>but there's no damn way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm poking him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just ignoring me like mad.</v>

1350
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that's not good.</v>

1351
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.103
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want your four year </v>

1352
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 3>old to have learned that you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>

1353
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.920
<v Speaker 3>That it's okay to ignore adults or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should ignore adults or that you can</v>

1354
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:00.914
<v Speaker 3>ignore adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all bad because the world's full </v>

1355
01:09:03.351 --> 01:09:04.184
<v Speaker 3>of adults and they know a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they control all the resources and </v>

1356
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:08.024
<v Speaker 3>so you better get along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus you're going to end up as an adult </v>

1357
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:14.660
<v Speaker 3>for most of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the general,</v>

1358
01:09:14.661 --> 01:09:15.494
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the first rule is adults can and </v>

1359
01:09:17.901 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 3>should be ignored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what the hell are you headed for?</v>

1360
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.484
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the reasons that it's </v>

1361
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:24.464
<v Speaker 3>really useful to make sure the children </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect adults because they're going to </v>

1362
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:29.960
<v Speaker 3>be adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they don't respect adults,</v>

1363
01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 3>then of course they don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for what they're going to be.</v>

1364
01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Why the hell grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You end up like Peter Pan Because that's</v>

1365
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 3>what Peter Parents about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1366
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Peter Pan Wants to stay at Neverland </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the lost boys where,</v>

1367
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:45.080
<v Speaker 3>where there's no responsibility because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1368
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.003
<v Speaker 3>he looks at the future and only sees his</v>
<v Speaker 3>captain hook a tyrant who's afraid of </v>

1369
01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.600
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the crocodile,</v>

1370
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:51.434
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's chasing him with a clock in its </v>

1371
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.040
<v Speaker 3>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same thing as this dragon.</v>

1372
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids have to respect adults.</v>

1373
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 3>It's you doing them a disservice if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1374
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.311
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1375
01:10:01.311 --> 01:10:02.660
<v Speaker 3>so fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm poking this kid.</v>

1376
01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 3>There's just no damn way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting anywhere with them.</v>

1377
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 3>And I thought this isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something deeply wrong with this</v>

1378
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's fine.</v>

1379
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:10.244
<v Speaker 3>So then we sit all the kids down for </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch and the rule is you're damn lunch </v>

1380
01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 3>and be thankful for it because you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

1381
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:19.184
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leonard Cohen wrote this song once </v>

1382
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:22.580
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the song particularly,</v>

1383
01:10:22.581 --> 01:10:26.060
<v Speaker 3>but he talked about the homicidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitching that goes down in every kitchen</v>

1384
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>about who is going to serve and who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to eat.</v>

1385
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you haven't encountered </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1386
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 3>then there's something terribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1387
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 3>so because a lot of the tension in </v>
<v Speaker 3>households is domestic tension,</v>

1388
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:41.000
<v Speaker 3>the tension between husbands and wives </v>
<v Speaker 3>or husbands,</v>

1389
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:41.834
<v Speaker 3>wives and children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like just who the hell is going to </v>

1390
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:47.780
<v Speaker 3>do the domestic duties and how and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the answer can't be,</v>

1391
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:48.614
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to do them because then </v>

1392
01:10:49.731 --> 01:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat cheetos and popcorn and you know</v>

1393
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of your life and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1394
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:55.904
<v Speaker 3>It's got to the point in England because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domestic situations have </v>

1395
01:10:58.941 --> 01:10:59.774
<v Speaker 3>deteriorated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rituals of deteriorated to such a </v>

1396
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.324
<v Speaker 3>point that about one third at families </v>
<v Speaker 3>no longer have a dining room table and </v>

1397
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 3>you can buy precooked hard boiled eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1398
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1399
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:11.361
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1400
01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good thing and you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1401
01:11:13.681 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 3>why the hell everyone is either fat or </v>
<v Speaker 3>has an eating disorder.</v>

1402
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason is is that the entire</v>

1403
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 3>domestic routine around regulating food </v>
<v Speaker 3>intake has disappeared.</v>

1404
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a terrible thing for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're social eaters.</v>

1405
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1406
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.770
<v Speaker 3>if you sit down with a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people at a table,</v>

1407
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.663
<v Speaker 3>how much should you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is you should eat on </v>

1408
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>average what everyone else eats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what you do.</v>

1409
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1410
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 3>people are so wired into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did experiments like this.</v>

1411
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bring on,</v>

1412
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.013
<v Speaker 3>or if you bring undergraduates who don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know each other into a lab and you give </v>

1413
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:53.910
<v Speaker 3>them a snack while they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like watching a movie,</v>

1414
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 3>they will eat the same number of chips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1415
01:11:57.511 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 3>if one of the meets the whole half the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1416
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 3>the other real you'd have if one only </v>
<v Speaker 3>has one,</v>

1417
01:12:02.431 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 3>the other only have one.</v>

1418
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 3>The correlation between the food intake </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the dyads was about 0.8</v>

1419
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.323
<v Speaker 3>it was staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to be a little higher for </v>

1420
01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:14.010
<v Speaker 3>extroverts than for introverts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was remarkably,</v>

1421
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 3>remarkably can coordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can understand why,</v>

1422
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:17.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because human beings share food.</v>

1423
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:22.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like you are not going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular tribes person if you eat,</v>

1424
01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:23.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30% of the food when food is in short </v>

1425
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 3>supply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better be bloody awake and make sure</v>

1426
01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:29.520
<v Speaker 3>that you don't take more than your </v>
<v Speaker 3>share.</v>

1427
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.593
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fundamental element of human </v>

1428
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.250
<v Speaker 3>nature to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1429
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:39.260
<v Speaker 3>and we also regulate our sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>satiety by cues that are external to us.</v>

1430
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.153
<v Speaker 3>So regulating our food intake also </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're omnivores turns out to be </v>

1431
01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 3>a tremendously difficult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

1432
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to this kid.</v>

1433
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:48.983
<v Speaker 3>So we bring all the kids to the table </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're sitting around in there </v>

1434
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 3>having lunch.</v>

1435
01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And the rule is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

1436
01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.420
<v Speaker 3>eat what is in front of you and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleased and happy about it.</v>

1437
01:13:00.421 --> 01:13:02.580
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why would that also be a rule?</v>

1438
01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:03.414
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1439
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:07.260
<v Speaker 3>put yourself in this position now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll be in this position.</v>

1440
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:12.090
<v Speaker 3>You're going to cook your damn kids some</v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch and you're going to do that.</v>

1441
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's calculate it out.</v>

1442
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Cause I liked doing arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say it takes you half an hour a</v>

1443
01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:18.894
<v Speaker 3>day and you do it seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'll multiply that by three cause </v>

1444
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>there's three meals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an hour and a half a day,</v>

1445
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1446
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.734
<v Speaker 3>okay fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven times an hour and a half has </v>

1447
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 3>roughly 10 so it's 10 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 40 hours a month,</v>

1448
01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:32.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 hours a month is a full work week.</v>

1449
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 3>So 40 hours a month times 1212 full work</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

1450
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:38.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1451
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 3>That's three full months of 40 hour days</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cooking something for your damn kid.</v>

1452
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.113
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're going to do that for 18 </v>

1453
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you might ask yourself,</v>

1454
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.453
<v Speaker 3>what sort of response do you need from </v>
<v Speaker 3>your child in order to not feel </v>

1455
01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:56.664
<v Speaker 3>resentful and miserable about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to do that for three </v>

1456
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:03.300
<v Speaker 3>bloody months this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just have to think about this.</v>

1457
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.313
<v Speaker 3>And this is also why it's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that inside yourself you carry a </v>

1458
01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:08.664
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like the world outside you carries </v>

1459
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:10.884
<v Speaker 3>a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not think that you're going to be </v>

1460
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:13.264
<v Speaker 3>able to maintain a healthy attitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards your child or towards food or </v>

1461
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:17.974
<v Speaker 3>towards yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all you can muster up for the effort </v>

1462
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:21.784
<v Speaker 3>of cooking and preparing food is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude of a slave and continual </v>

1463
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:27.280
<v Speaker 3>punishment from the people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>offering food too.</v>

1464
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell wants that?</v>

1465
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.573
<v Speaker 3>So you want to teach the miserable </v>
<v Speaker 3>little lighter that he's lucky that </v>

1466
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 3>there's any food there at all.</v>

1467
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:35.523
<v Speaker 3>And that the proper attitude is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really thank you very much mom or thank </v>

1468
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:39.334
<v Speaker 3>you very much dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that you produce something and </v>

1469
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.570
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be all happy about the fact that</v>

1470
01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:44.200
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1471
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.840
<v Speaker 3>slaving away in the kitchen and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>like your kid.</v>

1472
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:48.401
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1473
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well everybody likes their kids.</v>

1474
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:50.801
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1475
01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No that's not true.</v>

1476
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.830
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now,</v>

1477
01:14:54.831 --> 01:14:55.331
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 3>you read in the newspaper about someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

1479
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:58.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being pushed a little bit too far on </v>

1480
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:02.950
<v Speaker 3>some day that they're unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hung over and you know,</v>

1481
01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:03.784
<v Speaker 3>the relationship has just broken up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do something absolutely brutal to </v>

1482
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 3>their child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1483
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:08.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could anyone do that?</v>

1484
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:13.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lot of history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible interactions between the mother</v>

1485
01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:14.704
<v Speaker 3>and the child or the father and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>child before something like that </v>

1486
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

1487
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.591
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 3>if you want to protect your child </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the beast that's inside you,</v>

1489
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:21.993
<v Speaker 3>you might want to teach them to treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>you with some respect so that you're </v>

1490
01:15:24.341 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 3>much more likely to be a civilized human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being around them.</v>

1491
01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1492
01:15:28.961 --> 01:15:31.600
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this kid sitting there and there's no</v>

1493
01:15:31.601 --> 01:15:33.350
<v Speaker 3>damn way he's going to eat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1494
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So we decided we're going to feed him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm an expert at because my,</v>

1495
01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.910
<v Speaker 3>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one who said no all the time,</v>

1496
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:42.790
<v Speaker 3>he was the most stubborn little cus you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could possibly imagine.</v>

1497
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:45.280
<v Speaker 3>And one time when he was about nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months old,</v>

1498
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 3>he got ahold of the spoon and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was not going to be fed anymore.</v>

1499
01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's fine.</v>

1500
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:50.591
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1501
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:51.424
<v Speaker 3>it's like feed yourself but no kids a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're too damn curious and playful </v>

1502
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 3>really to feed themselves.</v>

1503
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.540
<v Speaker 3>So you sit them in a high chair and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they fleeing the food onto the floor </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that's pretty cool.</v>

1505
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.340
<v Speaker 3>And they could watch that over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1506
01:16:03.341 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>or they mess around with it or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1507
01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put some in Mum's hair cause that's </v>

1508
01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:08.434
<v Speaker 3>interesting to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have two or three bites and then </v>

1509
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:12.520
<v Speaker 3>they're not ravenous and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more interested in playing.</v>

1510
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:13.803
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine except that if the kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>does need then it gets crabby and you </v>

1511
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:18.124
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whiny and miserable and then it just </v>

1512
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 3>disturbs the mother or the father and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it won't sleep at night.</v>

1513
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after about three days of that,</v>

1514
01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:26.584
<v Speaker 3>I took the spoon back from him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was not happy about that man trying to </v>

1515
01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 3>get that little kid to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I got the spoon,</v>

1516
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 3>it was like a four hour battle.</v>

1517
01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.270
<v Speaker 3>It was really remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1518
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.333
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of respect for his ability </v>

1519
01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:42.070
<v Speaker 3>just to withstand stubbornness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1520
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:45.730
<v Speaker 3>But I'd learned by that time as a parent</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like if you want to discipline your</v>

1521
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1522
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:50.380
<v Speaker 3>there's an attitude you have to take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I am going to win this.</v>

1523
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't care how stubborn you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to win.</v>

1524
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>And because I know I'm going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get angry.</v>

1525
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:00.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to out stubborn you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1526
01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:04.510
<v Speaker 3>so I take up some food and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of him.</v>

1527
01:17:04.511 --> 01:17:08.350
<v Speaker 3>He go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was a good trick.</v>

1528
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:10.870
<v Speaker 3>And so I tried get the food in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his teeth regretted.</v>

1529
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 3>So I poke him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1530
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:14.541
<v Speaker 3>poke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poke,</v>

1531
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:15.021
<v Speaker 3>poke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poke.</v>

1532
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:15.854
<v Speaker 3>And after about 10 pokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd get annoyed and go and I put the </v>

1533
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:18.850
<v Speaker 3>food yet.</v>

1534
01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:20.890
<v Speaker 3>And then he tried to spit it out so I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold it.</v>

1535
01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 3>He had in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>

1536
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 3>so that was like three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1537
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:25.140
<v Speaker 3>and then we did it with another </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoonful.</v>

1538
01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.420
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after about,</v>

1539
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I'd say an hour of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife had to leave because it was like</v>

1540
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 3>she just couldn't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And about an hour after this,</v>

1541
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:33.430
<v Speaker 3>he decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1542
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.960
<v Speaker 3>it was okayed and that he would let me </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed them.</v>

1543
01:17:35.961 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 3>But like it was brutal and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1544
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little kids are so damn tough,</v>

1545
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really cute and everything and,</v>

1546
01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>but they're so tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't believe it.</v>

1547
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:46.844
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we had this good at the table and he </v>

1548
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:53.600
<v Speaker 3>was not going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my wife who'd learned these tricks by</v>

1549
01:17:53.601 --> 01:17:56.390
<v Speaker 3>this time decided to feed him and he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

1550
01:17:56.530 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 3>sort of nine month old or eight month </v>
<v Speaker 3>old behaviors because you know,</v>

1551
01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:01.274
<v Speaker 3>kids have different strategies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance if they don't want to do </v>

1552
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1553
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 3>And those strategies get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated as they get older.</v>

1554
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.810
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had some strategies,</v>

1555
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:10.760
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1556
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.190
<v Speaker 3>like he didn't make jokes or knock this </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoon way or,</v>

1557
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 3>or get angry or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or run away or any of those things.</v>

1558
01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:17.234
<v Speaker 3>He did kind of nine month old things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means he just put his head down </v>

1559
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.773
<v Speaker 3>and when she put the spoon towards him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just avert his head one way or </v>

1560
01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1561
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.753
<v Speaker 3>So that was interesting because I knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his parents had given up feeding </v>

1562
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:32.060
<v Speaker 3>him when he was about eight or nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months old because those tricks worked.</v>

1563
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why she could come to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and saying,</v>

1564
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:36.170
<v Speaker 3>he probably won't eat all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's all right.</v>

1565
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1566
01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:40.880
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So find,</v>

1567
01:18:40.881 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 3>so my wife is trying to feed him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't open his mouth,</v>

1568
01:18:43.401 --> 01:18:45.960
<v Speaker 3>so she pokes from Tibet and sooner or </v>
<v Speaker 3>later he gets mad and you know,</v>

1569
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 3>goes ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she puts the food in and she does.</v>

1570
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 3>And then she pats him on the head as </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as he swallows it and says,</v>

1571
01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being a really good kid.</v>

1572
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a good job.</v>

1573
01:18:54.441 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's wondering what the Hell is going</v>

1574
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:57.944
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was so interesting because </v>

1575
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:02.030
<v Speaker 3>she kept feeding him and he was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

1576
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.013
<v Speaker 3>but as she patted him on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be doing this and he'd open his </v>

1577
01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:06.554
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like there was this weird </v>

1578
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:08.594
<v Speaker 3>conflict between his habitual behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this thing that was being </v>

1579
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:12.750
<v Speaker 3>reinforced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then she'd,</v>

1580
01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put food in and pat him and he,</v>

1581
01:19:15.021 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be kind of happy about that.</v>

1582
01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd go back to his routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she did that for,</v>

1583
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.093
<v Speaker 3>I think about 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't disruptive like all the other </v>

1584
01:19:23.841 --> 01:19:24.674
<v Speaker 3>kids ate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even really notice what was </v>

1585
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1586
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a big deal,</v>

1587
01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:28.394
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was watching because I knew </v>

1588
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:32.690
<v Speaker 3>something was up because the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that his mother said,</v>

1589
01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 3>and then the fact that he wouldn't play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he ignored me.</v>

1590
01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:35.790
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1591
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.310
<v Speaker 3>there's some reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not good here.</v>

1592
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 3>There's dragon here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a big one.</v>

1593
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 3>So she feeds him and then he finishes </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole bull.</v>

1594
01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:46.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she says,</v>

1595
01:19:46.611 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you're a good boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ate the whole bull and Jesus,</v>

1596
01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.510
<v Speaker 3>you should have seen what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid.</v>

1597
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just about broke my heart.</v>

1598
01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:52.784
<v Speaker 3>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like his eyes got big and he smiled and </v>

1599
01:19:55.461 --> 01:19:56.294
<v Speaker 3>he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was super thrilled because he'd </v>

1600
01:19:58.690 --> 01:19:59.523
<v Speaker 3>finally accomplished this absolute basic</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity that he hadn't mastered in </v>

1601
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He finally got it right and you think of</v>

1602
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:07.973
<v Speaker 3>of meals that he went through either </v>
<v Speaker 3>being ignored or failing three times a </v>

1603
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:12.990
<v Speaker 3>day for like three years.</v>

1604
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but failure and bad responses </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1605
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.603
<v Speaker 3>he didn't turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized all that he thought he was a </v>

1606
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>bad kid and then all of a sudden post he</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured this out and you know,</v>

1607
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:22.914
<v Speaker 3>get a little reward for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like he just lit up and that </v>

1608
01:20:24.841 --> 01:20:25.674
<v Speaker 3>whole shell that he had on that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like using to protect himself when he </v>

1609
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>was in the porch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just melted away.</v>

1610
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.233
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was horrifying and amazing at the </v>

1611
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:36.444
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he followed my wife around </v>

1612
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 3>after that in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a puppy dog.</v>

1613
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Like he wouldn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would not get more than one foot away</v>

1614
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 3>from her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was unbelievable.</v>

1615
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:47.154
<v Speaker 3>And then we went downstairs to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a movie with the kids and she sat </v>

1616
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:51.084
<v Speaker 3>on a rocking chair and he climbed right </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on her lap and grabbed her just like </v>

1617
01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:53.430
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1618
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Harlow monkey grabbed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1619
01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:58.140
<v Speaker 3>the little soft mother instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wire.</v>

1620
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:02.160
<v Speaker 3>He mother pm's like this and he was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for like two hours.</v>

1621
01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:06.150
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't let her go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the mother came home,</v>

1622
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.373
<v Speaker 3>his mother came home and she came </v>
<v Speaker 3>downstairs and she looked at what was </v>

1623
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:11.131
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:15.510
<v Speaker 3>and this kid was like glommed onto my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife and she looked at her and she said,</v>

1625
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:16.500
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supermom.</v>

1626
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took her kid and went home.</v>

1627
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:21.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you don't think there's a dragon</v>

1628
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 3>and that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1629
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:24.930
<v Speaker 3>you are not listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not good.</v>

1630
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 3>And her response at the end was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

1631
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 3>She should have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1632
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:32.370
<v Speaker 3>how'd you get them to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1633
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:33.960
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell is he doing?</v>

1634
01:21:33.961 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Like hugging you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never does that to me.</v>

1635
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 3>No Way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1636
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.453
<v Speaker 3>She was going to let that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information in and it's no wonder </v>

1637
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:41.874
<v Speaker 3>because the dragon and that story was </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and it was something she did not </v>

1638
01:21:45.181 --> 01:21:49.800
<v Speaker 3>want to admit and she was willing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly willing to sacrifice her child</v>

1639
01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 3>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to her failure to realize that she could</v>

1640
01:21:52.201 --> 01:21:53.034
<v Speaker 3>be a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that meant that the child was the </v>

1641
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:58.200
<v Speaker 3>problem and that's a hell of a thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do to a four year old.</v>

1642
01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 3>So it was not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really not pleasant.</v>

1643
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:05.503
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we probably did damage to the child by </v>

1644
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.390
<v Speaker 3>actually getting them to do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1645
01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.224
<v Speaker 3>A because we opened up him up to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that he could behave </v>

1646
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:17.610
<v Speaker 3>properly and be rewarded for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that gave them hope.</v>

1647
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.433
<v Speaker 3>And so you can bloody well be sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hope was dispensed with the next </v>

1648
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:23.423
<v Speaker 3>day</v>

1649
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.473
<v Speaker 2>salt.</v>

1650
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:27.980
<v Speaker 3>And that's why billy doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to eat.</v>

1651
01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.533
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1652
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.673
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd still do it because you know the </v>

1653
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:48.924
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the child got to learn that </v>

1654
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 3>there was adult somewhere in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would pay attention to them.</v>

1655
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

1656
01:22:57.690 --> 01:22:58.441
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1657
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.970
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1658
01:22:59.971 --> 01:23:03.030
<v Speaker 3>you can't let things that aren't right </v>
<v Speaker 3>or occur under your,</v>

1659
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 3>under your supervision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1660
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:06.783
<v Speaker 3>it's not appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should pay attention to little </v>

1661
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1662
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.120
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're remarkable little things and you</v>

1663
01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they there,</v>

1664
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:19.420
<v Speaker 3>if you pay attention to your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never have better companions.</v>

1665
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:20.561
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

1666
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:22.990
<v Speaker 3>they're remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really easy to get along with.</v>

1667
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Unless they're hungry or tired or hot or</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>

1668
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:26.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like you should be able to deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

1669
01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Writes for things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1670
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 3>is he hot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He called his,</v>

1671
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 3>he hungry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1672
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 3>does he have to go to the bathroom?</v>

1673
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1674
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you take them,</v>

1675
01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:38.020
<v Speaker 3>they're happy until they get tired or </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot or cold or hungry.</v>

1676
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 3>And by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably one of those things.</v>

1677
01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:41.434
<v Speaker 3>But you're too stupid to notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the kid will notice first and then </v>

1678
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's fun.</v>

1679
01:23:45.431 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 3>And the kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like little,</v>

1680
01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any latent inhibition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technically,</v>

1681
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I think is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're around little kids,</v>

1682
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 3>you know you're no longer cynical </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they still see the world and you</v>

1683
01:23:57.431 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Speaker 3>can't because you're old and stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blind and you know the kid can still see</v>

1684
01:24:01.121 --> 01:24:03.010
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you take the kids around,</v>

1685
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.640
<v Speaker 3>you can see the world again because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can see it through their eyes and that's</v>

1686
01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:09.100
<v Speaker 3>such a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just unbelievable.</v>

1687
01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to mess with that and you</v>

1688
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:12.484
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for deciding that the kid </v>

1689
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:17.320
<v Speaker 3>happens to be the monster that you won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>admit you are.</v>

1690
01:24:17.321 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 3>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a monster.</v>

1691
01:24:19.151 --> 01:24:19.984
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is only do you know it and </v>

1692
01:24:23.501 --> 01:24:26.080
<v Speaker 3>are you going to do something about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you think that's wrong,</v>

1693
01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:27.370
<v Speaker 3>then well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1694
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.110
<v Speaker 3>good luck to you.</v>

1695
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Belly went upstairs to brush his teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mothers started clearing the table.</v>

1696
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Speaker 3>The dragon who is quite as big as </v>
<v Speaker 3>mothered by this time,</v>

1697
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 3>that's not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1698
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Made himself comfortable on the hall rug</v>
<v Speaker 3>and went to sleep.</v>

1699
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.430
<v Speaker 3>So now she's ignored something for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long that it's basically her size.</v>

1700
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:53.803
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people in therapy talking </v>

1701
01:24:56.991 --> 01:25:00.260
<v Speaker 3>about their marriages when they're sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of on the verge of divorce,</v>

1702
01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1703
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:04.813
<v Speaker 3>they have dragons that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the person brings with them that </v>

1704
01:25:08.841 --> 01:25:09.674
<v Speaker 3>are their size or bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that means in some sense is </v>

1705
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:13.274
<v Speaker 3>that they've ignored certain things for </v>
<v Speaker 3>so long that the problem has become so </v>

1706
01:25:16.461 --> 01:25:17.294
<v Speaker 3>complex and multifaceted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>multi-headed that they no longer have </v>

1707
01:25:19.911 --> 01:25:22.820
<v Speaker 3>the energy or the ability to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1708
01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to calculate at certain times </v>

1709
01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:28.130
<v Speaker 3>how many decisions that you make during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day,</v>

1710
01:25:28.131 --> 01:25:29.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're going to react one way or</v>

1711
01:25:29.871 --> 01:25:32.810
<v Speaker 3>another and maybe you're doing that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the context of a relationship.</v>

1712
01:25:32.811 --> 01:25:33.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1713
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.753
<v Speaker 3>most of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've had a relationship of any </v>

1714
01:25:36.051 --> 01:25:36.771
<v Speaker 3>length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1715
01:25:36.771 --> 01:25:37.604
<v Speaker 3>more than a couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to actually interact with the </v>

1716
01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 3>person rather than your idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1717
01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:44.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are conflicts and part of them are</v>

1718
01:25:44.451 --> 01:25:47.660
<v Speaker 3>because you're both stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotic and ignorant and half crazy.</v>

1719
01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.493
<v Speaker 3>And some of them are because life has </v>
<v Speaker 3>real problems and there's really </v>

1720
01:25:51.441 --> 01:25:54.680
<v Speaker 3>difficult things like conflicts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest that have to be worked out.</v>

1721
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:55.723
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard and you know you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each interaction that you have </v>

1722
01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:00.284
<v Speaker 3>within a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically decide whether you're </v>

1723
01:26:01.881 --> 01:26:02.714
<v Speaker 3>going to address the reality that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you or whether you're going to </v>

1724
01:26:06.321 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 3>let it slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1725
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:09.704
<v Speaker 3>if you let 10 or 20 things slide a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are all things that would in </v>

1726
01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:19.030
<v Speaker 3>principle have to be addressed in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep the relationship pristine and,</v>

1727
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 3>and functional and adapted to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>current situation.</v>

1728
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:22.963
<v Speaker 3>You let 20 things like that slide a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like 150 a week or 600 a month or </v>

1729
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 3>7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year and you do that for 10 years,</v>

1730
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 3>then it's 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you haven't dealt with.</v>

1731
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>And so then you go to therapy and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1732
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:36.170
<v Speaker 3>our marriage isn't so good.</v>

1733
01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:37.820
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look behind it,</v>

1734
01:26:37.821 --> 01:26:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh there's 75,000</v>

1735
01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 3>problems that you haven't solved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like good luck starting now.</v>

1736
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:44.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't do it.</v>

1737
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 3>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's no way out divorced.</v>

1738
01:26:47.991 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you have children.</v>

1739
01:26:50.961 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like you might as well have </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminal cancer.</v>

1740
01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.073
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting divorced with children is no </v>

1741
01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.144
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen people's lives absolutely </v>

1742
01:26:57.981 --> 01:27:01.580
<v Speaker 3>demolished by that so that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 3>hope they could recover.</v>

1743
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:04.730
<v Speaker 3>It's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes it works and the people</v>

1744
01:27:04.731 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1745
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>they can communicate enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable about the,</v>

1746
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:12.290
<v Speaker 3>about the distribution of assets and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the children's custody.</v>

1747
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're not reasonable,</v>

1748
01:27:14.361 --> 01:27:15.200
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

1749
01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:16.034
<v Speaker 3>it's just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't generate problems around </v>

1750
01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:20.564
<v Speaker 3>yourself by avoiding unnecessary things </v>
<v Speaker 3>until the problem is so big that it's </v>

1751
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 3>bigger than you because you're basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>done at that point.</v>

1752
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.180
<v Speaker 3>You can't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have the energy.</v>

1753
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 3>So you can tell when a couples like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1754
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:36.830
<v Speaker 3>because they keep bringing up things </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the past like 20 year ago,</v>

1755
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:37.840
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1756
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:39.700
<v Speaker 3>he's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1757
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've always been like that.</v>

1758
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.433
<v Speaker 3>You're like that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll always be like that in the </v>

1759
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:44.834
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's no way to begin to </v>

1760
01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:48.470
<v Speaker 3>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can remember something that</v>

1761
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>happened 20 years ago and bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1762
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.180
<v Speaker 3>that'll make you happy.</v>

1763
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:59.400
<v Speaker 3>By the time billy came back downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dragon had grown so much.</v>

1764
01:27:59.401 --> 01:28:00.234
<v Speaker 3>He filled the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy only had to go around by way of </v>

1765
01:28:02.521 --> 01:28:04.350
<v Speaker 3>the living room to get to where his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother was.</v>

1766
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know dragons grew so fast at </v>
<v Speaker 3>billy.</v>

1767
01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.700
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said mother firmly.</v>

1768
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:14.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1769
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.110
<v Speaker 3>cleaning the downstairs took mother all </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

1770
01:28:21.111 --> 01:28:21.944
<v Speaker 3>What was the dragon in the way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And having to climb in and out of </v>

1771
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:24.254
<v Speaker 3>windows to get from room to room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a really funny one day </v>

1772
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:27.614
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so obvious now that there's </v>

1773
01:28:29.271 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 3>something up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's still not going to admit it.</v>

1774
01:28:31.161 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1775
01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:33.613
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in places like that to where </v>

1776
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:37.363
<v Speaker 3>there's so much interpersonal tension </v>
<v Speaker 3>among the participants and so many </v>

1777
01:28:40.251 --> 01:28:41.084
<v Speaker 3>pathological things going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>household that nothing simple can get </v>

1778
01:28:44.751 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1779
01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:46.784
<v Speaker 3>So like maybe that the job of making a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuna sandwich takes like two hours </v>

1780
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but first of all,</v>

1781
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:55.250
<v Speaker 3>nobody can find anything to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1782
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.263
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fridge is empty and maybe the tuna </v>

1783
01:28:57.381 --> 01:29:00.500
<v Speaker 3>cans or six years old and the breads all</v>
<v Speaker 3>moldy and stale.</v>

1784
01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:01.334
<v Speaker 3>And then even if that wasn't the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't figure out who the hell is </v>

1785
01:29:03.901 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 3>going to go shopping.</v>

1786
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And then even if they could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be big fight around,</v>

1787
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should be on the sandwich and how </v>

1788
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:11.300
<v Speaker 3>much tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

1789
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>the point of this little part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story is that,</v>

1790
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a simple task is only a simple task.</v>

1791
01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:21.690
<v Speaker 3>If there aren't all sorts of impediments</v>
<v Speaker 3>around cluttering it up,</v>

1792
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1793
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:23.634
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if there are impediments like that </v>

1794
01:29:24.871 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 3>cluttering it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you just can't get it done.</v>

1795
01:29:26.881 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And then you can see why that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly stressful.</v>

1796
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:30.504
<v Speaker 3>Because what it means in part is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no way that you can just do </v>

1797
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:34.164
<v Speaker 3>something straight forward with ease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is about everything all the </v>

1798
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:38.520
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1799
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

1800
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very,</v>

1801
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:42.144
<v Speaker 3>very common.</v>

1802
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see couples all the time.</v>

1803
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:48.300
<v Speaker 3>This is a modern problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1804
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.293
<v Speaker 3>one of the advantages to traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>divisions of labor is that everybody </v>

1805
01:29:55.651 --> 01:29:57.660
<v Speaker 3>knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>

1806
01:29:57.661 --> 01:29:58.950
<v Speaker 3>well that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1807
01:29:58.951 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay fine.</v>

1808
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably true.</v>

1809
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 3>The question is what the hell is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative?</v>

1810
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:10.530
<v Speaker 3>And the alternative is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiate every single task.</v>

1811
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to habit with someone at</v>

1812
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.020
<v Speaker 3>some point in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's your options.</v>

1813
01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny or negotiation.</v>

1814
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:22.013
<v Speaker 3>So you can be the slave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be the tyrant or you can </v>

1815
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:24.564
<v Speaker 3>negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is in the absence of </v>

1816
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 3>routine and ritual and tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no rules.</v>

1817
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.250
<v Speaker 3>So everything has to be negotiated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is most people</v>

1818
01:30:35.251 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 3>can't negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how,</v>

1819
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the negotiation,</v>

1820
01:30:39.931 --> 01:30:43.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a complex process and people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very unlikely to engage in it.</v>

1821
01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:43.883
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm trying to get people to make </v>

1822
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

1823
01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:48.990
<v Speaker 3>when they have to deal with something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very complicated,</v>

1824
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:51.090
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do is I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1825
01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:51.471
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1826
01:30:51.471 --> 01:30:53.580
<v Speaker 3>let's lay out the problem space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1827
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:57.660
<v Speaker 3>all we're going to do is discuss what </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be going on here.</v>

1828
01:30:57.661 --> 01:30:58.494
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to jump to any </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusions about whether any of these </v>

1829
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:03.390
<v Speaker 3>theories are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to contemplate them.</v>

1830
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.613
<v Speaker 3>And right away there's resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because it's very difficult for </v>

1831
01:31:06.841 --> 01:31:11.841
<v Speaker 3>people to separate a hypothesis about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way things are from a description of</v>

1832
01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:16.134
<v Speaker 3>the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get afraid that as soon as you </v>

1833
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:21.840
<v Speaker 3>discuss something in a certain way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way it's going to be.</v>

1834
01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>And so they can't even lay out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem space.</v>

1835
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:27.360
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first impediment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiation.</v>

1836
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 3>And then another impediment is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1837
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.780
<v Speaker 3>they can define what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1838
01:31:33.781 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 3>so like if you and I are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiate about something,</v>

1839
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:39.660
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you need to know is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I could do that would satisfy you.</v>

1840
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 3>And if the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1841
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:44.430
<v Speaker 3>if you knew me better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd know what would satisfy me.</v>

1842
01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Which is a very common answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm,</v>

1843
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm hatched right from the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like I'm stupid.</v>

1844
01:31:49.441 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what will satisfy you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what will satisfy me.</v>

1845
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to tell me,</v>

1846
01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm not very bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1847
01:31:56.071 --> 01:31:57.750
<v Speaker 3>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know.</v>

1848
01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:58.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1849
01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1850
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have two problems.</v>

1851
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 3>The problem and whatever would make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

1852
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>

1853
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:08.350
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to lay out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution space.</v>

1854
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:08.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1855
01:32:08.771 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 3>We could do it this way or we could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it this way or we could do it this way,</v>

1856
01:32:11.411 --> 01:32:13.400
<v Speaker 3>or here's another option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or this is an option.</v>

1857
01:32:13.401 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 3>And like why don't you think those </v>
<v Speaker 3>through?</v>

1858
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:16.294
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1859
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.340
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole set of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>realities.</v>

1860
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:19.570
<v Speaker 3>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1861
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:21.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of this discussion.</v>

1862
01:32:21.881 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1863
01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:27.803
<v Speaker 3>so there's a dragon in everyone's house </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that size now because no one knows </v>

1864
01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:34.290
<v Speaker 3>what to do and no one knows how to solve</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem of what to do because people</v>

1865
01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:36.840
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just aren't good at it.</v>

1866
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.450
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1867
01:32:39.451 --> 01:32:44.451
<v Speaker 3>cause you have to suspend your judgment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to have a symbolic war that</v>

1868
01:32:45.751 --> 01:32:46.584
<v Speaker 3>doesn't erupt into a real war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to solve it and then </v>

1869
01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:54.000
<v Speaker 3>people have to agree to the solution and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have to enact a solution,</v>

1870
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:54.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to be,</v>

1871
01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.360
<v Speaker 3>they have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to what?</v>

1872
01:32:57.390 --> 01:33:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Act Out their word once the solution has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been negotiated and it happens,</v>

1873
01:33:03.721 --> 01:33:06.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people avoid it all the time and then</v>

1874
01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:08.400
<v Speaker 3>everything becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

1875
01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I went to her house once quite regularly</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the husband refused to,</v>

1876
01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.580
<v Speaker 3>he was kind of a traditionalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:22.440
<v Speaker 3>and he refused to ever thank his wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>for doing anything that was domestically</v>

1878
01:33:22.441 --> 01:33:23.580
<v Speaker 3>related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cooking now.</v>

1879
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:25.350
<v Speaker 3>And she also had a career and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1880
01:33:25.351 --> 01:33:26.184
<v Speaker 3>a pretty demanding careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't self evident that she </v>

1881
01:33:28.261 --> 01:33:31.230
<v Speaker 3>should be the one that was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't matter.</v>

1882
01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.093
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1883
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 3>she could cook but she wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so every time I went there,</v>

1884
01:33:36.671 --> 01:33:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I had the most God awful food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just staggeringly terrible.</v>

1885
01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:41.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything had done,</v>

1886
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:42.124
<v Speaker 3>been done to that food to torture it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that add intelligent and irritated </v>

1887
01:33:45.551 --> 01:33:46.384
<v Speaker 3>person could possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the price that was being paid in </v>

1888
01:33:48.941 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 3>that and the kids would neat and it's No</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn wonder.</v>

1889
01:33:51.341 --> 01:33:52.720
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like who would eat that?</v>

1890
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:53.973
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the price the family was paying </v>

1891
01:33:55.391 --> 01:34:00.391
<v Speaker 3>for not negotiating around this complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>operation because running a domestic,</v>

1892
01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.310
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Economy is very complex operation.</v>

1893
01:34:03.311 --> 01:34:04.144
<v Speaker 3>The price they paid for it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single meal was like curdled with </v>

1894
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:11.890
<v Speaker 3>resentment and the food quality was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible and everyone was angry.</v>

1895
01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1896
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 3>that's like four hours a day of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1897
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 3>that's like a quarter of your waking </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1898
01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1899
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.323
<v Speaker 3>after engaging in that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction with your husband or your </v>

1900
01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:27.220
<v Speaker 3>wife for like a quarter of the day for </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>

1901
01:34:27.221 --> 01:34:28.054
<v Speaker 3>you can be sure that whatever goodwill </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might have stored up is pretty much </v>

1902
01:34:30.821 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 3>evaporated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1903
01:34:32.351 --> 01:34:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that you might think about,</v>

1904
01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:36.480
<v Speaker 3>and this is counter intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1905
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 3>because people think what are the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important events in your life?</v>

1906
01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.430
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one is going to say breakfast.</v>

1907
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1908
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:45.450
<v Speaker 3>well I went to Europe for two weeks this</v>
<v Speaker 3>summer,</v>

1909
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.560
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all that stuff's irrelevant.</v>

1910
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exceptions are irrelevant.</v>

1911
01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Your life is made up of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do every day.</v>

1912
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's made up of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1913
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:57.304
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how many thousands of hours </v>

1914
01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 3>you're going to spend having breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the,</v>

1915
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:01.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the course of your life.</v>

1916
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:04.610
<v Speaker 3>But it's going to be something like one </v>
<v Speaker 3>16th of the time you have left.</v>

1917
01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you've got eight years </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1918
01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:07.953
<v Speaker 3>that means you're gonna have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have spent five years </v>

1919
01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 3>having breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like get it right.</v>

1920
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.903
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause about I would say about half of </v>

1921
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 3>your life is routine and if you get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>routines right,</v>

1922
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:20.414
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody sits down and meals real </v>

1923
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:22.544
<v Speaker 3>good and everybody's happy about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the little decisions have been </v>

1924
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 3>distributed property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Poof,</v>

1925
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.073
<v Speaker 3>half your life is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know and you won't get sat and </v>

1926
01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 3>have an eating disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also,</v>

1927
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.093
<v Speaker 3>it's also kind of a plus or you won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get as fat or have as much of an eating </v>

1928
01:35:37.851 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 3>disorder by noon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dragon filled doubts,</v>

1929
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:42.743
<v Speaker 3>it's head hung out the front door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tail hung out the back door and </v>

1930
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:46.424
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a room in the house that </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have some part of the dragon in </v>

1931
01:35:48.231 --> 01:35:49.064
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1932
01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet that there is a house like that on</v>

1933
01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 3>some of you will live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where there's a lot of houses,</v>

1934
01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 3>somebody live in apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter.</v>

1935
01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:00.020
<v Speaker 3>But I bet you if you live in a house on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a block of houses,</v>

1936
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.093
<v Speaker 3>there's at least one house on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>street where the tail of the dragon has </v>

1937
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:06.980
<v Speaker 3>started to come out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>

1938
01:36:06.981 --> 01:36:07.814
<v Speaker 3>that's like gay because it's the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't really want to look at </v>

1939
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:11.240
<v Speaker 3>when you walk by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1940
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:12.400
<v Speaker 3>and maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1941
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:13.243
<v Speaker 3>that needs a new roof and like the doors</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit crooked and the law and </v>

1942
01:36:15.861 --> 01:36:17.210
<v Speaker 3>isn't cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1943
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:18.044
<v Speaker 3>there's some rusty things lying around </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and like it's just not taken care </v>

1944
01:36:21.441 --> 01:36:22.670
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1945
01:36:22.671 --> 01:36:24.800
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you know from the gossip in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood too,</v>

1946
01:36:24.801 --> 01:36:28.610
<v Speaker 3>that there's something going on in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>house that is just not good and it's got</v>

1947
01:36:28.611 --> 01:36:29.444
<v Speaker 3>to the point where it's so not good that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's starting to spread itself out </v>

1948
01:36:33.111 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 3>beyond the domestic confines of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1949
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:37.460
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you love,</v>

1950
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you run into people like that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then too,</v>

1951
01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:41.330
<v Speaker 3>you'll notice this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1952
01:36:41.331 --> 01:36:43.150
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this has happened to him</v>

1953
01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.013
<v Speaker 3>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might have tapped you in some </v>

1954
01:36:45.711 --> 01:36:46.750
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that there,</v>

1955
01:36:46.751 --> 01:36:47.584
<v Speaker 3>there was people who can't not tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about what's going on in </v>

1956
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you've hardly even met them.</v>

1957
01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:55.010
<v Speaker 3>If you see someone who's really in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>

1958
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.083
<v Speaker 3>you know you'll sit on the bus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's clearly on the road to </v>

1959
01:37:00.411 --> 01:37:01.244
<v Speaker 3>being thoroughly de deranged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll sit down beside you and they'll </v>

1960
01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:05.780
<v Speaker 3>start telling you about the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>

1961
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.823
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that the dragon that they're </v>

1962
01:37:07.851 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 3>dealing with is so big that they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even contain it.</v>

1963
01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:15.340
<v Speaker 3>There are so desperate to have it dealt </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that they can't not talk about it.</v>

1964
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:16.460
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1965
01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 3>And there's lots of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones,</v>

1966
01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 3>what is that stupid little phrase?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tmi.</v>

1967
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much information.</v>

1968
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.081
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1969
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:24.914
<v Speaker 3>well why does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because people are dealing with </v>

1970
01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:28.154
<v Speaker 3>anomalies and unexpected occurrences and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedies and they cannot articulate a </v>

1971
01:37:32.121 --> 01:37:35.600
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people think by talking,</v>

1972
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 3>which is also part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy works.</v>

1973
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:42.140
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well do you think I doubted you might,</v>

1974
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but very few people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1975
01:37:45.021 --> 01:37:47.870
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want to solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk it over with a friend.</v>

1976
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:50.840
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might just think that you're talking</v>

1977
01:37:50.841 --> 01:37:53.120
<v Speaker 3>about the problem sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what the problem is,</v>

1978
01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:54.680
<v Speaker 3>but you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't,</v>

1979
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you articulate the problem space.</v>

1980
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>You start to generate potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypotheses about solutions.</v>

1981
01:38:02.161 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 3>But more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking to someone,</v>

1982
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:05.063
<v Speaker 3>you can watch them just like the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid with the mouse would watch the </v>

1983
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:07.500
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>

1984
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1985
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 3>here's what I think the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go,</v>

1986
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you know you're listening and you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1987
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:13.680
<v Speaker 3>you roll your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1988
01:38:13.681 --> 01:38:14.514
<v Speaker 3>it's a hint to the person that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the most appropriate way to </v>

1989
01:38:16.681 --> 01:38:19.710
<v Speaker 3>formulate the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe you don't roll your eyes,</v>

1990
01:38:19.711 --> 01:38:20.544
<v Speaker 3>but you know you don't encourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they tell you what the problem </v>

1991
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:25.830
<v Speaker 3>is and you're really actively engaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1992
01:38:25.831 --> 01:38:26.664
<v Speaker 3>You're nodding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then they know that maybe they </v>

1993
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:28.464
<v Speaker 3>formulated the way someone have sane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerable would formulate it and then </v>

1994
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:34.920
<v Speaker 3>they can walk through the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1995
01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:43.180
<v Speaker 3>so when you sit down beside someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to tell you everything,</v>

1996
01:38:43.181 --> 01:38:44.014
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you know is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have anyone to listen to </v>

1997
01:38:46.541 --> 01:38:47.374
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of what happens in therapy and </v>

1998
01:38:51.281 --> 01:38:53.080
<v Speaker 3>a huge part of it is that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened.</v>

1999
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:55.570
<v Speaker 3>I have one client that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I ever do with her.</v>

2000
01:38:55.571 --> 01:38:56.404
<v Speaker 3>She comes in twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once every two weeks and I just sit </v>

2001
01:38:58.331 --> 01:38:59.164
<v Speaker 3>there and listen to her for an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now I can maybe have a bit of a </v>

2002
01:39:02.141 --> 01:39:04.270
<v Speaker 3>discussion with her for the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

2003
01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:07.360
<v Speaker 3>But if I try to say anything for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first 50 minutes,</v>

2004
01:39:07.361 --> 01:39:10.120
<v Speaker 3>she just looks kinda irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2005
01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>it's like I've interrupted the flow of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2006
01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.710
<v Speaker 3>of the interaction and she's alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an everybody to talk to.</v>

2007
01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.360
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2008
01:39:19.690 --> 01:39:23.680
<v Speaker 3>she wants to listen to herself think and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can't do that by herself.</v>

2009
01:39:23.681 --> 01:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>She has to have someone to do it with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2010
01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:27.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think by talking and some people </v>

2011
01:39:29.501 --> 01:39:32.770
<v Speaker 3>have no one to talk to and so their </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems start to spill out.</v>

2012
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:33.783
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by that time you can't even help them </v>

2013
01:39:35.081 --> 01:39:37.450
<v Speaker 3>usually because if you listen for three </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2014
01:39:37.451 --> 01:39:38.284
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be enough listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just listen forever and you'd never </v>

2015
01:39:40.871 --> 01:39:41.830
<v Speaker 3>get to the bottom of it.</v>

2016
01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 3>And the dragon awoke from his nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hungry.</v>

2017
01:40:05.890 --> 01:40:06.723
<v Speaker 3>Bakery truck went by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the smell of fresh bread was more than </v>

2018
01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:14.001
<v Speaker 3>the dragon could resist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dragon ran down the street after the</v>

2019
01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:14.904
<v Speaker 3>bakery truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the house went along of course like the </v>

2020
01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>shell on a snail.</v>

2021
01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.513
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

2022
01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Read this book a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called the glass castle.</v>

2023
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.220
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very cool book.</v>

2024
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:35.743
<v Speaker 3>It's about this woman whose parents were</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely creative and intelligent and </v>

2025
01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.173
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably unconscientious like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>so unconscientious that it was mind </v>

2026
01:40:44.311 --> 01:40:46.520
<v Speaker 3>boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disorderly and non industrious.</v>

2027
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:47.890
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they were,</v>

2028
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:48.743
<v Speaker 3>they were a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic edge of things and you </v>

2029
01:40:51.891 --> 01:40:52.724
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her father would up all sorts of new </v>

2030
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:56.980
<v Speaker 3>ideas and many of them were actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant because he was no idiot,</v>

2031
01:40:56.981 --> 01:40:59.080
<v Speaker 3>but he was kind of a petty crook and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2032
01:40:59.081 --> 01:41:02.200
<v Speaker 3>he'd get gambling trouble and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2033
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:05.580
<v Speaker 3>cheap people at cards and not pay his </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills and so on.</v>

2034
01:41:05.581 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 3>And so like every three months they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to move.</v>

2035
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.600
<v Speaker 3>And like if you have to move every three</v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

2036
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:11.523
<v Speaker 3>you know that the dragon in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>household has got so big that it's </v>

2037
01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:14.584
<v Speaker 3>actually the one that's carrying around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house and that happens to people a </v>

2038
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:18.214
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so their lives are so disorganized </v>

2039
01:41:20.981 --> 01:41:23.020
<v Speaker 3>they can't even stay in one place for </v>
<v Speaker 3>any length of time.</v>

2040
01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.700
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2041
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.813
<v Speaker 3>the mailman was just coming up the paths</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some mail for the big speeds when </v>

2042
01:41:33.141 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 3>their house rush past him and headed </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the street,</v>

2043
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.020
<v Speaker 3>he chased it for a few blogs but he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't catch it.</v>

2044
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:40.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2045
01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:43.213
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you move enough and you're unstable </v>

2046
01:41:44.871 --> 01:41:45.704
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then none of the rest of society can </v>

2047
01:41:48.381 --> 01:41:49.214
<v Speaker 3>communicate with you or stay in touch </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and that deprives you of all </v>

2048
01:41:52.191 --> 01:41:55.760
<v Speaker 3>the benefits that a certain degree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>predictability would confer upon you.</v>

2049
01:41:56.770 --> 01:42:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't get your mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

2050
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Buck bixby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's quite a genius too.</v>

2051
01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>When mixture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Bixby came home for lunch,</v>

2052
01:42:05.631 --> 01:42:07.940
<v Speaker 3>the first thing he noticed was that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>house was gone.</v>

2053
01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like sometimes people don't notice </v>
<v Speaker 3>things until it's got to that point.</v>

2054
01:42:13.101 --> 01:42:13.934
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because now and then you hear a story </v>

2055
01:42:14.631 --> 01:42:15.464
<v Speaker 3>about someone coming home and like their</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife has packed up and taken the </v>

2056
01:42:17.901 --> 01:42:20.600
<v Speaker 3>children and that was the end of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the person says,</v>

2057
01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:21.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that coming.</v>

2058
01:42:21.801 --> 01:42:25.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never saw it coming.</v>

2059
01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.910
<v Speaker 3>And Mr Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conventional sort of guy,</v>

2060
01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:30.980
<v Speaker 3>a little bit on the clueless side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obvious.</v>

2061
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he didn't know what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going on.</v>

2062
01:42:34.371 --> 01:42:35.204
<v Speaker 3>He comes home and his house is gone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a neighbor that has to tell him </v>

2063
01:42:37.821 --> 01:42:38.654
<v Speaker 3>where it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's just as inattentive as </v>

2064
01:42:42.171 --> 01:42:43.004
<v Speaker 3>his wife.</v>

2065
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:44.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2066
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:46.223
<v Speaker 3>Mr Bixby got in his car and went looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the house where he studied all the </v>

2067
01:42:48.961 --> 01:42:49.794
<v Speaker 3>houses as he drove along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally he saw one that looked familiar </v>

2068
01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>belly and Mrs Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're waving from an upstairs window.</v>

2069
01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2070
01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.413
<v Speaker 3>Mr Bixby climbed over the dragon's head </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the porch roof and through the </v>

2071
01:43:11.091 --> 01:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>upstairs window.</v>

2072
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:21.060
<v Speaker 3>How did this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr?</v>

2073
01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Bixby asked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

2074
01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:24.233
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where the story actually </v>

2075
01:43:24.931 --> 01:43:28.380
<v Speaker 3>starts to turn around because somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally admits that there's a problem.</v>

2076
01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.090
<v Speaker 3>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2077
01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:34.050
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is to say there is a problem,</v>

2078
01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you make a statement,</v>

2079
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:37.223
<v Speaker 3>the statement has all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inferential meanings that are attached </v>

2080
01:43:39.931 --> 01:43:41.520
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just to say,</v>

2081
01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:42.563
<v Speaker 3>well what's the problem is also to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that there is a problem and to say </v>

2082
01:43:47.161 --> 01:43:47.994
<v Speaker 3>that it's worthwhile formulating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement that a problem and that it's </v>

2083
01:43:52.281 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big move.</v>

2084
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:55.634
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Carl Rogers said </v>

2085
01:43:56.571 --> 01:43:58.550
<v Speaker 3>about therapy and he's absolutely right </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

2086
01:43:58.551 --> 01:43:59.384
<v Speaker 3>is that there are preconditions for </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic improvement and one of them </v>

2087
01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:03.443
<v Speaker 3>is the person who comes for therapy has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to admit that there's a problem before </v>

2088
01:44:07.011 --> 01:44:09.320
<v Speaker 3>they come and they have to want to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a solution.</v>

2089
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:12.830
<v Speaker 3>And if that situation isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do anything with them.</v>

2090
01:44:12.831 --> 01:44:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had people assigned to me at sometimes</v>

2091
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:18.680
<v Speaker 3>by the court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like court assigned therapy.</v>

2092
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.970
<v Speaker 3>That is not useful because it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person has to say,</v>

2093
01:44:22.971 --> 01:44:25.920
<v Speaker 3>while I'm in trouble and there could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a solution,</v>

2094
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they're just sitting there </v>

2095
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2096
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.863
<v Speaker 3>sort of looking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I had one guy who was a real </v>

2097
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 3>psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a child abuser and you know,</v>

2098
01:44:34.251 --> 01:44:35.084
<v Speaker 3>all he did the whole bloody therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the whole time I was with was brag </v>

2099
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 3>about what a pillar of community he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2100
01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:42.920
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really quite psychopathic,</v>

2101
01:44:42.921 --> 01:44:44.900
<v Speaker 3>so I tried to at least convince him </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2102
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:46.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was likely to continue to get in </v>

2103
01:44:49.661 --> 01:44:51.700
<v Speaker 3>trouble if he didn't stop what he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2104
01:44:51.701 --> 01:44:54.280
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was also one of those people who knew</v>

2105
01:44:54.281 --> 01:44:55.114
<v Speaker 3>absolutely everything and there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing at all that anybody could ever </v>

2106
01:44:57.971 --> 01:44:58.810
<v Speaker 3>tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2107
01:44:58.811 --> 01:45:03.130
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like there was,</v>

2108
01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:04.443
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't any more useful than it would </v>

2109
01:45:06.111 --> 01:45:09.520
<v Speaker 3>have been if I wasn't even in the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>is completely pointless.</v>

2110
01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:13.510
<v Speaker 3>So because he didn't have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else had a problem.</v>

2111
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Dragon wagged his tail happily then even</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster than it had grown.</v>

2112
01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:25.001
<v Speaker 3>The dragon started getting smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sooner is Kipnis sized again.</v>

2113
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:39.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind dragons this size said </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>

2114
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:45.000
<v Speaker 3>she's certainly come around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did it have to grow so big?</v>

2115
01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.473
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure said belly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it just wanted to be </v>

2116
01:45:48.191 --> 01:45:49.024
<v Speaker 3>noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tremendously profound little </v>

2117
01:45:52.511 --> 01:45:53.231
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2118
01:45:53.231 --> 01:45:57.220
<v Speaker 3>because it's got echoes of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

2119
01:45:57.221 --> 01:46:02.221
<v Speaker 3>of Paradise and paradise lost in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dragon and the dragon in the garden.</v>

2120
01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:03.933
<v Speaker 3>But it's even better than that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows how dangerous it is to ignore </v>

2121
01:46:07.301 --> 01:46:08.134
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it caps it off with the </v>

2122
01:46:10.181 --> 01:46:13.630
<v Speaker 3>proposition that even if it's a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragon,</v>

2123
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:16.780
<v Speaker 3>if you just admitted to there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2124
01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:17.913
<v Speaker 3>and look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a high probability that will </v>

2125
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:21.583
<v Speaker 3>shrink to a manageable size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could hardly ask for a better </v>

2126
01:46:24.221 --> 01:46:24.851
<v Speaker 3>ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2127
01:46:24.851 --> 01:46:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maybe they,</v>

2128
01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:28.750
<v Speaker 3>something magic happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thunderbolt,</v>

2129
01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.040
<v Speaker 3>gets rid of the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2130
01:46:30.041 --> 01:46:31.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the wrong kind of ending.</v>

2131
01:46:31.570 --> 01:46:32.261
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2132
01:46:32.261 --> 01:46:33.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stuck with a dragon.</v>

2133
01:46:33.731 --> 01:46:34.564
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you pay attention to the God </v>

2134
01:46:36.121 --> 01:46:39.340
<v Speaker 3>damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then not only does it stay kitten sized,</v>

2135
01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.130
<v Speaker 3>which isn't so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can deal with it.</v>

2136
01:46:42.131 --> 01:46:43.630
<v Speaker 3>And then there's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2137
01:46:43.631 --> 01:46:46.270
<v Speaker 3>do you really want a household with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragons?</v>

2138
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like imagine that because people,</v>

2139
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.320
<v Speaker 3>one of the things Dostoyevsky pointed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in,</v>

2140
01:46:51.321 --> 01:46:54.060
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was in notes from underground,</v>

2141
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:59.061
<v Speaker 3>which is a very powerful commentary on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the foolishness of utopianism.</v>

2142
01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you,</v>

2143
01:47:01.411 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>if you produced a utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wouldn't be any snakes in it,</v>

2144
01:47:03.901 --> 01:47:04.734
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause Utopia is where everything's </v>

2145
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:06.271
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2146
01:47:06.271 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 3>what the hell would you do in a utopia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2147
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you just sit there while everything was </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

2148
01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.173
<v Speaker 3>What we're seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really want everything to be </v>

2149
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:18.180
<v Speaker 3>perfect or do you want to be surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 3>by manageable problems that you can make</v>

2150
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 3>a meaningful contribution to?</v>

2151
01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Well that seems better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2152
01:47:22.171 --> 01:47:23.004
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's something better than </v>

2153
01:47:24.181 --> 01:47:25.650
<v Speaker 3>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2154
01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 3>And what's better than perfection is </v>
<v Speaker 3>manageable imperfection because it gives</v>

2155
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:30.744
<v Speaker 3>you something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things Dostoevsky </v>

2156
01:47:33.331 --> 01:47:35.220
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was back in the late 18 hundreds he</v>

2157
01:47:35.221 --> 01:47:36.054
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>utopia's will never work because people </v>

2158
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:38.814
<v Speaker 3>are basically somewhat insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if things were too perfect around </v>

2159
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:43.974
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the go do is go around and smash </v>

2160
01:47:46.891 --> 01:47:47.724
<v Speaker 3>things until something interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens so that they had something to </v>

2161
01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:51.750
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that seems to be,</v>

2162
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:52.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely right.</v>

2163
01:47:52.951 --> 01:47:56.970
<v Speaker 3>So the moral of the story here is don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore the Damn Dragon,</v>

2164
01:47:56.971 --> 01:48:00.510
<v Speaker 3>but there's more than that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you attend to it properly,</v>

2165
01:48:00.511 --> 01:48:01.344
<v Speaker 3>if you have your eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe the thing will stay </v>

2166
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:05.880
<v Speaker 3>manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a lovely ending.</v>

2167
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we know,</v>

2168
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:07.944
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're dealing with people who have </v>

2169
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:11.020
<v Speaker 3>an anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they had an agoraphobic,</v>

2170
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very terrified.</v>

2171
01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Often they're terrified of death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're really terrified of is this,</v>

2172
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:18.923
<v Speaker 3>they're terrified that they'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>painful and sudden sort of death in </v>

2173
01:48:22.291 --> 01:48:23.124
<v Speaker 3>public while people are watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves make a fool of themselves </v>

2174
01:48:25.891 --> 01:48:28.800
<v Speaker 3>while they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's two elements to it.</v>

2175
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:30.040
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2176
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 3>the fear of mortal vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is real.</v>

2177
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:35.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes people develop agoraphobic</v>

2178
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 3>after they've had heart palpitations or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2179
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's dragon inside when think,</v>

2180
01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:40.951
<v Speaker 3>well my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2181
01:48:40.951 --> 01:48:41.784
<v Speaker 3>I might die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then they go to the emergency </v>

2182
01:48:43.321 --> 01:48:44.154
<v Speaker 3>ward three or four times when they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>panic attacks because they're thinking </v>

2183
01:48:46.231 --> 01:48:48.630
<v Speaker 3>they have heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what are they afraid of?</v>

2184
01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've just figured out that,</v>

2185
01:48:50.251 --> 01:48:51.084
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be walking down the street </v>

2186
01:48:51.781 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 3>one day and die and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2187
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 3>that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2188
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's often people who are quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent,</v>

2189
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:59.303
<v Speaker 3>who've been dependent for much of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and whose dependency relationships </v>

2190
01:49:03.331 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 3>have been disrupted in some way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to manifest the symptoms.</v>

2191
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:08.003
<v Speaker 3>But then if you dig a little bit deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are also concerned about the fact </v>

2192
01:49:10.201 --> 01:49:11.034
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's something unbearable is </v>

2193
01:49:12.991 --> 01:49:13.824
<v Speaker 3>happening to them physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll expose themselves to the public </v>

2194
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and so there'll be watched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of,</v>

2195
01:49:19.591 --> 01:49:22.680
<v Speaker 3>it's both social judgment plus mortality</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>

2196
01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:25.260
<v Speaker 3>which is like the sum of all fears in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>

2197
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:30.360
<v Speaker 3>If you treat agoraphobic people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's quite interesting is you actually</v>

2198
01:49:30.361 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 3>don't ever convince them that the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>is more,</v>

2199
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:35.730
<v Speaker 3>is less dangerous than they have now </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized.</v>

2200
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:40.380
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is it isn't less</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous than they've now realized.</v>

2201
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:42.360
<v Speaker 3>They had just never realized that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2202
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:43.194
<v Speaker 3>And so they'd never really grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you expose them to </v>

2203
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:48.910
<v Speaker 3>situations of danger and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2204
01:49:48.911 --> 01:49:50.770
<v Speaker 3>they habituate and become less </v>
<v Speaker 3>frightened.</v>

2205
01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like that isn't really what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence suggests.</v>

2206
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 3>What the evidence suggests is that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>become braver,</v>

2207
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.440
<v Speaker 3>which is way better because the world is</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

2208
01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.340
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2209
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>if I had to fix you to cure you of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety disorder,</v>

2210
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:03.791
<v Speaker 3>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2211
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:05.380
<v Speaker 3>everything's going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2212
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.161
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2213
01:50:06.161 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 3>you've already figured out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is not going to be all right.</v>

2214
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 3>And so then that question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2215
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>once you figured out that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to be all right,</v>

2216
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:17.830
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is there might be</v>

2217
01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:18.664
<v Speaker 3>a lot more to you than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could easily be that regardless </v>

2218
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:22.900
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 3>how fragile you think you are and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>little of you there is,</v>

2220
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:28.450
<v Speaker 3>that might just be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2221
01:50:28.451 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you exposed yourself to things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were challenging and frightening,</v>

2222
01:50:31.601 --> 01:50:32.434
<v Speaker 3>you'd find out that the monster that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have inside of you has real utility </v>

2223
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:37.390
<v Speaker 3>because you're a lot more dangerous.</v>

2224
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:38.223
<v Speaker 3>And capable than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is what people who are treated </v>

2225
01:50:40.811 --> 01:50:42.730
<v Speaker 3>for anxiety disorders conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>

2226
01:50:42.731 --> 01:50:43.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2227
01:50:43.751 --> 01:50:45.680
<v Speaker 3>so maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually women that have,</v>

2228
01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 3>they have agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite interesting.</v>

2229
01:50:47.681 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you get the woman so she can </v>
<v Speaker 3>now go on subways again and she can take</v>

2230
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:52.234
<v Speaker 3>the Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can go in elevators and then she </v>

2231
01:50:53.051 --> 01:50:54.730
<v Speaker 3>goes home and have this big fight with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her husband,</v>

2232
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:57.580
<v Speaker 3>which he hasn't done in 20 years because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's being too timid,</v>

2233
01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what she's learned is,</v>

2234
01:50:59.471 --> 01:51:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as useless as I think.</v>

2235
01:51:01.151 --> 01:51:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't need as much protection as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I needed.</v>

2236
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:04.324
<v Speaker 3>I can stand up for myself and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then she can take on other challenges </v>

2237
01:51:07.931 --> 01:51:10.480
<v Speaker 3>that she wouldn't have been able to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>on before because you've taught her that</v>

2238
01:51:10.481 --> 01:51:11.314
<v Speaker 3>she's brave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is possible to be brave and </v>

2239
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 3>courageous and that if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually works.</v>

2240
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what happens at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the story.</v>

2241
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:19.354
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2242
01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Mr Bixby finally thinks while there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2243
01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 3>the problem here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should figure out what it is.</v>

2244
01:51:24.551 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 3>And the kid says what it is and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>listens and all of a sudden poof.</v>

2245
01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:30.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's back to manageable proportions.</v>

2246
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.820
<v Speaker 3>And so one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of there aren't that many optimistic</v>

2247
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:34.654
<v Speaker 3>things in philosophy or in psychology or</v>
<v Speaker 3>in life that are truly optimistic and </v>

2248
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:39.334
<v Speaker 3>reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that is both </v>

2249
01:51:41.171 --> 01:51:44.920
<v Speaker 3>optimistic and reliable is you might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hell of a lot tougher than you think.</v>

2250
01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

2251
01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:47.524
<v Speaker 3>when you're assaulted as you will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout your life by terrible things </v>

2252
01:51:51.161 --> 01:51:52.420
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2253
01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:53.254
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point when some of you've </v>

2254
01:51:54.370 --> 01:51:55.203
<v Speaker 3>already done this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to deal say with </v>

2255
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:57.970
<v Speaker 3>the death of a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2256
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.680
<v Speaker 3>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2257
01:52:00.690 --> 01:52:02.290
<v Speaker 3>and in a way that's terrible.</v>

2258
01:52:02.290 --> 01:52:04.450
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible that you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might think,</v>

2259
01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he really loved your parent,</v>

2260
01:52:05.771 --> 01:52:06.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they die,</v>

2261
01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:07.744
<v Speaker 3>then the logical and appropriate thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to fall apart and never be put back </v>

2262
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:12.634
<v Speaker 3>together because anything less would </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that you didn't have sufficient </v>

2263
01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:15.880
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2264
01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:16.961
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2265
01:52:16.961 --> 01:52:18.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a bit of a monster.</v>

2266
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:20.463
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that you can lose a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than you think and you can still </v>

2267
01:52:24.641 --> 01:52:25.421
<v Speaker 3>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2268
01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:28.660
<v Speaker 3>and even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that that's the right thing</v>

2269
01:52:28.661 --> 01:52:29.494
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if a tragedy strikes in your </v>

2270
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:32.890
<v Speaker 3>vicinity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2271
01:52:32.891 --> 01:52:37.891
<v Speaker 3>you can either lay down and fall victim </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it and then add to the problem or you</v>

2272
01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:39.154
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can stand up and take it and deal </v>

2273
01:52:40.721 --> 01:52:41.554
<v Speaker 3>with it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe be a comfort to the other people </v>

2274
01:52:43.661 --> 01:52:48.500
<v Speaker 3>around you that are also suffering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and you can move forward.</v>

2275
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I saw this,</v>

2276
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with this and then we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take a break.</v>

2277
01:52:52.191 --> 01:52:55.940
<v Speaker 3>I had a client at one point who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of very many things.</v>

2278
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:57.043
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a vegetarian and part of that </v>

2279
01:52:58.701 --> 01:52:59.534
<v Speaker 3>was because she was terrified of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she wouldn't go into a supermarket </v>

2280
01:53:02.721 --> 01:53:04.670
<v Speaker 3>where the butcher shop rows are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2281
01:53:04.671 --> 01:53:06.110
<v Speaker 3>you can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2282
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you do that?</v>

2283
01:53:07.521 --> 01:53:08.354
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing but may Hammond carnage </v>

2284
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:10.514
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 3>and you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she saw it,</v>

2286
01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it terrified her.</v>

2287
01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And so I take her to butcher shops now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then get her kind of used to it.</v>

2288
01:53:18.751 --> 01:53:21.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she had a dream at one point,</v>

2289
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:23.840
<v Speaker 3>and I can't remember the exact nature of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dream,</v>

2290
01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:24.674
<v Speaker 3>but it was something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw a gypsy in the forest and the </v>

2291
01:53:27.891 --> 01:53:28.724
<v Speaker 3>Gypsy said to her that unless she </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned how to work in a slaughter </v>

2292
01:53:30.691 --> 01:53:31.524
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd never finished her degree because </v>

2293
01:53:32.811 --> 01:53:33.644
<v Speaker 3>she had been doing her degree forever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she spent like 20 hours a day </v>

2294
01:53:35.781 --> 01:53:36.614
<v Speaker 3>sleeping.</v>

2295
01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 3>So cause she didn't want to be conscious</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was too burdensome.</v>

2296
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 3>So we talked about that dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was quite a remarkable dreamer.</v>

2297
01:53:43.491 --> 01:53:44.181
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2298
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:45.610
<v Speaker 3>you better think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

2299
01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you need to do something that would push</v>
<v Speaker 3>you beyond your limits.</v>

2300
01:53:48.381 --> 01:53:49.214
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've not going to go to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter house because I don't think I </v>

2301
01:53:50.901 --> 01:53:51.734
<v Speaker 3>can arrange that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you better think about what </v>

2302
01:53:53.481 --> 01:53:54.314
<v Speaker 3>you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she went away and she came back </v>

2303
01:53:56.571 --> 01:53:59.960
<v Speaker 3>the next week and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to go see an embalming.</v>

2304
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.030
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

2305
01:54:02.031 --> 01:54:02.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2306
01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

2307
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:05.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's fine.</v>

2308
01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:08.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I called up a few funeral parlors and</v>

2309
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:09.343
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them what was going on and I </v>

2310
01:54:10.911 --> 01:54:11.421
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2311
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:13.550
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that I could bring one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my clients there?</v>

2312
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And they said yes because they're kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of used to deep like they deal with this</v>

2313
01:54:16.731 --> 01:54:17.451
<v Speaker 3>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2314
01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:21.680
<v Speaker 3>These people deal with that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mazing and so,</v>

2315
01:54:21.681 --> 01:54:22.514
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took her there and it was quite an </v>

2316
01:54:24.411 --> 01:54:27.140
<v Speaker 3>exposure experience for me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2317
01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:27.974
<v Speaker 3>cause I'd never seen anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a little bit on the squeamish </v>

2318
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 3>side or maybe even a lot on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 3>we side.</v>

2319
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:33.253
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in there and there was the </v>

2320
01:54:34.671 --> 01:54:39.670
<v Speaker 3>embalming table and the body was laid </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on the table and you know,</v>

2321
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.680
<v Speaker 3>they were doing the prep work that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do in order to preserve the body</v>

2322
01:54:45.681 --> 01:54:47.540
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the funeral in later.</v>

2323
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's quite a gory process,</v>

2324
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:52.160
<v Speaker 3>all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fluid drainage and that</v>

2325
01:54:52.161 --> 01:54:54.950
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she was standing beside me,</v>

2326
01:54:54.951 --> 01:54:56.840
<v Speaker 3>we were outside the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a small room.</v>

2327
01:54:56.841 --> 01:54:57.674
<v Speaker 3>And so we were outside looking through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door and she was basically doing </v>

2328
01:55:00.051 --> 01:55:00.884
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2329
01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:04.793
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as she did that she'd look longer and </v>

2330
01:55:07.591 --> 01:55:08.520
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2331
01:55:08.521 --> 01:55:10.560
<v Speaker 3>And then finally I would say after about</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes,</v>

2332
01:55:10.561 --> 01:55:12.090
<v Speaker 3>she didn't run away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After about 20 minutes,</v>

2333
01:55:12.091 --> 01:55:12.924
<v Speaker 3>she could just watch and then she asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>if she could go inside the room and you </v>

2334
01:55:15.781 --> 01:55:17.130
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy you said that was fine.</v>

2335
01:55:17.131 --> 01:55:20.100
<v Speaker 3>And then she asked if she could touch </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body and like she did all of that,</v>

2336
01:55:20.101 --> 01:55:23.250
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I learned a lot that day too because</v>

2337
01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I talked to them about how funerals are </v>
<v Speaker 3>arranged and all that sort of thing,</v>

2338
01:55:26.461 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 3>which is knowledge you need to know even</v>
<v Speaker 3>though it's terrible knowledge,</v>

2339
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.193
<v Speaker 3>unless you want to be useless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to know about that sort of </v>

2340
01:55:31.861 --> 01:55:34.650
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what was really interesting</v>

2341
01:55:34.651 --> 01:55:39.651
<v Speaker 3>about that was after that she had some </v>
<v Speaker 3>calibration point for her fears,</v>

2342
01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she thinks,</v>

2343
01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:42.870
<v Speaker 3>well I'm terrified at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore I can't.</v>

2344
01:55:42.871 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Do people think that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2345
01:55:45.241 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 3>then she could think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2346
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.333
<v Speaker 3>this is nowhere near as bad is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the mortuary and watching </v>

2347
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:51.960
<v Speaker 3>someone be embalmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2348
01:55:51.961 --> 01:55:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do this.</v>

2349
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:54.661
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2350
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:56.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2351
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a monster to stay alive.</v>

2352
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:01.833
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2353
01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 3>it's better to be conscious monster </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2354
01:56:03.811 --> 01:56:06.540
<v Speaker 3>then an unconscious monster because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2355
01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:11.950
<v Speaker 3>you're in control of the monster rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the other way around.</v>

2356
01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.210
<v Speaker 3>And it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of what this book says is,</v>

2357
01:56:16.211 --> 01:56:16.720
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2358
01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:21.460
<v Speaker 3>if you pay attention to terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can shrink them to manageable size.</v>

2359
01:56:21.490 --> 01:56:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They'll never go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you don't even want them to go</v>

2360
01:56:24.251 --> 01:56:25.084
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least they'll shrink to </v>

2361
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:28.490
<v Speaker 3>manageable size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

2362
01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:32.360
<v Speaker 3>and what that tells you is just how </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody powerful it is to pay attention.</v>

2363
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:36.610
<v Speaker 3>So there's nothing more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention.</v>

2364
01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's take a break for a bit.</v>

2365
01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:41.530
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes.</v>
