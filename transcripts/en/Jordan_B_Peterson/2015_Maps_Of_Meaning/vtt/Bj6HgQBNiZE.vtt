WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever someone just drops.</v>

2
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>What exactly that?</v>

3
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>So we stopped last week.</v>

4
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.623
<v Speaker 2>Just before I start talking about Stalin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mao in one of the things that </v>

6
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 2>happened in the 20th century.</v>

7
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.803
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what appeared to happen was that as </v>

9
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:57.164
<v Speaker 2>soon as the classical religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>substructures in the west became </v>

10
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:02.174
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently undermine that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly replaced with political </v>

11
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.944
<v Speaker 2>utopian dreams and what appeared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur as a consequence of that was </v>

12
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 2>generally nothing but disaster.</v>

13
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly a straight forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter to figure out why.</v>

15
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.573
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.453
<v Speaker 2>I think the case of communism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the most instructive because </v>

17
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>it's the most complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

18
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you still see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of interesting on the campus,</v>

19
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>you still see people handing out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Communist newspaper from time to time.</v>

20
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.433
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is very interesting </v>

21
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 2>because if there were Nazis out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>handing out Nazi newspapers,</v>

22
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 2>there would be hell to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

23
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 2>So why there isn't held to pay when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see communists sanding out,</v>

24
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.470
<v Speaker 2>communist newspapers is not self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident.</v>

25
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Given that the catastrophic catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome of Communist ideology was,</v>

26
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you can make the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was any less devastating than </v>

27
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:20.404
<v Speaker 2>what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to puzzle that out for </v>

28
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.754
<v Speaker 2>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why people have different attitudes to </v>

29
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.663
<v Speaker 2>towards those two different utopian </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes and I think there's two </v>

30
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the first one is,</v>

31
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:38.561
<v Speaker 2>is that the Nazi movement was definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>not universalist,</v>

32
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.053
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for a certain kind of person and </v>

33
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:45.324
<v Speaker 2>that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was for Ariens and not for the </v>

34
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.334
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the communist ideology promised </v>

35
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>like a universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like universal,</v>

36
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.313
<v Speaker 2>and so it's conceivable that it appears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and appeared in still appears more </v>

37
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.630
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally benevolent.</v>

38
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the other interesting twist I think</v>

39
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:21.554
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

40
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

41
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.170
<v Speaker 2>the radical left wing philosophies were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very appealing to intellectuals,</v>

42
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.330
<v Speaker 2>which I wouldn't say that was so true </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fascist in Germany.</v>

43
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.643
<v Speaker 2>Now I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also not say that the academics </v>

44
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:38.804
<v Speaker 2>in Germany and in other countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>comported themselves with a tremendous </v>

45
00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:45.770
<v Speaker 2>amount of courage when the fascist came </v>
<v Speaker 2>to power,</v>

46
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.923
<v Speaker 2>but for one reason or another the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist propositions appeared to be </v>

47
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:52.844
<v Speaker 2>more acceptable and even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even not only acceptable but </v>

48
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:03.334
<v Speaker 2>attractive to people who to academics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and intellectuals who are on the left </v>

49
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When George Orwell wrote a bolt down and</v>

50
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.364
<v Speaker 2>I think he wrote more effectively about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that than anyone else because he was </v>

51
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.604
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sort of a socialist by </v>

52
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 2>inclination even though he was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aristocrat by birth and,</v>

53
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and he had a fair bit of sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the working class,</v>

54
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he had a very difficult time</v>

55
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 2>spending time with people from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>working class,</v>

56
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.543
<v Speaker 2>he said that he had to overcome a fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of class based discussed before he </v>

57
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:50.041
<v Speaker 2>could truly consider himself an advocate</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the working class.</v>

58
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>And he took some pretty extreme steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

59
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 2>he traveled around Europe as a tramp </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less and also worked in very low</v>

60
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:04.381
<v Speaker 2>status jobs including a stint as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a dishwasher,</v>

61
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>low level kitchen employee in </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants in,</v>

62
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.923
<v Speaker 2>in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that are well set </v>

63
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:14.674
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

64
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.143
<v Speaker 2>the pine of Socialists or the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>left wing thinkers that he meant in met </v>

65
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:22.604
<v Speaker 2>in Europe who seemed to have nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatsoever with the working class </v>

66
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.883
<v Speaker 2>except from an intellectual perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they were driven in large part </v>

67
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:33.764
<v Speaker 2>by resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that are well </v>

68
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Speaker 2>said about this particular kind of left </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing individual,</v>

69
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.253
<v Speaker 2>so that would be the privileged </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual left wing who's actually </v>

70
00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:46.304
<v Speaker 2>part of the ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not they would like to admit </v>

71
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:54.071
<v Speaker 2>it was that they weren't driven so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>by sympathy for the poor as they were by</v>

72
00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>hatred for the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a completely phenomena.</v>

73
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.103
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I wrote about</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my introduction to maps of meaning </v>

74
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 2>was my experiences working with the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party in Alberta when I was a</v>

75
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:10.934
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I was about are between about </v>

76
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 2>14 and 17 or 14 and 18 I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

77
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I had privileged access in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the person who was the member of</v>

78
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 2>the Legislative Assembly for our writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the only member of the opposition in</v>

79
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Alberta at that time.</v>

80
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all conservatives and one NDP or,</v>

81
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.073
<v Speaker 2>and he was in our writing even though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't say our writing was left wing </v>

82
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:40.934
<v Speaker 2>by propensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that people where I lived </v>

83
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>actually admired this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was leader of the NDP,</v>

84
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>he was a good guy and the reason they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were voting for him was because he was a</v>

85
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 2>good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly wasn't because he was in,</v>

86
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.023
<v Speaker 2>he was a member of the NDP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in the few years that I was </v>

87
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>involved with the NDP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to know,</v>

88
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.493
<v Speaker 2>I got to know him quite well and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and then peripherally I got to </v>

89
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:04.454
<v Speaker 2>observe the sorts of things they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing out provincial conventions or </v>

90
00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>national conventions and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with,</v>

91
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>because when those conventions came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be associating with some of the</v>

92
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.190
<v Speaker 2>premier's of provinces at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Roy Romer now and and the leader,</v>

93
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:22.334
<v Speaker 2>ed broadbent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a number of the leaders of the </v>

94
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of national labor unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was pretty interesting to observe</v>

95
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:29.624
<v Speaker 2>them because a lot of them were </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed people and they did have the </v>

96
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 2>interests of the working class person in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

97
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.033
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

98
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>But then when I was just associating </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the party hacks,</v>

99
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in general it was a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>different issue because most of them,</v>

100
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 2>as far as I could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't driven by care.</v>

101
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 2>They were driven by resentment and,</v>

102
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.313
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

103
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.683
<v Speaker 2>My experience as a clinical psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 2>has taught me that the two most </v>

104
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>pathological emotions are the two most </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive emotions.</v>

105
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:10.354
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can or attitudes cause I'm not sure </v>

106
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.860
<v Speaker 2>they're exactly emotions is resentment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and arrogance</v>

107
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.123
<v Speaker 2>and resentment seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the observation that the world is </v>

108
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 2>not a fair place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but worse than that,</v>

109
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:29.644
<v Speaker 2>that it's not a fair place in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's particularly unfair to you </v>

110
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.770
<v Speaker 2>because it's obvious that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a fair place.</v>

111
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's predicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the world is a tragic place and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>

113
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.143
<v Speaker 2>If there's any justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's imperfect justice and you might </v>

114
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:48.154
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how can you not be resentful under </v>

115
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:51.790
<v Speaker 2>those conditions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

116
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you not are a powerful question.</v>

117
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>How can you not be resentful under those</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions?</v>

118
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you that all it does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it worse.</v>

119
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.603
<v Speaker 2>And it's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting form of worse </v>

120
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.144
<v Speaker 2>because people justify their resentment </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the system or against being </v>

121
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.874
<v Speaker 2>itself for that matter by rationalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to themselves the fact that it's so </v>

122
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.143
<v Speaker 2>clearly on just that that having any </v>
<v Speaker 2>admiration or support for it verges on </v>

123
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:29.184
<v Speaker 2>the pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is that as </v>

124
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:32.544
<v Speaker 2>soon as you adopt that attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to act in ways that make the </v>

125
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 2>conditions that you were originally </v>
<v Speaker 2>objecting to much worse.</v>

126
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So then instead of being at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral with regards to the problem,</v>

127
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.730
<v Speaker 2>you're accelerating and strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 2>the original issue.</v>

128
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.893
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that's true with </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment and nature actually wrote a </v>

129
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:59.484
<v Speaker 2>fair bit about resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called it [inaudible] tomorrow I </v>

130
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 2>think is if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm pronouncing that correctly.</v>

131
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.613
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

132
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.613
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm wondering how you would and </v>

133
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.593
<v Speaker 3>maybe areas that like if someone feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the world doesn't get them </v>

134
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.840
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's worth for them.</v>

135
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.793
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you reframe that or like help </v>

136
00:10:22.841 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 3>them understand that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

137
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.473
<v Speaker 3>the world isn't fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like not so much worse for you than </v>

138
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:31.510
<v Speaker 3>for any other how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get around that.</v>

139
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.920
<v Speaker 3>How would you get around that with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>patient?</v>

140
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question because you know,</v>

141
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:37.234
<v Speaker 2>that definitely happens is that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in psychotherapy is you often </v>

142
00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:41.950
<v Speaker 2>have someone who has a chip on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>

143
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 2>It just one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know?</v>

144
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.633
<v Speaker 2>And part of it is to disabuse them of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that anyone escapes from </v>

145
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:52.210
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

146
00:10:52.211 --> 00:10:53.044
<v Speaker 2>because one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I think drives </v>

147
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:56.614
<v Speaker 2>class hatred in so far is that still a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant phenomena and I think it's </v>

148
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:00.574
<v Speaker 2>still quite relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people who people have strange </v>

149
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:07.180
<v Speaker 2>ideas about who's rich and who's poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

150
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:08.014
<v Speaker 2>especially in North America because most</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Americans think that anybody who </v>

151
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:15.070
<v Speaker 2>has more money than them is rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

152
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:15.904
<v Speaker 2>When the fact of the matter is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody in North America is rich </v>

153
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:18.994
<v Speaker 2>beyond belief compared to any reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical standard and that almost all </v>

154
00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:25.150
<v Speaker 2>the problems that can be solved with </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

155
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.110
<v Speaker 2>like with magnitude of money have </v>
<v Speaker 2>already been solved in North America.</v>

156
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Speaker 2>There's still problems of relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

157
00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:34.150
<v Speaker 2>but that's a completely different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relative poverty in absolute poverty are</v>

158
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:38.470
<v Speaker 2>not the same problem because relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty has to do with dominance,</v>

159
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.304
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy position and absolute poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with privation and the </v>

160
00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:44.344
<v Speaker 2>argument that there are people in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America who are in privation because </v>

161
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:48.484
<v Speaker 2>they don't have money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an incredibly </v>

162
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>unsophisticated and weak argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might in privation,</v>

163
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>but the probability that that's because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have money or the probability</v>

164
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>that money would six that is virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

165
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give,</v>

166
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.743
<v Speaker 2>I've had plenty of clients in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice and the best times of their </v>

167
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 2>lives were when they had no money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as they had any money,</v>

168
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are in serious trouble.</v>

169
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were often people who are addicted</v>

170
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 2>to something or other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>like alcohol or cocaine.</v>

172
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.880
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they got their unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>check or,</v>

173
00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 2>or even their employment check for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

174
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>they were gone for like four days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 2>and they spent every bloody cent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of that.</v>

176
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>And giving them more money was not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix the problem.</v>

177
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.373
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of people for whom </v>
<v Speaker 2>having more money would not fix their </v>

178
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:37.564
<v Speaker 2>problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy to figure out how to </v>

179
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.384
<v Speaker 2>do sensible things with money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also makes you a target for </v>

180
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>people to take advantage of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually instantaneously.</v>

181
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.613
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that the kind of poverty </v>

182
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:50.854
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes North America is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there because some people don't have </v>

183
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

184
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 2>that's just soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so unsophisticated assessment.</v>

185
00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:58.414
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it assumes that poverty is homogenous </v>

186
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's by no means homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

187
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.234
<v Speaker 2>I also grew up with working class kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hardly any of them graduated from </v>

188
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:08.344
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>

189
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Virtually none of them went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

190
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them went off to work in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil rigs,</v>

191
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn spectacular from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of money.</v>

193
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 2>They never had any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They spent it all,</v>

194
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go work in the Bush for two weeks</v>

195
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 2>and they'd come out for four days or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five days at spend,</v>

196
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$4,000</v>

197
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 2>in the bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of that.</v>

198
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And then they were back in the oil rigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

199
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'd buy a car after working for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year or two,</v>

200
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 2>but they usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.883
<v Speaker 2>and it lost their license because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were driving while impaired or wrap the </v>

202
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>thing around a tree or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

203
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:38.764
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money in some sense had almost no </v>

204
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:42.424
<v Speaker 2>utility for them because money isn't all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that useful unless you know what to do </v>

205
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:45.904
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

206
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to the resentment issue,</v>

207
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orwell's comment on and it's like a </v>

208
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:52.924
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic comment in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things the psych that </v>

209
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.343
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic thought is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really useful for is that it always </v>

210
00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 2>makes you ask a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where's the other half?</v>

211
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this and here's,</v>

212
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 2>and I'm doing it for good reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person,</v>

213
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 2>then the psychoanalytic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychoanalyst always asks,</v>

214
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.571
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

215
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 2>where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the,</v>

216
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>where's the other half of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it projected onto someone else,</v>

217
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:20.434
<v Speaker 2>which is almost always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it lurking around underneath </v>

218
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 2>causing some sort of trouble that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person doesn't want to admit to?</v>

219
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>

220
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 2>very frequently the case as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so orwell's diagnosis for,</v>

221
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral insufficiency of,</v>

222
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

223
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.163
<v Speaker 2>leftwing socialists Utopian left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialists in the United Kingdom was </v>

224
00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:47.414
<v Speaker 2>that they were just resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the intellectuals and the </v>

225
00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:50.774
<v Speaker 2>reason they were resentful because even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though they were smart and privileged </v>

226
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>and well-placed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in universities and so on,</v>

227
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.453
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of people around who had</v>
<v Speaker 2>more money in theoretically more power </v>

228
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 2>than they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was annoying.</v>

229
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.134
<v Speaker 2>And so what they did to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reconcile themselves to that was to </v>

230
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 2>pretend to be advocates for the working </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

231
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.653
<v Speaker 2>but all they were doing was masking </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own resentment about being </v>

232
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>improperly rewarded by the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

233
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 2>And when I read that and I wasn't very </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

234
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I was probably 17 or so when I read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

235
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:23.024
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got it exactly right now he wrote </v>

236
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:31.301
<v Speaker 2>that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book was the road to Wigan pier,</v>

237
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>which is a great book and or well spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of time,</v>

238
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the 30s with a coal miners </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

239
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 2>in the northern Uk.</v>

240
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And I mean those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

241
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 2>they had a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

242
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.443
<v Speaker 2>the coal miners would go out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and then they would have to </v>

243
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 2>crawl down a tunnel way the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground to work.</v>

244
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't stand up in the tunnel </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't tall enough.</v>

245
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 2>So they started their work day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was very long and arduous,</v>

246
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.814
<v Speaker 2>like 12 hours long by crawling three </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarters of a mile on their hands and </v>

247
00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:06.834
<v Speaker 2>knees just to get to where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work and they need to get paid </v>

248
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:10.004
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just like the morning exercise </v>

249
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>before you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:14.683
<v Speaker 2>take a pick ax and hack coal out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>walls for 12 hours and then crawl back </v>

251
00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 2>home and breathing in cold desk the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time so that you were,</v>

252
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old man by the time you were 45 and </v>

253
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 2>had black lung and the working </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions were absolutely appalling.</v>

254
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 2>The company's owned all the houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

255
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 2>they charge the workers as much for rent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and food as they made,</v>

256
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 2>except a little bit more so that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only were they paying all the money they</v>

257
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:40.274
<v Speaker 2>were making back to the companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were falling into debt at the </v>

258
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 2>same time they were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

259
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was no,</v>

260
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:46.784
<v Speaker 2>it was no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it wasn't like Orwell was blind </v>

261
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:54.401
<v Speaker 2>to the basic horrors of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a phenomenal book detailing out</v>

262
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 2>there working conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an onsite observer.</v>

264
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:04.121
<v Speaker 2>But then he followed it up with an essay</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the essay was well,</v>

265
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 2>given the undeniable misery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial working class life,</v>

266
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.023
<v Speaker 2>why is it so difficult for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Socialists Philosophy to become </v>

267
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 2>prevalent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And widespread,</v>

268
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.413
<v Speaker 2>prevalent enough and widespread enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK so that it has some permanent </v>

269
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his answer to that was,</v>

270
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:22.874
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because most of the people who are </v>

271
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.783
<v Speaker 2>leading the working class political </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements don't care one bit about the </v>

272
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:30.764
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>

273
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 2>They're just mad about the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that's dead on.</v>

274
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:36.614
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that if you ever do an </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of any sort of political </v>

275
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 2>movement without factoring in the effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of resentment,</v>

276
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you're just not paying any attention at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

277
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 2>The question isn't who do people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are they supporting?</v>

278
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:51.380
<v Speaker 2>The question is who are they attempting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>

279
00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:52.214
<v Speaker 2>We'll press with their support of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else and it's just as true on </v>

280
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:55.974
<v Speaker 2>the right as it is on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making any comments at the </v>

281
00:17:58.441 --> 00:17:59.274
<v Speaker 2>moment about the right because at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>on university campuses we've already </v>

282
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:07.311
<v Speaker 2>decided that the radical right is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is morally intolerable.</v>

283
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.023
<v Speaker 2>They can't even show their face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we're perfectly willing to </v>

284
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 2>accept the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that never fails to</v>

285
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.943
<v Speaker 2>amaze me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also never fails to amaze me that </v>

286
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 2>people don't even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

287
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know,</v>

288
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 2>cause I've asked students this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after year after year,</v>

289
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>the number of students who knows no what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the Soviet Union or in China</v>

290
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 2>during World War II pales in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the number of students who know about</v>

291
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

292
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 2>even though they might not know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much about the Holocaust.</v>

293
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to explain how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

294
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.260
<v Speaker 2>well then I'll go a little farther with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

295
00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:03.094
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that orwell wrote </v>

296
00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:06.514
<v Speaker 2>what he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really the first Western </v>

297
00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:11.380
<v Speaker 2>intellectual who woke up to what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in the Soviet Union.</v>

298
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.243
<v Speaker 2>And he basically woke up in the 1930s </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it got complicated too because in </v>

299
00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:20.290
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just before World War II,</v>

300
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the good guys were the communists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

301
00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Because there was a split essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the radical left and the radical</v>

302
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.450
<v Speaker 2>right in Spain and the radical right </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

303
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And so Spain was basically fascist until</v>
<v Speaker 2>1982 under,</v>

304
00:19:34.991 --> 00:19:35.824
<v Speaker 2>under Franco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Franco was an ally of Hitler and </v>

305
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Mussolini and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so during the 1930s,</v>

306
00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:44.530
<v Speaker 2>it was considered quite heroic if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

307
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.293
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young intellectual to go to Spain and </v>

308
00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:49.750
<v Speaker 2>fight on the side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

309
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.340
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the left.</v>

310
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was</v>

311
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.913
<v Speaker 2>that kind of set the moral tone in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense because I think you could make a </v>

312
00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.394
<v Speaker 2>case that in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wingers were the good guys in </v>

313
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:06.324
<v Speaker 2>that particular struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not obvious by any </v>

314
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:10.254
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would've stayed the good guys </v>

315
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>if they would have won the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of it is,</v>

316
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 2>is that among intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the left as freedom fighters</v>

317
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.343
<v Speaker 2>took on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took quite strong hold in the Spanish </v>

318
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 2>civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I know that's where Orwell,</v>

319
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>it impact in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

320
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>it was exposed to it and the romance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that continued.</v>

321
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:29.934
<v Speaker 2>But so that's one possible answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one I think is the communist </v>

322
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:34.884
<v Speaker 2>universalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that fascism was an anti </v>

323
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 2>intellectual movement to its core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas communism wasn't,</v>

324
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was often led by intellectuals and it</v>

325
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>was really an doctrine.</v>

326
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.863
<v Speaker 2>Whereas fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say was fundamentally an </v>

327
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 2>emotional doctrine or a dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine or,</v>

328
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.144
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot more primordial because it </v>

329
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was race based fundamentally,</v>

330
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

331
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young believed that the fascists,</v>

332
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the fascism in Germany was a reawakening</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pre Christian paganism,</v>

333
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.210
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.343
<v Speaker 2>like real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real really like blood-based </v>

335
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.313
<v Speaker 2>tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he thought of it as a regressive </v>

336
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

337
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.103
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's certainly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that's worth considering the </v>

338
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 2>communists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:25.294
<v Speaker 2>they laid out a rational description of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their upcoming utopia and it actually </v>

340
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 2>made quite a bit of sense from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational perspective,</v>

341
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:33.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you start with a </v>

342
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 2>proposition like from each according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to each according to their</v>

343
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

344
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it sounds attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 2>because the proposition is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

346
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:45.514
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should obtain what you need from </v>

347
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:48.184
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

348
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in trouble or if you're in,</v>

349
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're sick or if you're hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there should be a,</v>

350
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.850
<v Speaker 2>a backup for you so that you just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall out of society.</v>

351
00:21:58.851 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and parish.</v>

352
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.173
<v Speaker 2>And by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not ask of people what they can </v>

353
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:05.374
<v Speaker 2>contribute so that the stronger people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the more able people contribute as </v>

354
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:09.814
<v Speaker 2>much as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the last April people contribute as </v>

355
00:22:11.381 --> 00:22:12.214
<v Speaker 2>much as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some sense there's something </v>

356
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.820
<v Speaker 2>that's universally fair about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

357
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

358
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.380
<v Speaker 2>as a set of logical propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not self evident that it's wrong.</v>

359
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

360
00:22:26.431 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I would say that certainly in Russia for</v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

361
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Speaker 2>which was basically surfs and Derisk </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick Kratz,</v>

362
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the point of the first world war,</v>

363
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:41.290
<v Speaker 2>because the Russians were just crawling </v>
<v Speaker 2>out from beneath a czarist monarchy that</v>

364
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 2>was basically medieval in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

365
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty attractive.</v>

366
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:46.863
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem was who attractive to who </v>

367
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.513
<v Speaker 2>and the way it played out in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can just imagine this for </v>

368
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that there is a village.</v>

369
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:57.004
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia and the Soviet Union was a </v>

370
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:00.874
<v Speaker 2>process called D Kula causation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Kulaks were the co Kulak was a </v>

371
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:10.831
<v Speaker 2>name given to the farmers in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union who were in say in a given village</v>

372
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 2>who were reasonably prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those might be people that have a</v>

373
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:16.504
<v Speaker 2>brick house and who have been running </v>
<v Speaker 2>their farm for whatever reason well </v>

374
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>enough so that they could have a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

375
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.723
<v Speaker 2>Now one of the propositions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical left in the Soviet Union was </v>

376
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:29.944
<v Speaker 2>that if you had any capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that basically if you had any excess </v>

377
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:35.614
<v Speaker 2>money at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be enough money maybe to </v>

378
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 2>buy a brick house and to improve your </v>
<v Speaker 2>machinery into hire a couple of people,</v>

379
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.643
<v Speaker 2>that fundamentally what you had done was</v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen that from the Labor of the </v>

380
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>proletariat of the working class.</v>

381
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can understand that,</v>

382
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 2>cause that's a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a Marxist idea.</v>

383
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:56.264
<v Speaker 2>The Marxist idea was that Labor produces</v>
<v Speaker 2>excess value and that what capital does </v>

384
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 2>is vacuum up that value and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>steal it.</v>

385
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>And so there's never really any </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation in,</v>

386
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.543
<v Speaker 2>in the Marxist doctrine that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative things that can be done with </v>

387
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:15.074
<v Speaker 2>capital itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that Labor is actually rather </v>

388
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.310
<v Speaker 2>difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>

389
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 2>define,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 2>like good example of that is with say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about Bill Gates.</v>

391
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

392
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to make the case that Bill</v>

393
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.113
<v Speaker 2>Gates made $70 billion by exploiting his</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers or as customers doesn't seem to </v>

394
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:43.090
<v Speaker 2>me that that's an accurate description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

395
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.933
<v Speaker 2>Now you can argue about the details with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to certain mon monopolistic </v>

396
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 2>practices and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

397
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:51.764
<v Speaker 2>what I saw happening with Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm older than you guys and I </v>

398
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:55.790
<v Speaker 2>watched what happened.</v>

399
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 2>The computer's really kicked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in about 1993,</v>

400
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.163
<v Speaker 2>although we were using them fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>extensively by 1985 of the net kicked </v>

401
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:05.300
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1993.</v>

402
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.253
<v Speaker 2>What happened before gates was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs were sold one by one and they </v>

403
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:15.050
<v Speaker 2>were unbelievably expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

404
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:15.884
<v Speaker 2>so a typical word processing program at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dawn of the computer age would have </v>

405
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>been approximately as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer was,</v>

406
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 2>which was way more expensive than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are now.</v>

407
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 2>And what happened with gates was he </v>
<v Speaker 2>bundled programs together.</v>

408
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 2>That would be the Microsoft office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft office suite,</v>

409
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 2>and drop their prices by a factor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 20.</v>

410
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>

411
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 2>everybody had Microsoft office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a brilliant marketing ploy.</v>

412
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was that he noticed that </v>

413
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 2>the price of software rabidly plummets </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards commodity level.</v>

414
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just accelerated the process.</v>

415
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.153
<v Speaker 2>So my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that regardless of what you think </v>

416
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 2>about Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that he got his money merely by</v>

417
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 2>stealing it from the Labor that produced</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

418
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.443
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

419
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.350
<v Speaker 2>products is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unsophisticated approach.</v>

420
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.213
<v Speaker 2>It's not self evident in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case that large pools of </v>

421
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:16.450
<v Speaker 2>you got to ask yourself if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

423
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>if capital was distributed equally among</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population,</v>

424
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:20.264
<v Speaker 2>while the first thing you can be sure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it wouldn't stay equally </v>

425
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 2>distributed for very long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not very long at all.</v>

426
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it also begs the question is,</v>

427
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.464
<v Speaker 2>do you want a system where the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have substantial economic </v>

428
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 2>power are actually members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government?</v>

429
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Or is it safer to have large pools of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital somewhat arbitrarily distributed</v>

430
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 2>in the general population?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there multiple sources of power,</v>

431
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you think about what's happening </v>

432
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 2>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

433
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.253
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem self evident to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise of multiple millionaires and </v>

434
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 2>multiple billionaires in China has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad thing for the population.</v>

435
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.833
<v Speaker 2>Not least because those people hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>power that can buttress the entire </v>

436
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 2>society against the overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrality of the government.</v>

437
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you might argue that you know,</v>

438
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.323
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have that money because </v>

439
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose in you can make a case for</v>

440
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

441
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's very unit dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thinking.</v>

442
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 2>And another thing that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is that there are certain kinds of</v>

443
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.944
<v Speaker 2>projects that can't be undertaken </v>
<v Speaker 2>without massive pools of private </v>

444
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

445
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 2>if you want to build a chip fabrication </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant,</v>

446
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.333
<v Speaker 2>it's $4 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those aren't going to get built </v>

447
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 2>unless there are large pools of unused </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>

448
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 2>more or less at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

449
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:40.884
<v Speaker 2>Ilan Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example right now is going to build </v>

450
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 2>a massive factory to produce a new kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of lithium ion battery.</v>

451
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:48.444
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be staggeringly </v>

452
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:52.110
<v Speaker 2>expensive and he has no idea if that'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

453
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 2>And probably it's hard to say probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't because most things don't work,</v>

454
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.883
<v Speaker 2>but there's not even a chance that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>project like that could get off the </v>

455
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:02.784
<v Speaker 2>ground given it's unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably high risk nature and the </v>

456
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.374
<v Speaker 2>demand for excessive levels of capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless he happened to have more money </v>

457
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:15.740
<v Speaker 2>than God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's necessary to,</v>

458
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.020
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to analyze problems at a high resolution</v>

459
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:24.021
<v Speaker 2>level and not fall into the foolishness </v>
<v Speaker 2>of unit dimensional utopian schemes.</v>

460
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 2>And partly because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be speaks ignorance as far as I'm</v>

461
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:29.334
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you use an ideological approach to a </v>

462
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:31.524
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that means to me is that you don't </v>

463
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:33.624
<v Speaker 2>know what the hell you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you're too lazy to figure it </v>

464
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

465
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.303
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but worse than that is that underneath </v>

466
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.054
<v Speaker 2>the ideological presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always some kind of hatred of </v>

467
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:49.911
<v Speaker 2>one form or another that's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never agreed to by the people who happen</v>

468
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>to be in that position on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological spectrum.</v>

469
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.030
<v Speaker 2>And that turns out to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tremendously dangerous.</v>

470
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.153
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know someone who's a businessman </v>

471
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 2>who's had a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>

472
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

473
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't permanent success in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

474
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 2>although success is rel rarely </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent.</v>

475
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him about both left and </v>

476
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 2>right wing approaches to economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>revitalization in Canada.</v>

477
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.873
<v Speaker 2>And one of his primary claims is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada's too unsophisticated and it's </v>

478
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:26.334
<v Speaker 2>legal and political systems to support </v>
<v Speaker 2>high tech industries against </v>

479
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 2>international competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>

480
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>we just don't have the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>

481
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>conceptually or legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he says,</v>

482
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left wingers,</v>

483
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their basic is that while you don't need</v>

484
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.223
<v Speaker 2>large corporations and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more of a pain in the neck than </v>

485
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.033
<v Speaker 2>they're worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly there's no sense in the </v>

486
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 2>government supporting businessmen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just not helpful because most</v>

487
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:55.744
<v Speaker 2>countries that have tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful say intellectual property </v>

488
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.783
<v Speaker 2>companies and which is where all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money is now have a legal system behind </v>

489
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:05.404
<v Speaker 2>them and a governmental system behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that's doing absolutely everything </v>

490
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:08.584
<v Speaker 2>they can to support the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those companies out into the </v>

491
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 2>international market and to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they succeed.</v>

492
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 2>And then on the right you have people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who say,</v>

493
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:20.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is pair government </v>

494
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:22.714
<v Speaker 2>down to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the entrepreneurs can go out </v>

495
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:27.340
<v Speaker 2>there and make money and you know from </v>
<v Speaker 2>his perspective,</v>

496
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's an extraordinary well informed </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

497
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:31.804
<v Speaker 2>neither of those solutions are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work because the world is too damn </v>

498
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 2>complicated for the answer from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to be,</v>

499
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 2>well we need less government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

500
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 2>that's not an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

501
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Any Moron can say that in one second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

502
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not a co coherent system of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

503
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 2>It's devoted to the solving of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific problem.</v>

504
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's way to row low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

505
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And then you can easily untangled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights claims because,</v>

506
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:56.074
<v Speaker 2>because the right is basically orderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because there's somewhat disgust </v>

507
00:30:58.631 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 2>sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at people who are reading the,</v>

508
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the low end of the dominance </v>

509
00:31:03.941 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy distributions.</v>

510
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.003
<v Speaker 2>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's just useless bastard to never </v>

511
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 2>do any work that are down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they would just,</v>

512
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off their ass and look around there </v>

513
00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:12.854
<v Speaker 2>be a job for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about that is that it's </v>

514
00:31:14.981 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 2>true for a certain percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they're referring to because</v>

515
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 2>there are unconscientious people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do a damn thing.</v>

516
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.033
<v Speaker 2>But then it's untrue because there's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of reasons why people end up at </v>

517
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:27.964
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them have to do with the </v>

518
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 2>fact that they're not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>

519
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:37.480
<v Speaker 2>which is why conscientiousness predicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>success over the span of your life in a,</v>

520
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a western democracy.</v>

521
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:40.894
<v Speaker 2>But then there's all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why people aren't thriving that </v>

522
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

523
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.113
<v Speaker 2>their willingness to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not sort of approach that's </v>

524
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 2>useful for solving any sort of complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

525
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the additional problem,</v>

526
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:57.274
<v Speaker 2>which is that the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering utopian solutions aren't who </v>

527
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 2>they say they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem.</v>

528
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.043
<v Speaker 2>And I think we learned that we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have learned that more than anything </v>

529
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 2>else by looking at what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century.</v>

530
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.880
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fact that like,</v>

531
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 2>just out of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I've asked you this before,</v>

532
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:15.904
<v Speaker 2>but how many of you were aware that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stellan starves 6 million people in the </v>

533
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine in the 1930s okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you learn that?</v>

534
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

535
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.410
<v Speaker 2>so you knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>

536
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I was really interested in that.</v>

537
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.730
<v Speaker 2>So did you learn that on your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:36.803
<v Speaker 2>You learned that on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people were taught that in you </v>

539
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:46.210
<v Speaker 2>were were okay after university?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

540
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

541
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody else learned at university</v>

542
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.063
<v Speaker 3>projects?</v>

543
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange form of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

544
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.800
<v Speaker 3>In a class like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like</v>

545
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.533
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the 6 million deaths in the Ukraine </v>

546
00:33:16.951 --> 00:33:20.790
<v Speaker 2>in the 1930s that's not like this by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way</v>

547
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:22.403
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

548
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

549
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

550
00:33:26.281 --> 00:33:27.114
<v Speaker 2>and now it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the tiny tip of what </v>

551
00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:32.640
<v Speaker 2>happened in the Soviet Union between </v>
<v Speaker 2>1919 to 1959</v>

552
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.823
<v Speaker 3>it was embarrassing.</v>

553
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 2>It should be embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

554
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.581
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

556
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.843
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's so terrible about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what happened in the 20th </v>

557
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 2>century is something that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

558
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 2>We have to understand it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>

559
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

560
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the commission of those atrocities both </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left wing and the right wing,</v>

561
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.943
<v Speaker 2>especially when you view them from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzschean or Dostoyevsky and </v>

562
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:58.694
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that while they were the </v>

563
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:02.710
<v Speaker 2>inevitable consequence of the collapse </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

564
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 2>of traditional religious systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

565
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.720
<v Speaker 2>that that is something that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important that it's the most vital thing</v>

566
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 2>you need to know in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

567
00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

568
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.210
<v Speaker 2>and this is sort of creeping up on us </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

569
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>

570
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:24.703
<v Speaker 2>the potential for nuclear holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really a partners in 1962 and </v>

571
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:33.671
<v Speaker 2>in 1984 was a direct consequence of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>utopian of the,</v>

572
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>of the battle for various utopias.</v>

573
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just about wiped us out.</v>

574
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we haven't solved that problem yet.</v>

575
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.890
<v Speaker 2>We haven't solved it at all because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old horror.</v>

576
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:46.724
<v Speaker 2>So Cyrus problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how do you stop your damn </v>

577
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 2>institutions from becoming genocidally </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt?</v>

578
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

579
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.253
<v Speaker 2>that's a cross cutting problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like how do you stop the </v>

580
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:00.194
<v Speaker 2>government from becoming corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or how do you stop corporations from </v>

581
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:03.884
<v Speaker 2>becoming corrupt even though those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>two perfectly reasonable sets of </v>

582
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:09.830
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see how they're different.</v>

583
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then how do you,</v>

584
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.633
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you act within </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions so that you don't become </v>

585
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.504
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and also so that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>further the corruption of the </v>

586
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:21.944
<v Speaker 2>institution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can be absolutely sure that for </v>

587
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.064
<v Speaker 2>all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be one of the most </v>

588
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 2>fundamental ethical problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>face throughout your entire life because</v>

589
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you're all going to be members in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way or another,</v>

590
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:35.630
<v Speaker 2>have large and powerful institutions.</v>

591
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.243
<v Speaker 2>So the way you comport yourself in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions is going to determine in </v>

592
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:42.084
<v Speaker 2>large degree the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a slave or a free person </v>

593
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:47.064
<v Speaker 2>or a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also whether or not the institution </v>

594
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 2>within which you work becomes tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 2>and destructive.</v>

595
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 2>And like I see this particularly in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical practice,</v>

596
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.523
<v Speaker 2>lots of the people who I've dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their problem has been pathologies in </v>

597
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 2>their workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bullied by a manager,</v>

598
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe by a coworker,</v>

599
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.743
<v Speaker 2>or they're driven to absolute insanity </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the proliferation of completely </v>

600
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive and crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

601
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 2>regulations and rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

602
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.373
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally they're too afraid to do </v>

603
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

604
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.943
<v Speaker 2>but that's not helpful because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're afraid to stand up and stop </v>

605
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they pay a price,</v>

606
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 2>possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often not the price.</v>

607
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:36.320
<v Speaker 2>They think they'll pay it by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

608
00:36:36.321 --> 00:36:37.154
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they don't stand up and do </v>

609
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:38.934
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also pay a price in my observation </v>

610
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.694
<v Speaker 2>has been that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that although that's a price you pay </v>

611
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.040
<v Speaker 2>ounce with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Flash,</v>

612
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 2>ounce by ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of one pound at a time,</v>

613
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.533
<v Speaker 2>you end up losing more over the long run</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you do by standing up and having </v>

614
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>something to say.</v>

615
00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your advice.</v>

616
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 4>My partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a contractor,</v>

617
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.663
<v Speaker 4>the contract or another contractor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the contractor was giving you a part of </v>

618
00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:07.420
<v Speaker 4>my power is in your story matters and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

619
00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:09.430
<v Speaker 4>And then sort of sad like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

620
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 4>if not interested in doing the work or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

621
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.690
<v Speaker 4>then forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>

622
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 4>my boyfriend by tax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the best medication or whatever,</v>

623
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.630
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

624
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.280
<v Speaker 4>you know him would say if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared to walk away then you know,</v>

625
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.740
<v Speaker 4>you're never really going to get their </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights back.</v>

626
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.940
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared to walk away.</v>

627
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:38.470
<v Speaker 4>You think strong minded like he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely put it in.</v>

628
00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:39.794
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can edit it down a bit from what he </v>

629
00:37:42.791 --> 00:37:43.624
<v Speaker 4>would normally do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it actually worked out for the </v>

630
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:46.931
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It suddenly,</v>

631
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 4>oh hours increased responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>increased.</v>

632
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Once you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

633
00:37:51.641 --> 00:37:52.474
<v Speaker 4>like you're mismanaging me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that I don't want to work more </v>

634
00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:58.990
<v Speaker 4>is that you know that the problem here </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want to hire someone else,</v>

635
00:37:58.991 --> 00:38:00.550
<v Speaker 4>then I implore you to go do that.</v>

636
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.313
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about people who are </v>

637
00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:09.601
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical is that they're often weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they'll,</v>

638
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.940
<v Speaker 2>they'll push on you and they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any real internal boundaries.</v>

639
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.370
<v Speaker 2>They'll push on you and push on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as you can be pushed,</v>

640
00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.413
<v Speaker 2>there's no ending to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they may even delight in that </v>

641
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.643
<v Speaker 2>because if they're weak and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they can exercise some </v>

642
00:38:29.771 --> 00:38:32.500
<v Speaker 2>power and caused some misery is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite satisfying.</v>

643
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:33.963
<v Speaker 2>Especially maybe if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also jealous of you for one </v>

644
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:37.414
<v Speaker 2>reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can really make your life </v>

645
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.130
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

646
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.260
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways to my partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

647
00:38:43.261 --> 00:38:46.050
<v Speaker 4>So I think that it was coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place of insecurity.</v>

648
00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

649
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a very common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

650
00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.034
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

651
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.270
<v Speaker 2>it's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys will all experience that</v>

652
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.300
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or meet it out as you move through your,</v>

653
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:57.680
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

654
00:38:57.681 --> 00:38:58.514
<v Speaker 2>Because there'll be lots of times when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a situation where you're </v>

655
00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:04.040
<v Speaker 2>smarter and more competent than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's supervising you.</v>

656
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.470
<v Speaker 2>And you might have your head screwed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight or two.</v>

657
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.633
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the loss would be times where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supervising someone who's like </v>

658
00:39:10.611 --> 00:39:13.760
<v Speaker 2>that and they have advantages over you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

660
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.323
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're willing to walk and you tell </v>

661
00:39:20.601 --> 00:39:24.740
<v Speaker 2>the person exactly what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will leave you alone from then on.</v>

662
00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:28.490
<v Speaker 2>They will walk a wide berth around you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and leave you the hell alone.</v>

663
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:29.421
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:39:29.421 --> 00:39:30.254
<v Speaker 2>they might cause some conspiratorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble in one place or another trying </v>

665
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:34.850
<v Speaker 2>to get back at you.</v>

666
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.880
<v Speaker 2>But my experience has been that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rare than you think.</v>

667
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:39.530
<v Speaker 2>In general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not very effective.</v>

668
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.660
<v Speaker 2>But unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

669
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the things soldier Nixon talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

670
00:39:43.821 --> 00:39:44.654
<v Speaker 2>and Frankel as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is all relevant to the last </v>

671
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:47.840
<v Speaker 2>half of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

672
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where should your fundamental value find</v>

673
00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:53.720
<v Speaker 2>itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

674
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about the hierarchy </v>

675
00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:58.130
<v Speaker 2>of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

676
00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.353
<v Speaker 2>I've showed you that idea many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your action is nested inside a </v>

677
00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:08.240
<v Speaker 2>conceptual map and that's nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>another conceptual map and so forth,</v>

678
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:09.643
<v Speaker 2>all the way out as far as you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I'd been </v>

679
00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:13.670
<v Speaker 2>curious about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

680
00:40:13.671 --> 00:40:16.580
<v Speaker 2>how far out can you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

681
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I think I know actually how far out you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go.</v>

682
00:40:19.221 --> 00:40:20.054
<v Speaker 2>I think the ultimate question I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>for human beings is whether or not </v>

683
00:40:26.721 --> 00:40:29.450
<v Speaker 2>they're working to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place or a worse place.</v>

684
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could say better by whose </v>

685
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:33.494
<v Speaker 2>standards are worse by whose standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't care about that question </v>

686
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.210
<v Speaker 2>because I would say that for each </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

687
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.523
<v Speaker 2>they're either trying to make the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>a better place by their standards or a </v>

688
00:40:45.111 --> 00:40:45.944
<v Speaker 2>worse place by their standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question of absolute standards </v>

689
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:53.330
<v Speaker 2>actually doesn't enter into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because if you're resentful and,</v>

690
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.553
<v Speaker 2>and while we'll just go with resentful </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause resentment moves towards </v>

691
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.430
<v Speaker 2>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves towards genocide fundamentally,</v>

692
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 2>now it takes a while to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's really where it's headed.</v>

693
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:05.623
<v Speaker 2>If you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to do is try to make </v>

694
00:41:07.161 --> 00:41:10.190
<v Speaker 2>the world a worse place in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative manner you can think up.</v>

695
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And you'll know it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

696
00:41:12.501 --> 00:41:14.480
<v Speaker 2>you might be a little wrong and maybe by</v>
<v Speaker 2>accident,</v>

697
00:41:14.481 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 2>some time when you try to make something</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

698
00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it'll get better.</v>

699
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.910
<v Speaker 2>But that's just a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you don't know what you're</v>

700
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:20.744
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know bloody well know what you're </v>

701
00:41:21.831 --> 00:41:22.664
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people know exactly what </v>

702
00:41:24.141 --> 00:41:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they're doing at each time they make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision,</v>

703
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.220
<v Speaker 2>not that they necessarily know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing across large spans of time</v>

704
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.443
<v Speaker 2>and not that they necessarily all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those decisions because you don't </v>

705
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 2>remember any of your decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

706
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.533
<v Speaker 2>They just start manifesting themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the world as consequences and </v>

707
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:43.034
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you also start to build systems in </v>

708
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:45.374
<v Speaker 2>your head that do things automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you're resentful and you </v>

709
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 2>act on that repeatedly for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to build a little automatic</v>

710
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 2>resentment monster at the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

711
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's just going to do things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that without you even noticing.</v>

712
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's when you become unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

713
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 2>in the psychoanalytic way.</v>

714
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 2>You're bloody conscious when you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the decisions.</v>

715
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Now you might not be fully conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the repercussions,</v>

716
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it matters at all.</v>

717
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.533
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I've observed or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I've observed is that I've never </v>

718
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:21.851
<v Speaker 2>seen anyone ever get away with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ever did and I think the reason for</v>

719
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's quite clear,</v>

720
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 2>it's that if what you're dealing with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

721
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>

722
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 2>it's actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has some structure.</v>

723
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 2>If you bend or twist it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that twist and Ben stays there,</v>

724
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:37.154
<v Speaker 2>it's going to snap back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to cause some trail of like </v>

725
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:41.174
<v Speaker 2>some causal trail of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the trail might be so peculiar and </v>

726
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 2>bizarre that by the time it produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative outcome for you,</v>

727
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.220
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what the initial cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

728
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you what tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of what you do in psychotherapy,</v>

729
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:56.534
<v Speaker 2>especially of the more psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety rather than the behavioral </v>

730
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:03.680
<v Speaker 2>problem solving variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also extraordinarily useful.</v>

731
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's primarily useful is,</v>

732
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did this happen?</v>

733
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And you trace it back and you trace it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and you trace it back and you trace</v>

734
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 2>it back and then all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person goes,</v>

735
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Aha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's how the dominoes fell.</v>

736
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:18.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

737
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's horrifying because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the initial problem isn't even</v>

738
00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:24.824
<v Speaker 2>the persons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like something that happened </v>

739
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 2>between their mother and their and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother's father.</v>

740
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.733
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can certainly be the person who </v>

741
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 2>inherits multigenerational Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

742
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.780
<v Speaker 2>that's basically old cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think of,</v>

743
00:43:38.781 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus as multigenerational Karma,</v>

744
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you inherit all of the errors that are </v>

745
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:47.000
<v Speaker 2>embedded in the adaptive system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

746
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's also what makes young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>often resentful about,</v>

747
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power structure,</v>

748
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

749
00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 2>or the military industrial complex or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it.</v>

750
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.383
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the bloody thinks corrupt and </v>

751
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>half ready to fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 2>it is because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things get outdated.</v>

753
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Just as time progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>

754
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 2>they get outdated and corrupt because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are willfully blind and refuse to</v>

755
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.200
<v Speaker 2>update them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're stuck with that.</v>

756
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:19.034
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck with that from a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and you're stuck with that </v>

757
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your own individual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>familial history.</v>

758
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's partly why I wanted to portray it</v>

759
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 2>in this class as an existential problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

760
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.703
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

761
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't take it personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a condition of life.</v>

762
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.743
<v Speaker 2>It's like fragility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual fragility as a condition of </v>

763
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:45.804
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck with having to deal with </v>

764
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Speaker 2>that corruption of society is a fact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

765
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.063
<v Speaker 2>You have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The perversity of the natural world and </v>

766
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fact of life.</v>

767
00:44:58.171 --> 00:44:59.004
<v Speaker 2>And then the chaos that underlies </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that you come from and that </v>

768
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 2>you will return to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also a fact of life.</v>

769
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.383
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are ugly fact because I've </v>

770
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 2>only concentrated on the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>element there,</v>

771
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 2>but those are ugly fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>

772
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should you do about that?</v>

773
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.423
<v Speaker 2>And despair and nihilism and resentment </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a perfectly logically reasonable </v>

774
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is though,</v>

775
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:26.243
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all that does is turn tragedy </v>

776
00:45:29.281 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 2>into hell and it turns out that hell is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually worse than tragedy.</v>

777
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.333
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen this in many situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a while back I was with a family </v>

778
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.003
<v Speaker 2>where one of their family members was </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying and not a particularly pleasant </v>

779
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:45.114
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was associated with a degenerative </v>

780
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 2>brain disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when those are,</v>

781
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not as nasty as they get,</v>

782
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:52.134
<v Speaker 2>but they're certainly up in the plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty category and the family comported </v>

783
00:45:57.511 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>themselves incredibly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

784
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:00.444
<v Speaker 2>they had a lot of experience with death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was a palliative care nurse </v>

785
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:06.000
<v Speaker 2>and most of them had some medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

786
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:07.223
<v Speaker 2>so they weren't naive about such things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the family came together and took </v>

787
00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:13.464
<v Speaker 2>care of the person who was deteriorating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did what they had to to help them </v>

788
00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 2>when it was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the person's prime caretaker,</v>

789
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.300
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her husband was very,</v>

790
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:25.134
<v Speaker 2>very good at admitting when things had </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen down yet another level and doing </v>

791
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:31.194
<v Speaker 2>something about it right then and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of pretending that it wasn't </v>

792
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is a great way to catastrophe.</v>

793
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 2>it was quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not pleasant but it wasn't hell.</v>

795
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 2>They managed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

796
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:44.454
<v Speaker 2>when it pulled the family together a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit better and everybody who was </v>

797
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:48.864
<v Speaker 2>going through the experience had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>support of everybody else and there </v>

798
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.474
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a lot of garbage underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family carpet that that often is this </v>

799
00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:56.084
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing that comes up when </v>
<v Speaker 2>families are extremely stressed and </v>

800
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

801
00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.693
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

802
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.133
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I think they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>gained was that their family tightened </v>

803
00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:09.074
<v Speaker 2>up approximately as much I would say as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the support they lost from the family </v>

804
00:47:14.361 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 2>member who departed now.</v>

805
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 2>So that makes you wonder a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

806
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:22.974
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well obviously the world has this </v>

807
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 2>tremendously negative multilayer </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

808
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 2>but that leaves open the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

809
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you reacted to it properly,</v>

810
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.583
<v Speaker 2>to what degree could you ameliorate it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty damn obvious that you could </v>

811
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.050
<v Speaker 2>make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's easy.</v>

812
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:44.681
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some,</v>

813
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:45.514
<v Speaker 2>if a catastrophe befalls you and all you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do is run around in circles and </v>

814
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 2>panic and you're just as maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe occurs.</v>

815
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:53.854
<v Speaker 2>And it's affecting five people and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart in a cowardly and </v>

816
00:47:57.011 --> 00:47:57.844
<v Speaker 2>pathological manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have two people to deal with </v>

817
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 2>at a time of crisis instead of one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't see that being the least bit</v>

818
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that means,</v>

819
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:08.014
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also something I really don't </v>

820
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 2>understand why people aren't taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

821
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:12.844
<v Speaker 2>is that one of the things you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to learn to be competent in the face </v>

822
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:16.870
<v Speaker 2>of tragedy.</v>

823
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.590
<v Speaker 2>And you also have to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not brutality.</v>

824
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause one of the things you might wonder</v>

825
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:24.124
<v Speaker 2>is if someone close to you dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how morally obligated are you to fall </v>

826
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 2>apart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could easily say,</v>

827
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really love the person,</v>

828
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the devastation should be total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you say,</v>

829
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:36.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be total,</v>

830
00:48:36.321 --> 00:48:38.200
<v Speaker 2>because that just adds to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>

831
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Then what that implies is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of toughness that you have to have,</v>

832
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:43.264
<v Speaker 2>even in intimate relationships that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to remain standing in the </v>

833
00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:47.794
<v Speaker 2>midst of a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about that that's </v>

834
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 2>kind of harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

835
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So if you're the person who has to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>funeral arrangements,</v>

836
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are your parents passes away?</v>

837
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 2>One of the things people might wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

838
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:00.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be calm enough to do that at</v>

839
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 2>a time like that?</v>

840
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 2>But the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

841
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.194
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly at a time like that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you better have your act together and </v>

842
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.374
<v Speaker 2>that means you can't be too afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death and that you can't be too afraid </v>

843
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:14.980
<v Speaker 2>of being left on your own and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be able to stand on your own two</v>

844
00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that in that sort of time,</v>

845
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 2>there's enough of you so that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>of service and,</v>

846
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.860
<v Speaker 2>and support to the people around you who</v>
<v Speaker 2>may be,</v>

847
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:26.720
<v Speaker 2>have fewer resources than you maybe are </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

848
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 2>more helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you can actually help.</v>

849
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's a much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only is that a much better outcome,</v>

850
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:37.924
<v Speaker 2>but it's the right aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way that you should be </v>

851
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 2>conceiving your development in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

852
00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be the sort of person who can</v>

853
00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 2>be relied on when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things fall apart.</v>

854
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.073
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that that's analogous </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what we were talking about before </v>

855
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:50.734
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate from within the confines of </v>

856
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:54.484
<v Speaker 2>pathological structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should not lay yourself so open to </v>

857
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:58.414
<v Speaker 2>loss that if you lose your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means you've configured your life </v>

858
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:02.973
<v Speaker 2>improperly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're so dependent on one person </v>

859
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:05.674
<v Speaker 2>that you cannot tolerate their loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what that means is you have not </v>

860
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:09.904
<v Speaker 2>distributed your support properly along </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the multiple sources of support </v>

861
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 2>that you could conceivably have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't stand on one leg like no legs.</v>

862
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:20.764
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

863
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.220
<v Speaker 2>You're in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One leg that makes you too vulnerable.</v>

864
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have fortify yourself so that</v>

865
00:50:28.521 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 2>not only can you withstand the pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>of tyranny from the pathological systems</v>

866
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:34.094
<v Speaker 2>that you'll end up involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you can also tolerate the </v>

867
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:41.280
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes of Mother Nature without </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart and,</v>

868
00:50:41.281 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 2>and disintegrating.</v>

869
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.393
<v Speaker 4>Because say you may fall ill or you may </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to grow old and it's the only </v>

870
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 4>thing that'll be,</v>

871
00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly the same problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

872
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:01.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

873
00:51:01.031 --> 00:51:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I know the basic dimensions that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to fortify,</v>

874
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:05.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we actually,</v>

875
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:06.254
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've covered them in the future </v>

876
00:51:06.661 --> 00:51:08.460
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

877
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to lay them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would sort of think about these as</v>

878
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.890
<v Speaker 2>the central elements of human nature in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>

879
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.213
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that is worth </v>

880
00:51:19.441 --> 00:51:20.274
<v Speaker 2>pointing out by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that most utopian schemes admit to </v>

881
00:51:23.131 --> 00:51:25.410
<v Speaker 2>know human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

882
00:51:25.411 --> 00:51:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Because they paused at a certain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>utopia to find that as perfect.</v>

883
00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:30.294
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine that they can build the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being that would fit in that </v>

884
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:34.860
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly what happened among the</v>

885
00:51:34.861 --> 00:51:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also what happened among the radical</v>

886
00:51:37.531 --> 00:51:38.550
<v Speaker 2>left wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:51:38.551 --> 00:51:41.430
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to build the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist man.</v>

888
00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:44.610
<v Speaker 2>And that would be someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unselfish and devoted towards</v>

889
00:51:44.611 --> 00:51:45.150
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

890
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.983
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to build someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unselfish.</v>

892
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:49.651
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

893
00:51:49.651 --> 00:51:51.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a foolish endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

894
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a hubris stick and arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor.</v>

895
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how much selfishness is</v>

896
00:51:56.701 --> 00:51:59.640
<v Speaker 2>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but non is certainly the wrong amount.</v>

897
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:00.503
<v Speaker 2>Like I would say roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should take care of yourself about </v>

898
00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:08.250
<v Speaker 2>as well as you take care of someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's close to you,</v>

899
00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.293
<v Speaker 2>who's best interests you have at heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a moral obligation to </v>

900
00:52:12.811 --> 00:52:13.644
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basic moral obligation you have to </v>

901
00:52:15.061 --> 00:52:15.894
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that on average year as </v>

902
00:52:17.371 --> 00:52:20.790
<v Speaker 2>valuable as everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other individual is on average.</v>

903
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you may have some elements that are</v>

904
00:52:24.781 --> 00:52:27.810
<v Speaker 2>particularity virtuous and some elements</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are particularly,</v>

905
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can contemptible but,</v>

906
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:34.620
<v Speaker 2>and those should be uplifted and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dealt with.</v>

907
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:35.693
<v Speaker 2>But you don't have any right to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you don't have any right </v>

908
00:52:39.391 --> 00:52:40.860
<v Speaker 2>not to take care of yourself.</v>

909
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.693
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to distribute </v>

910
00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:48.450
<v Speaker 2>yourself out so that you're also not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden and being overly selfish.</v>

911
00:52:48.451 --> 00:52:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly one way to to do yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

912
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.433
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also this sort of thing that's </v>

913
00:52:53.431 --> 00:52:56.340
<v Speaker 2>never discussed seriously in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

914
00:52:56.341 --> 00:52:59.670
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to such things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage because we're very,</v>

915
00:52:59.671 --> 00:53:03.990
<v Speaker 2>very immature in our conscious morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>

916
00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:05.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why get married?</v>

917
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.700
<v Speaker 2>This is a question that you attempted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>address.</v>

918
00:53:08.701 --> 00:53:11.310
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the purpose in marriage?</v>

919
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard routine is that,</v>

920
00:53:14.311 --> 00:53:14.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

921
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

922
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 year old girl who still believes in </v>

923
00:53:18.991 --> 00:53:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Unicorns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

924
00:53:20.581 --> 00:53:21.414
<v Speaker 2>it's while you find the love of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and then fundamentally the </v>

925
00:53:23.641 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 2>arrangement is and magic for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

926
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

927
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 2>you live happily ever after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

928
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:31.764
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to that on the </v>

929
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:34.044
<v Speaker 2>mythological plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to think that's not a </v>

930
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of intimate relationship.</v>

931
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so naive and,</v>

932
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.600
<v Speaker 2>and undeveloped that it's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with regards to marriage,</v>

933
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:49.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you some things I know about </v>

934
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:53.790
<v Speaker 2>with regards to keeping a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate relationship together.</v>

935
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:54.803
<v Speaker 2>One is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't lie to your partner and they </v>

936
00:53:58.891 --> 00:54:00.680
<v Speaker 2>can't lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is,</v>

937
00:54:00.681 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 2>is that if you don't know what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

938
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:03.444
<v Speaker 2>you can't adapt to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the person's lying to you or </v>

939
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:07.374
<v Speaker 2>you're lying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither of you are there so you're not </v>

940
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to get anywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

941
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:13.074
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone tells you that the truck is </v>

942
00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 2>broken down when the car isn't working </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go up to fix the truck,</v>

943
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:20.850
<v Speaker 2>that's hardly going to get the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

944
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.253
<v Speaker 2>So we know one of the things we tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>impress on our children when they were </v>

945
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 2>to some chil children always experiment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lying,</v>

947
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:31.044
<v Speaker 2>was that if you lie to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help you because you don't know </v>

948
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 2>what the hell's going on.</v>

949
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>So how the hell can I help you if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what's going on.</v>

950
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.333
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Carl Rogers and his </v>

951
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.693
<v Speaker 2>certainly echoed in the psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 2>community in la at large is that rogers </v>

952
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.793
<v Speaker 2>in particular said the precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a therapeutic relationship is that the </v>

953
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 2>people agree to tell each other the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

954
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Now young took that a step farther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is absolutely brilliant.</v>

955
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:57.444
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a measure of his humility and </v>

956
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 2>genius that he was able to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea.</v>

957
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 2>He said that in order to tell someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

958
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:10.041
<v Speaker 2>you have to tie them to use so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't run away and vice versa.</v>

959
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's the purpose of the marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>bond from,</v>

960
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:13.404
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of psychological </v>

961
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we all have a monster.</v>

962
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.013
<v Speaker 2>We all are monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the person with whom you're </v>

963
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 2>communicating can run away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're ever going to show</v>

964
00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>them what sort of monster you are.</v>

965
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.893
<v Speaker 2>And then there's no way you were ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to learn what sort of monster you </v>

966
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:31.980
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way you're gonna know how</v>

967
00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 2>to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

968
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:34.434
<v Speaker 2>And so part of what's kept me on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight and narrow in so far is that </v>

969
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.900
<v Speaker 2>speed possible during my marriage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

970
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:41.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I'm not getting rid of this </v>

971
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:45.084
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I don't solve the damn </v>

972
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:51.450
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be living it out painfully,</v>

973
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 2>daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekly,</v>

974
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:54.540
<v Speaker 2>monthly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or yearly.</v>

975
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.820
<v Speaker 2>For the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of my life.</v>

976
00:55:56.821 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to imagine that it's like,</v>

977
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:01.141
<v Speaker 2>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

978
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:01.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have this out here right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and now because the alternative is </v>

979
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have this problem forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is she.</v>

980
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the corollary of that is that if I'm</v>

981
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 2>having a problem with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also,</v>

982
00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:15.323
<v Speaker 2>despite my own desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open to the possibility that it's my </v>

983
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>stupidity that's causing it.</v>

984
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.413
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm just going to roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and admit it because I tend to </v>

985
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.264
<v Speaker 2>think I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do allow for the possibility that </v>

986
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:28.924
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if she can convince me that I'm </v>

987
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 2>wrong and sometimes I help her make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

988
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 2>then I want to find out because I also </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to have the problem every day</v>

989
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:38.194
<v Speaker 2>for the next bloody 50 years if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to be my stupidity that's </v>

990
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 2>causing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

991
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:44.044
<v Speaker 2>it's terror and humility that that lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to attempt to find out where I'm </v>

992
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because I'm a good person.</v>

993
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.623
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that it's because I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough that I know enough to know that </v>

994
00:56:56.111 --> 00:56:56.944
<v Speaker 2>if I am blind in some area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get hit by the thing I'm </v>

995
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 2>blind about over and over and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want that.</v>

996
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:05.710
<v Speaker 2>That's partly why I had you guys imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>your catastrophic future.</v>

997
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like you need to know where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go.</v>

998
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.443
<v Speaker 2>I also think that's why cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason why cultures have </v>

999
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 2>always positive heaven and hell or at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least heaven and the underworld,</v>

1000
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 2>because those are real places now what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do met,</v>

1001
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:22.743
<v Speaker 2>met what their reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Metaphysically it's like God only knows </v>

1002
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:29.733
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as actual places that you could </v>

1003
00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 2>inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're,</v>

1004
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to wake up and look to see</v>

1005
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people live in hell,</v>

1006
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them are so deeply embedded.</v>

1007
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:43.054
<v Speaker 2>I like to think of hell as the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>suburb of the underworld and that's the </v>

1008
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:47.524
<v Speaker 2>part where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into chaos and that's the </v>

1009
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 2>underworld and then the chaos in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bidders,</v>

1010
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you and you sink deeper and deeper.</v>

1011
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And when you've got to the spot that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so deep that you can't get out,</v>

1012
00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.353
<v Speaker 2>then you're in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are there all the time </v>

1013
00:58:00.521 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 2>because their lives are so surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos that they can't fix them.</v>

1014
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do not want to be there.</v>

1015
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 2>So young's proposition with marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1016
00:58:10.511 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 2>well there was a variety of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

1017
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1018
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:15.214
<v Speaker 2>he said for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the reason that you ally yourself </v>

1019
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:18.784
<v Speaker 2>with someone is because the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your faults and your virtues won't </v>

1020
00:58:22.991 --> 00:58:23.824
<v Speaker 2>line up is quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like you know you're not going to </v>

1021
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:28.084
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your children aren't going to get a </v>

1022
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:30.424
<v Speaker 2>disease that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that requires two disease genes </v>

1023
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:34.953
<v Speaker 2>generally because the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be a carrier of a particular </v>

1024
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:42.220
<v Speaker 2>mutation and that your partner will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time is quite low.</v>

1025
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the reason why there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual reproduction.</v>

1026
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:50.350
<v Speaker 2>So your errors and your partner's errors</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to match up.</v>

1027
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.333
<v Speaker 2>And so their strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll cover your weaknesses that occurs </v>

1028
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:54.124
<v Speaker 2>at a genetic level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also occurs at the level of </v>

1029
00:58:56.291 --> 00:59:01.240
<v Speaker 2>information exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're lucky where you're weak,</v>

1030
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:02.074
<v Speaker 2>your partner won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now often you see in marriages where </v>

1031
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:04.924
<v Speaker 2>they start to really crumble is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>one person's weakness hits another </v>

1032
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:11.410
<v Speaker 2>person in their weakness and it starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop a positive feedback loop.</v>

1033
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in my marriage for example,</v>

1034
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:18.640
<v Speaker 2>my wife tends to be accusatory and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be guilty and that's,</v>

1035
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 2>that's a difficult thing for us to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1036
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.733
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1037
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.580
<v Speaker 2>now and then it kind of opens up a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a hole,</v>

1038
00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.750
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1039
00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those little positive feedback loops can</v>

1040
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 2>develop all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

1041
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.823
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to build yourself into </v>

1043
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 2>the sort of person who can withstand </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny and not contribute to it and can</v>

1044
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:41.114
<v Speaker 2>keep the adversarial side of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality under control and can </v>

1045
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.470
<v Speaker 2>tolerate tragedy without becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>embittered by it,</v>

1046
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>then you're trying to hammer yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a particular kind of shape.</v>

1047
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that shape is </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximated by figures like horace,</v>

1048
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:56.864
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even more accurately the combination </v>

1049
00:59:58.671 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 2>of horace and no cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way you do that is by rectifying</v>

1050
01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:03.854
<v Speaker 2>your faults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the advantages to having </v>

1051
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:06.674
<v Speaker 2>someone else around is that if you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a dialogue going that's predicated </v>

1052
01:00:10.671 --> 01:00:11.504
<v Speaker 2>on truthful exchange of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can repair your flaws and that </v>

1053
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 2>makes you way tougher and it makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other person way tougher.</v>

1054
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.201
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1055
01:00:20.201 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and there's all sorts of things that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with that that are very good.</v>

1056
01:00:23.211 --> 01:00:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're not cynical,</v>

1057
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.030
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you might say is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you fall in love with someone,</v>

1058
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.333
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed a glimpse of what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be and then that alerts you to </v>

1059
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>that possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just a possibility.</v>

1060
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get there without a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of work.</v>

1061
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.390
<v Speaker 2>So the window opens and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

1062
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Some of that's going to be delusioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on your own,</v>

1063
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faulty viewpoints.</v>

1064
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 2>But controlling for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the window opens up.</v>

1065
01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I think the latent inhibition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripped off for a little while.</v>

1066
01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see the person as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might become.</v>

1067
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:02.503
<v Speaker 2>And then that closes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're careful and you </v>

1068
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:06.374
<v Speaker 2>worked diligently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can start making that </v>

1069
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:09.374
<v Speaker 2>possibility into an actuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's then that the benefit from </v>

1070
01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 2>that is that you do build yourself more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more into the sort of person that is</v>

1071
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:22.120
<v Speaker 2>working for the betterment of reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of four.</v>

1072
01:01:22.121 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 2>It's perversion and destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1073
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I said the ultimate external rang of </v>

1074
01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:31.604
<v Speaker 2>the dom of the value hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like are you going to work to </v>

1075
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:35.054
<v Speaker 2>make being better or worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like the battle between good </v>

1076
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and evil fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's architectural.</v>

1077
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the innermost ring is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1078
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>are you going to manifest a heroic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance in the world,</v>

1079
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.163
<v Speaker 2>which means that your eyes are open and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to take on difficult </v>

1080
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.033
<v Speaker 2>problems and not shy away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or are you going to be primarily </v>

1081
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.544
<v Speaker 2>adversarial in your role and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication between someone who's </v>

1082
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>close to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bond,</v>

1083
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:04.370
<v Speaker 2>and this is why from the union </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1084
01:02:04.371 --> 01:02:05.204
<v Speaker 2>the viral is actually necessary is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't do the God damn work if you can </v>

1085
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 2>run away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very interesting idea.</v>

1086
01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:12.344
<v Speaker 2>I believe it to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it to be true because I think </v>

1087
01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:15.974
<v Speaker 2>in many situations there's no damn way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to reveal what you're like </v>

1088
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 2>to someone unless you know they cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>run away.</v>

1089
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1090
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.460
<v Speaker 2>So partly because it's embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because it's difficult,</v>

1091
01:02:28.461 --> 01:02:30.830
<v Speaker 2>partly because it's frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1092
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's strange too because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently the case,</v>

1093
01:02:33.651 --> 01:02:36.250
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of the union idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadow,</v>

1094
01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:37.084
<v Speaker 2>is that those terrible things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want or even that you've done are </v>

1095
01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>sometimes pointers to parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

1096
01:02:44.241 --> 01:02:48.260
<v Speaker 2>They are incredibly powerful and strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1097
01:02:48.261 --> 01:02:50.810
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1098
01:02:50.811 --> 01:02:51.644
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an archetypal way of looking at </v>

1099
01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:53.954
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I've noticed about </v>

1100
01:02:55.221 --> 01:02:59.450
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is a universal truth,</v>

1101
01:02:59.451 --> 01:03:00.284
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this has to do with the bifurcation </v>

1102
01:03:01.971 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 2>of the feminine archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right on the,</v>

1103
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.493
<v Speaker 2>on the positive and there's basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Virgin Mary on and on the neck off </v>

1104
01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes and on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

1105
01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's like the whore of Babylon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1106
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.330
<v Speaker 2>And so for men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Virgin Mary part,</v>

1107
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 2>his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sister,</v>

1108
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.290
<v Speaker 2>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

1109
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.000
<v Speaker 2>So those are asexual relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationships that are fundamentally</v>

1110
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:32.210
<v Speaker 2>predicated on positive care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's mistress prostitutes,</v>

1111
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.140
<v Speaker 2>stripper over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1112
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:34.974
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all the sexual energy is on the </v>

1113
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 2>negative side now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens with the man is that</v>

1114
01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1115
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 2>because they're not very sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>

1116
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.213
<v Speaker 2>in there</v>

1117
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.120
<v Speaker 2>psychological integration or in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>

1118
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they can tolerate a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's both.</v>

1119
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the negative,</v>

1120
01:03:57.511 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 2>the sexual element contaminates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purity.</v>

1121
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Speaker 2>And so what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men do this to their wives all the time,</v>

1122
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 2>is that every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they get married,</v>

1123
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 2>every time their wife does anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's vaguely sexy,</v>

1124
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 2>they punish her by commission or </v>
<v Speaker 2>omission.</v>

1125
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going out in that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1126
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say that to your wife 20 times,</v>

1127
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:19.703
<v Speaker 2>it's like she's going to be dressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 50 year old peasant in no time </v>

1128
01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1129
01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>because she's going to be not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsive to that,</v>

1130
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.083
<v Speaker 2>it's also very easy to hurt someone if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to the trouble of trying to </v>

1131
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves as attractive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you punish them for that.</v>

1132
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.463
<v Speaker 2>That's a much more effective punishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>than telling them that they're not </v>

1133
01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:41.760
<v Speaker 2>looking very good when they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking very good.</v>

1134
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.770
<v Speaker 2>At least they can expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1135
01:04:43.771 --> 01:04:44.604
<v Speaker 2>It's not polite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to punish them when they're doing </v>

1136
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 2>something that in some sense is virtuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

1137
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:49.871
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neat.</v>

1138
01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 2>You said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to punish someone,</v>

1139
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:54.744
<v Speaker 2>you punish them for their virtues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he meant by that is that's when it </v>

1140
01:04:57.781 --> 01:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>really hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

1141
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would the man do that?</v>

1142
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1143
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>he's uncomfortable with the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

1144
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.333
<v Speaker 2>sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter could have any element of </v>

1145
01:05:07.231 --> 01:05:10.650
<v Speaker 2>sexuality whatsoever because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminates the purity.</v>

1146
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.813
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also his own resentment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and insecurities and the way they </v>

1147
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1148
01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather you were at home fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly and unhappy.</v>

1149
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Then out there potentially attracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>another man.</v>

1150
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's a pretty damn vicious way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

1151
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.953
<v Speaker 2>And all it does eventually is turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>into mutual contempt because the man </v>

1152
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>produces what he's aiming at and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman hates him and no bloody wonder.</v>

1153
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:35.763
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1154
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:37.543
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1155
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>part of you might think like in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1156
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:49.710
<v Speaker 2>because it has to encapsulate sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of demands and desires</v>

1157
01:05:49.711 --> 01:05:52.950
<v Speaker 2>that might manifest itself within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confines of the relationship.</v>

1158
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.383
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the desires that may have </v>

1159
01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to be fulfilled in many cases with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship outside the marriage.</v>

1160
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.333
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be almost a purely sexual </v>

1161
01:06:03.361 --> 01:06:04.194
<v Speaker 2>relationship very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that only becomes necessary when </v>

1162
01:06:07.201 --> 01:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>that isn't allowed and encouraged inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship.</v>

1163
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a very complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1164
01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:15.930
<v Speaker 2>each partner might have to admit to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually want.</v>

1165
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:17.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause people are very unlikely to do </v>

1166
01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:20.820
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid of it and so,</v>

1167
01:06:20.821 --> 01:06:22.770
<v Speaker 2>and they or they think there's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with it.</v>

1168
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Well everything that's powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality included.</v>

1169
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean you only have to know trifle </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Freud to understand that has a </v>

1170
01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:34.980
<v Speaker 2>tremendously dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality and aggression.</v>

1171
01:06:34.981 --> 01:06:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are dangerous.</v>

1172
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:39.810
<v Speaker 2>And part of the way people deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them is they just don't get very good at</v>

1173
01:06:39.811 --> 01:06:41.160
<v Speaker 2>either of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1174
01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And then that's not helpful because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means they're primitively aggressive and</v>

1175
01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:45.414
<v Speaker 2>primitively sexual and then they do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of unsophisticated things at a </v>

1176
01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:50.760
<v Speaker 2>whim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not helpful.</v>

1177
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.840
<v Speaker 2>So all that has to be tangled up inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship too.</v>

1178
01:06:54.841 --> 01:06:56.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

1179
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.060
<v Speaker 2>They'd have an affair when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

1180
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.533
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1181
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Which is often why people get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well really,</v>

1182
01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:13.624
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why people get drunk so </v>

1183
01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 2>they can do stupid things that are fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

1184
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And no wonder because it's fun to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid things that are fun and it's even</v>

1185
01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 2>more fun to do them when you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1186
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.113
<v Speaker 2>But if you're the least bit awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to make sure that you don't put </v>

1187
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 2>yourself in a situation like that at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of maximal temptation.</v>

1188
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.630
<v Speaker 2>And like if you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1189
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.240
<v Speaker 2>you're just waiting for an opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cause trouble.</v>

1190
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:45.420
<v Speaker 3>So those</v>

1191
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:49.343
<v Speaker 2>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that this is </v>

1192
01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>part of the union idea of encountering </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadows.</v>

1193
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to watch what you fantasize </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1194
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.703
<v Speaker 2>Now lots of fantasies look pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're dealing with </v>

1195
01:08:00.901 --> 01:08:01.734
<v Speaker 2>material that has been repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens is that like the </v>

1196
01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:08.910
<v Speaker 2>more sexually unsophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless you are,</v>

1197
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.043
<v Speaker 2>the more resentment is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>tangled up in your fantasy and the more </v>

1198
01:08:12.991 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>extreme that's going to become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.573
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1200
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you work backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give or take.</v>

1201
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.263
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1202
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.621
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1203
01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:24.730
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1204
01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:28.350
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a Friday an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be a catharsis idea.</v>

1205
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Relieving pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would say,</v>

1206
01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:32.980
<v Speaker 2>it's better to think about it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Piagetian perspective,</v>

1207
01:08:32.981 --> 01:08:37.900
<v Speaker 2>which is how do you turn that into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>game that can be played in a sustainable</v>

1208
01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:42.340
<v Speaker 2>manner across large stretches of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>without disrupting your entire life.</v>

1209
01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what part of what that might mean if</v>

1210
01:08:44.561 --> 01:08:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you're an adventurous sort of person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to cause trouble,</v>

1211
01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:48.693
<v Speaker 2>is that you better figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause quite a lot of trouble within the </v>

1212
01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:52.354
<v Speaker 2>confines of your life in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't disrupt the entire structure </v>

1213
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.450
<v Speaker 2>because that's what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need trouble.</v>

1214
01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you were going to marry </v>

1215
01:09:00.971 --> 01:09:02.770
<v Speaker 2>someone who likes trouble and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1216
01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:05.620
<v Speaker 2>away you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Eric Norman,</v>

1217
01:09:05.621 --> 01:09:10.270
<v Speaker 2>who was one of most most apt students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most able students,</v>

1218
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:11.283
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book at the end of the second</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war called depth psychology in a </v>

1219
01:09:14.861 --> 01:09:16.450
<v Speaker 2>new ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in there,</v>

1220
01:09:16.451 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he recommended was </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't try to be better than you are.</v>

1221
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.850
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't mean don't strive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>

1222
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:28.060
<v Speaker 2>He meant that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1223
01:09:28.061 --> 01:09:31.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're having an extremely violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy about your father,</v>

1224
01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:33.670
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so violent,</v>

1225
01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't even want to let it into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

1226
01:09:35.531 --> 01:09:36.364
<v Speaker 2>it's like you better bloody well let </v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing play out and see what it </v>

1227
01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:40.384
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to mean all sorts of </v>

1228
01:09:41.621 --> 01:09:43.540
<v Speaker 2>things that you are not comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1229
01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.213
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1230
01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:46.913
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that the impulse </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's driving that isn't something </v>

1231
01:09:49.951 --> 01:09:50.784
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely necessary for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate so that you can be powerful </v>

1232
01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>enough to survive without being corrupt.</v>

1233
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1234
01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's no joke,</v>

1235
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.303
<v Speaker 2>it's no joke because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've said about the shadow and </v>

1236
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.053
<v Speaker 2>the shadow in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adversarial element of the </v>

1237
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:08.744
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can also be the tyrannical </v>

1238
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 2>element of the state and it can be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological element of Mother Nature to</v>

1239
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 2>those things are all sort of tangled </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1240
01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like your most violent,</v>

1241
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 2>aggressive fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming you have such things,</v>

1242
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:26.090
<v Speaker 2>you can think of them as a manifestation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the dark side of nature.</v>

1243
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.830
<v Speaker 2>That sort of an analogy to Freud's ID.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1244
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.673
<v Speaker 2>or you can think of them as only </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging as a consequence of the fact </v>

1245
01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:36.290
<v Speaker 2>that you are tyrannized by a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is out of kilter.</v>

1246
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
01:10:37.641 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 2>each level of explanation has its </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevance and its place,</v>

1248
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.363
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1249
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.170
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter where you localize the</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse.</v>

1250
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.980
<v Speaker 2>The question is what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1251
01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:00.330
<v Speaker 2>one of niches observations was he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality is cowardice.</v>

1252
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:02.343
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant by that was that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what people claim to be moral virtue </v>

1253
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.863
<v Speaker 2>is merely their fear to do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would actually like to do that </v>

1254
01:11:12.611 --> 01:11:13.444
<v Speaker 2>society would deem inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with morality </v>

1255
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:17.094
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is say I moral not I'm </v>

1256
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:23.010
<v Speaker 2>cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason,</v>

1257
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:23.844
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why people are so attracted to bad guys </v>

1258
01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>crime criminals and serial killers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those sorts of people,</v>

1260
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know that that whole destructive</v>

1261
01:11:36.871 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 2>force is because those</v>

1262
01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:42.523
<v Speaker 2>characters aren't fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just what other people there </v>

1263
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.040
<v Speaker 2>just what people would be like if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't afraid.</v>

1264
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you might say,</v>

1265
01:11:51.291 --> 01:11:52.124
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you act in a manner that isn't </v>

1266
01:11:55.671 --> 01:11:57.980
<v Speaker 2>inhibited by fear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1267
01:11:58.010 --> 01:12:01.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe then you turned into a mafioso or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychopath.</v>

1268
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's not necessarily the </v>

1269
01:12:04.971 --> 01:12:05.804
<v Speaker 2>final element of worship there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's something past that where </v>

1270
01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:12.920
<v Speaker 2>you have those things under your </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

1271
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:14.023
<v Speaker 2>but it's not obvious to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal in certain circumstances isn't </v>

1272
01:12:21.891 --> 01:12:22.724
<v Speaker 2>more moral than the virtuous person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the virtuous person is just </v>

1273
01:12:26.271 --> 01:12:27.104
<v Speaker 2>abstaining because of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all they are is a cowardly </v>

1274
01:12:29.811 --> 01:12:30.644
<v Speaker 2>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know when that's an that's </v>

1275
01:12:33.051 --> 01:12:34.490
<v Speaker 2>an idea that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>

1276
01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.353
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a neat chain idea in some sense </v>

1277
01:12:36.771 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>that was elaborated in large part by </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1278
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1279
01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.870
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask yourself is like if you're in a,</v>

1280
01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're in an organization and someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bullying you,</v>

1281
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 2>what needs to be at your fingertips </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you will stop it?</v>

1282
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:56.103
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough force to stop the person </v>

1283
01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:01.294
<v Speaker 2>from doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to take this same kind </v>

1284
01:13:04.661 --> 01:13:06.700
<v Speaker 2>of forest that in some sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1285
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.140
<v Speaker 2>impulsively violent hell's angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biker is capable of manifesting.</v>

1286
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>all admiring of the hell's angels biker,</v>

1287
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:18.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's not an integrated and </v>

1288
01:13:22.211 --> 01:13:23.044
<v Speaker 2>stable solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also means you shouldn't assume </v>

1289
01:13:27.911 --> 01:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>that your weakness constitutes a virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't,</v>

1290
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.753
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a place of weakness where </v>

1291
01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>degeneracy can flourish.</v>

1292
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:44.780
<v Speaker 3>So the pattern in their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of roles,</v>

1293
01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:58.690
<v Speaker 3>what's sort of the flip side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bifurcation of like Neverland,</v>

1294
01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.373
<v Speaker 3>honor kind of thing and how that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality for women looking at and then </v>

1295
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:13.490
<v Speaker 3>how can we then raised in that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tie furcation can possibly grow up to be</v>

1296
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 3>sort of deposit and or she's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Virgin Mary,</v>

1297
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.244
<v Speaker 3>which is like desirable while also sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of paying homage to the fact that they </v>

1298
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 3>have sexuality.</v>

1299
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's seriously,</v>

1300
01:14:26.731 --> 01:14:31.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would say in some sense that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the prime moral questions.</v>

1301
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.980
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the situation.</v>

1302
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.833
<v Speaker 2>It's like how friendly you should you be</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your husband's friend if you're </v>

1303
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:41.284
<v Speaker 2>attracted to them.</v>

1304
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have to think this through very</v>

1305
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1306
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Because the answer isn't not friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer also listen,</v>

1307
01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800
<v Speaker 2>no sexual provocation whatsoever because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes a huge chunk of the spice out</v>

1308
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:02.074
<v Speaker 2>of human interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be Tz with limits and the </v>

1309
01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:07.954
<v Speaker 2>limits have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very firmly evident and continually </v>

1310
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:14.050
<v Speaker 2>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's fun.</v>

1311
01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:15.813
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your husband had it is any sense and </v>

1312
01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:18.424
<v Speaker 2>he can trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what that means is that the whole </v>

1313
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.043
<v Speaker 2>energy of the whole situation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is elevated big part of it because </v>

1314
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to deny sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>attraction.</v>

1315
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 2>The question is what the hell do you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it?</v>

1316
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.030
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you,</v>

1317
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.750
<v Speaker 2>you make it subservient to the greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole and that,</v>

1318
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and you have to decide what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been talking about that to,</v>

1319
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.213
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I already mentioned today what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being you should aspire to be.</v>

1321
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:50.223
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be someone who can stand up </v>

1322
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.440
<v Speaker 2>in the face of tragedy and tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own appalling lack of virtue.</v>

1323
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1324
01:15:57.521 --> 01:16:00.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wonderful thing to aim at for,</v>

1325
01:16:00.301 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 2>for all sorts of self evident reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>

1326
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:04.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you tangle sexuality up into </v>

1327
01:16:05.531 --> 01:16:06.221
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1328
01:16:06.221 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 2>not by repressing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say by using it as a,</v>

1329
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.863
<v Speaker 2>as a sophisticated ability and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes practice and it takes </v>

1330
01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 2>encouragement and it takes attention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision and it also takes the willingness</v>

1331
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:21.184
<v Speaker 2>of your partner to allow that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not going to happen without </v>

1332
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:25.714
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not going to happen without </v>

1333
01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.313
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a funny thing because what that </v>

1334
01:16:30.821 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 2>means that is honesty and trust opens up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the door to gains.</v>

1335
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're good enough at those games,</v>

1336
01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:40.180
<v Speaker 2>you might not have to go outside of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship for excitement.</v>

1337
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to get enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement exactly where you are</v>

1338
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:50.100
<v Speaker 3>and question a bit of a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see you're out in the more,</v>

1339
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 3>more often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1340
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.580
<v Speaker 3>are those people in a way doing the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing but with [inaudible]?</v>

1341
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just delusional.</v>

1342
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any evidence </v>

1343
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Soever I've never seen anyone in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship like that who's actually,</v>

1344
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>who actually has a clue about </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

1345
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.293
<v Speaker 2>There's delusion and somewhere in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the friends with benefits </v>

1346
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 2>arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1347
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>

1348
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1349
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:27.284
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it presumes that you can detach </v>

1350
01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>sexuality from emotional commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean every 16 year old,</v>

1351
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:37.850
<v Speaker 2>what admirer of porn believes that or </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to believe it,</v>

1352
01:17:37.851 --> 01:17:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's not in the least bit true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could it be?</v>

1353
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:46.450
<v Speaker 2>So then it's also predicated on the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that both partners are equally committed</v>

1354
01:17:47.031 --> 01:17:49.130
<v Speaker 2>and attracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's never true.</v>

1355
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.820
<v Speaker 2>One person is always way more attracted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like that.</v>

1356
01:17:52.821 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Then the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't want to admit it,</v>

1357
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the idea that you can </v>

1358
01:17:58.221 --> 01:17:59.054
<v Speaker 2>have a friendship and introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality into it and it's still a </v>

1359
01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no that's not right.</v>

1360
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the levels of naivety that,</v>

1361
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:11.590
<v Speaker 2>that are underneath the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that could be possible is</v>

1362
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:14.480
<v Speaker 2>mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1363
01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.920
<v Speaker 4>so this is fairly common.</v>

1364
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is stupidity,</v>

1365
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean with your generation in </v>

1366
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1367
01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:24.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1368
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I certainly like people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger people as being more foolish and</v>

1369
01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 2>self obsessed than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby boomers.</v>

1370
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:32.684
<v Speaker 2>But you can bloody well forget that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the most self obsessed generation </v>

1371
01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:36.130
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

1372
01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:38.710
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't saying that it's common as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>justification.</v>

1373
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.800
<v Speaker 4>That as a segue to the question of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would advise for some people.</v>

1374
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing is is people are deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused about relationships and it's no</v>

1375
01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.970
<v Speaker 2>bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1376
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:47.953
<v Speaker 2>the reason they're confused about </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships is because of the birth </v>

1377
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 2>control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1378
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 2>that's a biological mutation of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of massive proportions,</v>

1379
01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:56.984
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the biggest biological </v>

1380
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:03.611
<v Speaker 2>event that hit the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hit that hit animal life.</v>

1381
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Ever since sexuality evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big deal.</v>

1382
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:08.563
<v Speaker 2>Like no female creatures I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary control over the reproductive </v>

1383
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:13.940
<v Speaker 2>status before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1384
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.943
<v Speaker 2>and it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that only happened in 1960 it's like </v>

1385
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that's yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a blink of an eye.</v>

1386
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody's trying to sort that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1387
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows what the hell to do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1388
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with autonomous women?</v>

1389
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:27.583
<v Speaker 2>They're annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're interesting and attractive and </v>

1390
01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:30.794
<v Speaker 2>they do all sorts of bizarre things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're so damn complicated that </v>

1391
01:19:33.261 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1392
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:39.470
<v Speaker 2>And neither do men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's struggling along with how</v>

1393
01:19:39.471 --> 01:19:40.304
<v Speaker 2>to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that all gets contaminated </v>

1394
01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:43.244
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1395
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.630
<v Speaker 2>stupid wish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment,</v>

1396
01:19:44.631 --> 01:19:45.464
<v Speaker 2>resentment and ignorance and willful </v>
<v Speaker 2>blindness and general stupidity and to </v>

1397
01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:49.940
<v Speaker 2>produce all sorts of,</v>

1398
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1399
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Completely harmful solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1400
01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we could go,</v>

1401
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:01.303
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back a little bit and let's go </v>

1402
01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 2>back to those dimensions of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because you guys can argue this out</v>

1403
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:06.531
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1404
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfectly happy to,</v>

1405
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:09.510
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hear what you have to say.</v>

1406
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.553
<v Speaker 2>What I've observed is that in order for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to have enough pillars underneath </v>

1407
01:20:15.781 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to be knocked out</v>

1408
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 2>by a single event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>

1409
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And single events that are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking you out are on their way.</v>

1410
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:24.653
<v Speaker 2>Some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt have already experienced them </v>

1411
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be many of them in your</v>

1412
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need friends.</v>

1413
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an open question.</v>

1414
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:35.383
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is the wrong number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for men because it turns out </v>

1415
01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:41.880
<v Speaker 2>that men without friends seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappier than women without friends.</v>

1416
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.103
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean women don't need </v>

1417
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:45.234
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

1418
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>You need an intimate relationship of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort,</v>

1419
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say in the absence of a </v>

1420
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:52.944
<v Speaker 2>better theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do it traditionally because </v>

1421
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.710
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spin out of your own experience,</v>

1422
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 2>a solution that's better on average than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the traditional solution is zero.</v>

1423
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:08.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the lifespan to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unless you get really lucky,</v>

1424
01:21:08.011 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you know and stumbled into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very unlikely you need,</v>

1425
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.103
<v Speaker 2>you need to do something that's of </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to the collective and it's </v>

1426
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:19.050
<v Speaker 2>reciprocally beneficial to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's usually a job.</v>

1427
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Or if you're lucky it's a career which </v>
<v Speaker 2>would even be better.</v>

1428
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:27.530
<v Speaker 2>You need a family of some sort because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you're just too isolated.</v>

1429
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:28.763
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that probably is going to involve </v>

1430
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:36.120
<v Speaker 2>children and I think children are </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 30% of life,</v>

1431
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:39.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be 50% of life,</v>

1432
01:21:39.031 --> 01:21:39.864
<v Speaker 2>but there's certainly 30% you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what you're going to do with </v>

1433
01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:47.040
<v Speaker 2>your time outs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your own private time.</v>

1434
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You need to figure out what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with that,</v>

1435
01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:52.220
<v Speaker 2>that's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1436
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.153
<v Speaker 2>and you have to watch your health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that partly means making sure that </v>

1437
01:21:56.221 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't fall down various drug and </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol abuse holes.</v>

1438
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.653
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you keep yourself relatively </v>

1439
01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:02.724
<v Speaker 2>intact and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's everything you </v>

1440
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're missing any one of those,</v>

1441
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:08.483
<v Speaker 2>then you're weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could probably miss one or even </v>

1442
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:14.070
<v Speaker 2>two of those who still be fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1443
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.353
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think you need to stand </v>

1444
01:22:16.351 --> 01:22:19.170
<v Speaker 2>on six legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you certainly need to stand on three</v>

1445
01:22:19.171 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 2>or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I would suggest</v>

1446
01:22:22.531 --> 01:22:23.364
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say also learned this from </v>

1447
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.770
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is do not deviate in too many directions</v>

1448
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:29.604
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lucky if you can deviate in one </v>

1449
01:22:32.131 --> 01:22:34.380
<v Speaker 2>direction without blowing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

1450
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you deviate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're in a chaotic domain.</v>

1451
01:22:37.741 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And there might be a lot of possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1452
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:40.783
<v Speaker 2>There are no doubt is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you can tolerate that </v>

1453
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:47.700
<v Speaker 2>is it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's unlikely.</v>

1454
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why most people are conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>

1455
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 2>so then the next issue in part is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1456
01:22:55.831 --> 01:22:57.690
<v Speaker 2>how do you meld all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

1457
01:22:57.691 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why I told you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ph Eddie and ideas.</v>

1458
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to do is to produce a</v>

1459
01:23:05.441 --> 01:23:10.441
<v Speaker 2>sustainable game that can be implemented</v>
<v Speaker 2>across large sections of time.</v>

1460
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>That's not an inhibitory model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1461
01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:14.134
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean while you should just </v>
<v Speaker 2>crush your regression or crush your </v>

1462
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it doesn't even mean that they should</v>

1463
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 2>be sublimated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Friday and alternative.</v>

1464
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.054
<v Speaker 2>What it means is that those capabilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be made sophisticated so that </v>

1465
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in play all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1466
01:23:28.721 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Speaker 2>So if you see somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and aggressive,</v>

1467
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:35.140
<v Speaker 2>they are aggressive all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always in everything they do.</v>

1468
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1469
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:38.410
<v Speaker 2>it's more like power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1470
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not impulsive Dick Damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an,</v>

1471
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:44.790
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have at hand,</v>

1472
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 2>partly because it enables you to say no </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need to be able to say no.</v>

1473
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a slave</v>

1474
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.393
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1475
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.940
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might ask,</v>

1476
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:56.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do those problems get solved?</v>

1477
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I can tell you is that</v>

1478
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:00.183
<v Speaker 2>marital union is a human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the probability that something like </v>

1479
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:09.030
<v Speaker 2>that is the right solution is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>canonical.</v>

1480
01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1481
01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:13.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can find a better solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't count on it.</v>

1482
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:17.913
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1483
01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.053
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's other things that people </v>

1484
01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:22.434
<v Speaker 2>don't take into account that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly because I think that </v>

1485
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 2>we refuse to admit them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1486
01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.740
<v Speaker 2>the temporal course of life is radically</v>
<v Speaker 2>different for women than it is for men.</v>

1487
01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 2>And men have a much larger horizon to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play around with and women do.</v>

1488
01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.480
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1489
01:24:39.481 --> 01:24:41.490
<v Speaker 2>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have friends who got married when</v>

1490
01:24:41.491 --> 01:24:43.350
<v Speaker 2>they were in their late fifties and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1491
01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:45.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1492
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:48.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not that uncommon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
01:24:48.061 --> 01:24:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1494
01:24:50.101 --> 01:24:50.934
<v Speaker 2>both the one man I'm thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he married a woman from the third world </v>

1495
01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:55.403
<v Speaker 2>and he treats her far better than she </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever expected to be treated by anyone </v>

1496
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:00.983
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have a child and he is </v>

1497
01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:05.880
<v Speaker 2>absolutely dotes on the child and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything seems to be working out fine.</v>

1498
01:25:06.210 --> 01:25:08.490
<v Speaker 2>But as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an option for women.</v>

1499
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.133
<v Speaker 2>And so women have to solve most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems in life before they're 40 </v>

1500
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:14.183
<v Speaker 2>probably before they're 35 and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real problem and no one talks about </v>

1501
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:19.714
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one will admit to the existence of </v>

1502
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:21.544
<v Speaker 2>that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the reason I'm saying that is </v>

1503
01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:25.654
<v Speaker 2>because what that means is that women </v>
<v Speaker 2>have less time to experiment with </v>

1504
01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:28.954
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>

1505
01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1506
01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.133
<v Speaker 2>Modes of sexual being than men do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the price they paid for losing </v>

1507
01:25:34.621 --> 01:25:38.070
<v Speaker 2>the time during the experimentation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibitively high.</v>

1508
01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Not that I would say that this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are obviously exceptions,</v>

1509
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:46.043
<v Speaker 3>but just think about in some ways it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>better that women kind of pop this </v>

1510
01:25:53.391 --> 01:25:54.224
<v Speaker 3>limited opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I have one friend who's 29 years </v>

1511
01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.150
<v Speaker 3>different and she resentenced her mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much for it.</v>

1512
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:05.370
<v Speaker 3>And that's probably what her father</v>

1513
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you think because of the age difference.</v>

1514
01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:08.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she died when she was 10 so men </v>

1515
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:12.063
<v Speaker 3>can still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you're on your deathbed </v>

1516
01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.860
<v Speaker 3>you can probably still have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't.</v>

1517
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.753
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that kind of a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because even though so many people have </v>

1518
01:26:22.241 --> 01:26:25.330
<v Speaker 3>kids when they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least women,</v>

1519
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:28.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a weird argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1520
01:26:28.201 --> 01:26:29.034
<v Speaker 3>I mean like antifeminist but at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>women eventually stop having that </v>

1521
01:26:33.161 --> 01:26:33.994
<v Speaker 3>opportunity thing.</v>

1522
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.133
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel like you're opening up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger question and one of the bigger </v>

1523
01:26:42.311 --> 01:26:45.790
<v Speaker 2>questions that you're opening up is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility of radical limitations.</v>

1524
01:26:46.930 --> 01:26:51.070
<v Speaker 2>So people always assume that more choice</v>
<v Speaker 2>is better.</v>

1525
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.473
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of the reason that modern </v>

1526
01:26:55.031 --> 01:26:55.864
<v Speaker 2>people torture themselves to death is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their horizon of choice is </v>

1527
01:26:58.331 --> 01:27:00.910
<v Speaker 2>staggeringly large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What should I do?</v>

1528
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1529
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.330
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to dress a three year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

1530
01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.740
<v Speaker 2>the three year old says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to pick what I'm going to wear.</v>

1531
01:27:08.741 --> 01:27:10.770
<v Speaker 2>But then the three year old looks in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>closet,</v>

1532
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck.</v>

1533
01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.133
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you lay out two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have two options of closing on the bed </v>

1534
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:20.470
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want this one or that one?</v>

1535
01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:22.900
<v Speaker 2>And they're perfectly happy cause they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to choose.</v>

1536
01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.093
<v Speaker 2>But the choice horizon isn't so large </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is anxiety producing in and of </v>

1537
01:27:28.421 --> 01:27:29.254
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is some utility in tight </v>

1538
01:27:31.091 --> 01:27:33.010
<v Speaker 2>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1539
01:27:33.011 --> 01:27:33.844
<v Speaker 2>it's something to actually meditate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the fact that life </v>

1540
01:27:36.341 --> 01:27:38.620
<v Speaker 2>itself is finite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1541
01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:40.680
<v Speaker 2>because people don't like that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1542
01:27:40.681 --> 01:27:42.760
<v Speaker 2>well wouldn't it be better if we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>live forever?</v>

1543
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:43.623
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1544
01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:50.370
<v Speaker 2>are not that fond of the idea that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be here in 40 years.</v>

1545
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't absolutely obvious to me to</v>

1546
01:27:56.551 --> 01:27:57.384
<v Speaker 2>what degree that should be extended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it was whether or not that would </v>

1547
01:28:00.031 --> 01:28:02.730
<v Speaker 2>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then that,</v>

1548
01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:05.820
<v Speaker 2>that brings up the deeper question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>

1549
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.633
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1550
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:10.103
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are limited and the fact that </v>

1551
01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:13.614
<v Speaker 2>they exist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a relationship between </v>

1552
01:28:16.651 --> 01:28:19.140
<v Speaker 2>limitations in existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1553
01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:23.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're playing chess because there</v>

1554
01:28:23.491 --> 01:28:24.324
<v Speaker 2>are rules to playing chess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that those rules are there </v>

1555
01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:30.600
<v Speaker 2>and that there limits means that you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play chess.</v>

1556
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1557
01:28:32.101 --> 01:28:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Because what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've done is taking a large field</v>

1558
01:28:34.921 --> 01:28:35.754
<v Speaker 2>of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could play any game and you're </v>

1559
01:28:38.401 --> 01:28:38.911
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1560
01:28:38.911 --> 01:28:41.550
<v Speaker 2>here's 10 arbitrary rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Poof,</v>

1561
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.533
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden there's an actual game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can play that has virtually </v>

1562
01:28:45.511 --> 01:28:48.660
<v Speaker 2>infinite possibility in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about that.</v>

1563
01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.093
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems to me that like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constrained potential and that unless </v>

1564
01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:58.200
<v Speaker 2>the constraints were there along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential,</v>

1565
01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:00.930
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be any way of actualizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1566
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 2>You know that the root where genius </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from Jeanie</v>

1567
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.193
<v Speaker 2>and a genie is this magical thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do anything except it's cramped </v>

1568
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:17.040
<v Speaker 2>right up in this little tiny container.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's this weird combination of divine</v>

1569
01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:21.810
<v Speaker 2>possibility and stringent limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what human beings are like.</v>

1570
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 2>And they complain about the limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack or limitation might be a creek.</v>

1571
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I think limitation is a precondition for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

1572
01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the issue is,</v>

1573
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:33.683
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if limitation is a precondition for </v>

1574
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:35.934
<v Speaker 2>being how best to handle the limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that's the central </v>

1575
01:29:40.561 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>question of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the,</v>

1576
01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:43.763
<v Speaker 2>the point you're making is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's not such a bad thing to </v>

1577
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 2>have a time horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I would say,</v>

1578
01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:52.470
<v Speaker 2>well it depends on what you do about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time horizon.</v>

1579
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.863
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really torture is modern people is the </v>

1580
01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:01.550
<v Speaker 2>availability of divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1581
01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1582
01:30:03.241 --> 01:30:05.940
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will ask themselves,</v>

1583
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a relationship I should be here?</v>

1584
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1585
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 2>try finding a relationship where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't ask that question.</v>

1586
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 2>You want to be tortured by that question</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of your life,</v>

1587
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:22.410
<v Speaker 2>or do you want to just solve it once and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do something else?</v>

1588
01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.050
<v Speaker 2>While that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough question,</v>

1589
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:26.663
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it's better to solve it </v>
<v Speaker 2>once and then to move on to other </v>

1590
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.524
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1591
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't think that's something</v>

1592
01:30:38.201 --> 01:30:39.550
<v Speaker 2>to aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1593
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they don't think people do.</v>

1594
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:46.670
<v Speaker 2>But you can make a case that if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an escape route,</v>

1595
01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't sacrifice everything to making</v>
<v Speaker 2>it work.</v>

1596
01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:54.893
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you can make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage work without sacrificing </v>

1597
01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:59.310
<v Speaker 2>everything to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too hard.</v>

1598
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And so if you leave open the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have to commit to it.</v>

1599
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:08.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't actually have to commit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't commit to it,</v>

1600
01:31:08.401 --> 01:31:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1601
01:31:11.581 --> 01:31:12.414
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be tortured by the </v>

1602
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:16.320
<v Speaker 2>possibility that you could.</v>

1603
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.823
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1604
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:21.361
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1605
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:22.570
<v Speaker 2>It's if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1606
01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.840
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1607
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1608
01:31:25.861 --> 01:31:26.694
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also not saying the divorce </v>

1609
01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:29.664
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I think the fact that we </v>

1610
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:31.974
<v Speaker 2>casually introduced it into our culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late 1960s was an absolute </v>

1611
01:31:35.041 --> 01:31:35.874
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all the evidence suggests that </v>

1612
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:38.904
<v Speaker 2>because what's happened now is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only people who get married and stay </v>

1613
01:31:42.601 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 2>married are rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1614
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you guys know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1615
01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:50.880
<v Speaker 2>if you stratify society by socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>

1616
01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:52.133
<v Speaker 2>it's the middle class and above have </v>
<v Speaker 2>long lasting permanent marriages and </v>

1617
01:31:56.131 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 2>usually have children within them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Below that,</v>

1618
01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:04.700
<v Speaker 2>it's serial relationships usually have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unfulfilling kind,</v>

1619
01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.393
<v Speaker 2>single motherhood and excess poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost all for women because </v>

1620
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 2>women almost always have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost always have young,</v>

1621
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:18.370
<v Speaker 2>the young children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're granted custody or it just works</v>

1622
01:32:18.371 --> 01:32:19.204
<v Speaker 2>out that way in the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't obvious to me by any means </v>

1623
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever that that's constituted an </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement for the majority of children</v>

1624
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:29.340
<v Speaker 2>or the majority of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1625
01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.273
<v Speaker 2>well for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's constantly didn't </v>

1626
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:36.570
<v Speaker 2>improvement for the majority of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now these are all I'm,</v>

1627
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:38.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1628
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not stating these as facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stating them as observations.</v>

1629
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:44.570
<v Speaker 2>This is how it is appeared to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1630
01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:51.230
<v Speaker 2>some things you have to be all in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1631
01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1632
01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Or you can't get what they might offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't hedge your bet.</v>

1633
01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:00.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already said that.</v>

1634
01:33:00.321 --> 01:33:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive on your own.</v>

1635
01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I think you're actually more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the kind of partner who can battle in</v>

1636
01:33:08.781 --> 01:33:12.200
<v Speaker 2>a relationship if you could live on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>

1637
01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.630
<v Speaker 2>because then you can say no.</v>

1638
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:18.063
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1639
01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1640
01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1641
01:33:21.571 --> 01:33:24.960
<v Speaker 2>so let's take a break and then I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>read you something.</v>

1642
01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I want to go through a story with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's take a break for 10 minutes.</v>
