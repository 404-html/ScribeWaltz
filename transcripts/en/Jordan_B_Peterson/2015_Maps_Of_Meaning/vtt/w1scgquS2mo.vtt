1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Turns into Durga if you treat her </v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.443
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't use dirt because I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that I actually got accused by </v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>someone being a racist because I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It was quite funny because they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.253
<v Speaker 1>you use the into orders to indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos in the Greco Roman goddess to </v>

6
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:15.954
<v Speaker 1>indicate benevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was obviously an indication of </v>

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>life fundamental pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.363
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to show that the idea </v>

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>of the benevolent God isn't limited to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single culture.</v>

10
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Diana,</v>

11
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>she's got a lot of breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's,</v>

12
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.723
<v Speaker 1>that's what's down in front there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's like the nourishing element of </v>

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.293
<v Speaker 1>being the best way to think about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nourishing element of being emerges </v>

14
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.004
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the differentiation of the </v>

15
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So way at the back there's the predatory</v>

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>serpent chaos that lurks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

17
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And then that fragments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll did one more differentiated.</v>

18
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So I would in one direction into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and the Feminine.</v>

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>This is a tough one because there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird interaction here with,</v>

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>with gender and archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about,</v>

22
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm floundering on this because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time because it's very </v>

24
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.114
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which gender of person are you most </v>

25
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>likely to see on the cover of men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine?</v>

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.833
<v Speaker 1>A woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gender and most likely to see on the </v>

27
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>cover of Woman's magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

28
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

29
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why I think that's why.</v>

30
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.243
<v Speaker 1>And that means that they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by the same archetype in a </v>

31
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:52.784
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the archetype is the architect will </v>

32
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>feminine fundamentally and for Women The</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal feminine is a judge and a and</v>

33
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judge is,</v>

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far do you deviate from that?</v>

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>The ideal is to what degree can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulate?</v>

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And then from them it's the same damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

37
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>The judge elements exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the possession element,</v>

38
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>while it's slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that different,</v>

39
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's a strange thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual image,</v>

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>general digital images that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.103
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strange because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the architectural structures were the </v>

43
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>same men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of it,</v>

44
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the way I've tried to figure this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the sun is the sun,</v>

45
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the like the mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the shining sun,</v>

46
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.324
<v Speaker 1>although it's also that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women obviously have an element of </v>

47
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>them that can be heroic and adversarial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like man.</v>

48
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.033
<v Speaker 1>But then in women that's complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other primary elements of </v>

49
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>their Ba is the maternal feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.993
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's complicated because women or </v>

51
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>men can also be quite maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for mammals,</v>

52
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.873
<v Speaker 1>predatory mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandarin unbelievably nurturing and </v>

53
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No grizzly bears.</v>

54
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>We just eat our own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

55
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.153
<v Speaker 1>So men are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite feminine as well as being </v>

56
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda think of it this way.</v>

57
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:11.824
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your archetipal personality structure </v>

58
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for men.</v>

59
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>The hero is at the forefront and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

60
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>the feminine modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restorative behind that.</v>

61
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And for women it's reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Feminine Mother is sort of forefront</v>

62
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and the heroes behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both of the archetypes are,</v>

63
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are operative.</v>

64
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think about that.</v>

65
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what you make of it.</v>

66
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.093
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

67
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he might say,</v>

68
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>well why would women isn't reasonable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppose that for women,</v>

69
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the feminine represents the unknown just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he does for man.</v>

70
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.323
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it is just like it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>for men because I think for women </v>

71
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.723
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of the patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that's more unknown Mathius </v>

72
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.370
<v Speaker 1>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and I think you see the reaction to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part,</v>

74
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you see the reaction to that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist movement because the patriarchy</v>

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>is like the tyrannical father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.343
<v Speaker 1>and the patriarchy exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the tyrannical father is </v>

77
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>not the entire substrate of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just ridiculous.</v>

78
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think because women are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>in some sense they're outsiders to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>male dominance hierarchy,</v>

80
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.453
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

81
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.343
<v Speaker 1>the male dominance hierarchy is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated by the unknown for women </v>

82
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:30.614
<v Speaker 1>than it is for math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's more likely to be </v>

83
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as the tyrannical father </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

84
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.773
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't exactly sorted out because he </v>

85
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.000
<v Speaker 1>ended up with nest problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>so in so far as your primary mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being as feminine,</v>

87
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.910
<v Speaker 1>then your secondary motor being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

88
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.193
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of something masculine </v>

89
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and all the characteristics of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

90
00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but the manner in which they manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

91
00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:54.974
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be different and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't sort that out too damn </v>

92
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:57.584
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I think that that is what we're </v>

93
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>sorting out right now in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.260
<v Speaker 1>ever since women got the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control their reproductive function,</v>

95
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.333
<v Speaker 1>which was probably at least in part a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of an aide prior </v>

96
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>psychological transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the pill for women,</v>

98
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.583
<v Speaker 1>but then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what was the precondition for </v>

99
00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:21.320
<v Speaker 1>creating a society in which the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who invented the pill didn't get killed.</v>

100
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Catholic church,</v>

101
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not happy.</v>

102
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>We build was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

103
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:26.894
<v Speaker 1>not happy and no wonder know sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there had to be some shifting </v>

104
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.353
<v Speaker 1>in the underlying conceptual landscape </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the relationship </v>

105
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:36.674
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that invention to even have come </v>

106
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I think you can really see that starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if you read the classic Russian and</v>

108
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.304
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that push towards equality </v>

109
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>to characterize women was really alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well in 19th century Russia.</v>

110
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm on mirrors to call aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know like it,</v>

111
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.183
<v Speaker 1>it has a pretty lengthy history that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated a wiping of gender </v>

112
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>differences across western countries.</v>

113
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Meet the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

114
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.593
<v Speaker 1>the waning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean that widening of personality </v>

115
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.154
<v Speaker 1>differences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So big five differences are wider and </v>

116
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>more here and countries and depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>of incidents.</v>

117
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to answer that.</v>

118
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:17.384
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is that if you look at </v>

119
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.290
<v Speaker 1>personality differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the modern world,</v>

120
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the most egalitarian cultures have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest personality differences,</v>

121
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.384
<v Speaker 1>the gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the technical reason for that is </v>

122
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:29.744
<v Speaker 1>all the environmental variability has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been eliminated and so all that's left </v>

123
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.284
<v Speaker 1>is genetic variability and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not masked in some sense by </v>

124
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the environmental variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's powerful and profound,</v>

125
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely shows that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of powerful genetic variability.</v>

126
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Definitely it's powerful evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

127
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also could be,</v>

128
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.523
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily fit what you're aiming for </v>

129
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The galitary in society is the right for</v>

130
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone to be different in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

131
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>and obviously that's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited,</v>

133
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>right to some degree.</v>

134
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.153
<v Speaker 1>So any galitary and society wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily eradicate personality </v>

135
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:10.994
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a bloody totalitarian </v>

136
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get rid of all the differences.</v>

137
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you're a female and </v>

138
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>

139
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and I mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have to be the same,</v>

140
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to be a function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased tense.</v>

141
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>What would you call control on the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the state?</v>

142
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that that's intrinsic,</v>

143
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it's intrinsic.</v>

144
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I would be very hesitant to say not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean let's,</v>

145
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>let's be real about this</v>

146
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.060
<v Speaker 3>additionally complicated because </v>
<v Speaker 3>architects like they're universally,</v>

147
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 3>but you understand both the female and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the male president.</v>

148
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I know you understand and as personality</v>
<v Speaker 3>traits,</v>

149
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.413
<v Speaker 3>the masculine stereotypical traits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine stereotypical traits across </v>

150
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 3>genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people,</v>

151
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.740
<v Speaker 3>any person have you done there can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>this as much or whatever,</v>

152
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 3>like they're not opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so wondering if it's complicated because</v>

153
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:17.351
<v Speaker 3>any individual person that is manifested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in parts of both at once in some.</v>

154
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.933
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely.</v>

155
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.483
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a prerequisite for </v>

156
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>longterm relationships between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

157
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we weren't a lot the same or at least</v>

158
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:30.034
<v Speaker 1>capable of being the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we will be able to understand each </v>

159
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>other at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:34.731
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we,</v>

161
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:35.564
<v Speaker 1>if we do what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do more than other creatures that </v>

162
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.820
<v Speaker 1>have our complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

163
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

164
00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:42.414
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that if you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a given individual and you look at </v>

165
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:49.330
<v Speaker 1>the variability of their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leighton's behavior,</v>

166
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.943
<v Speaker 1>the variability within a person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally greater than the average </v>

167
00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>variability within the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

168
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an extrovert,</v>

169
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you can be extremely introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not very many extroverts at</v>

170
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.834
<v Speaker 1>a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the noisiest people at a funeral </v>

171
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.823
<v Speaker 1>will be the extroverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are going to be hard to be </v>

172
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:10.750
<v Speaker 1>noisy at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>and an introvert can find themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation where they can't shut up.</v>

174
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.863
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of inter individual </v>

175
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that one of the indexes</v>

176
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.963
<v Speaker 1>of psychological health is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximizations of individual variability </v>

177
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>because you should be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely compassionate,</v>

178
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with a sick baby and</v>

179
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>extremely uncompassionate when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with someone who's,</v>

180
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using their illness as an excuse not to </v>

181
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>pull their own weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need both of those.</v>

182
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

183
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.773
<v Speaker 1>you'll end up with an average point as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of your genetic structure </v>

184
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>and maybe your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your socialization and sort of up to you</v>

185
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.154
<v Speaker 1>to widen yourself all across the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum so that you can call and those </v>

186
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:54.594
<v Speaker 1>abilities when it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of what </v>

187
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 1>differentiation as a person actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

188
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

189
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.183
<v Speaker 1>you come to be able to do more things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can match yourself much more </v>

190
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>carefully to the immediate demands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation.</v>

191
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the questions.</v>

192
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

193
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>the assemble for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

194
00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>normally the feminine differentiates </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the negative feminine,</v>

195
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.483
<v Speaker 1>the positive feminine part of the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>is how do you get more of the positive </v>

196
00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and keep the negative that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

197
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.563
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a question that people have to </v>

198
00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:33.364
<v Speaker 1>ask themselves at the personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual at that level of the </v>

199
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 1>individual interaction with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with themselves.</v>

200
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 1>But then it also works as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the unknown and nature</v>

201
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:44.674
<v Speaker 1>as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because in some ways those are the </v>

202
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.800
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

203
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a differentiation.</v>

204
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.643
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the relationship between the </v>

205
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:56.674
<v Speaker 1>hero archetype in the feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you have here is the chaos </v>

206
00:10:58.931 --> 00:11:01.300
<v Speaker 1>dragon differentiating itself into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

207
00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>which is half positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half negative,</v>

208
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.563
<v Speaker 1>and the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being manifested in the form of </v>

209
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.683
<v Speaker 1>the Virgin Mary with Christ on her lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw at the same representation when </v>

210
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:12.154
<v Speaker 1>we were looking at Isis and horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's really quite cool about that </v>

211
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.480
<v Speaker 1>as you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's surrounded by this,</v>

212
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.120
<v Speaker 1>this matador law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

213
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.043
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almond shaped</v>

215
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.003
<v Speaker 1>opening fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see this as something that </v>

216
00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:29.650
<v Speaker 1>renaissance artists get a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see along the edges of the Mandurah,</v>

217
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.523
<v Speaker 1>there's all these little baby hits that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are popping up with wings on them and </v>

218
00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>those are called Pootie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's very common that when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of married with,</v>

220
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.483
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cosmos sort of billowing out </v>

221
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:42.274
<v Speaker 1>behind her because that's what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a whole into time and space </v>

222
00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 1>that there's all these potential beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are surrounding,</v>

223
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:48.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's these little baby heads with </v>

224
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:51.311
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

225
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

226
00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>what this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:55.354
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a museum in New York where a </v>

228
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.300
<v Speaker 1>number of renaissance paintings of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>type were,</v>

229
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>were arrayed in this one room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a rude word,</v>

230
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>affiliate donors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazy Room.</v>

231
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.483
<v Speaker 1>And there are people from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they're looking at these damn </v>

232
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.000
<v Speaker 1>paintings.</v>

233
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

234
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.104
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's married and she's sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the moon and there's a bunch of like </v>

235
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.450
<v Speaker 1>winged baby heads around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's that all about?</v>

236
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's looking at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

237
00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really something to this.</v>

238
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you've kept them on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and you say,</v>

239
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.753
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you travel from like Cincinnati </v>

240
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:27.754
<v Speaker 1>to come to this museum to look like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who he don't even believe in </v>

241
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.840
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the Chris Moon surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby hands?</v>

242
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why they're there.</v>

243
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.500
<v Speaker 1>They're fascinated by the painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

244
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If life interrupts a reasons,</v>

245
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:44.584
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice how absurd it is </v>

246
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>until you take the picture of a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are these things,</v>

247
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.770
<v Speaker 1>these Pootie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I think what they are essential beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the representation.</v>

249
00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.180
<v Speaker 1>So Mary represents the feminine domain </v>
<v Speaker 1>from which potential being emergence,</v>

250
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.583
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizing defendant in </v>

251
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:05.224
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what are the pictures I will </v>

252
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.314
<v Speaker 1>show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I just love is married to another </v>

253
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:10.864
<v Speaker 1>representation of Mary and she's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ in her hands and she's holding </v>

254
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Speaker 1>them up to the left and her foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your foot is gone.</v>

255
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.143
<v Speaker 1>A snake's head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is so cool because if you </v>

256
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:19.924
<v Speaker 1>look at that picture and you strip away </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Judeo Christian presuppositions and </v>

257
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you just look at it like a damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist,</v>

258
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:26.981
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

259
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>of course that's what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

260
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.303
<v Speaker 1>It's like Mama chimp keeps the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant away from the snakes and that's </v>

261
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 1>the archetype and of course it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype because that is what you do.</v>

262
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.063
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you're a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have nice edible </v>

263
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.043
<v Speaker 1>babies that snakes like to eat and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is certainly something that </v>

264
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>characterizes us in our evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

265
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's no wonder it's a divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype,</v>

266
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>

267
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>How could it not be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

268
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in that.</v>

269
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.583
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you don't believe in </v>

270
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

271
00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.463
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even understand what that means </v>

272
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think about such things,</v>

273
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.694
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have an option about bleeding </v>

274
00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 1>and that it's just the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality,</v>

275
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.013
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the mother of God and it's what </v>

276
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.354
<v Speaker 1>you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on how much divinity is </v>

277
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.400
<v Speaker 1>embodied in your child and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have that child,</v>

278
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.051
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

279
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty big chunk of divinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and did that child.</v>

280
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:24.540
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes to get that.</v>

281
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep it away from predators</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

282
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>evil doers and try to raise it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best possible things.</v>

283
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you may say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe that.</v>

284
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.853
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know in so far as </v>

285
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:36.364
<v Speaker 1>you're a good mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be acting that I was going mad </v>

286
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to say that's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I actually think it's right.</v>

287
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.993
<v Speaker 1>I think the child is a container of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine and that your job as a mother is </v>

288
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.943
<v Speaker 1>to allow that child can facilitate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of that child into the </v>

289
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.124
<v Speaker 1>mythological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're up to and that's a </v>

290
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:54.674
<v Speaker 1>holy mission in so far as you could use </v>
<v Speaker 1>that word to describe anything and I </v>

291
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>failed to see how that is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most real thing.</v>

292
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.003
<v Speaker 1>So when I also think the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to do that as a </v>

293
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>monitoring will be the most rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you'll ever do in your life.</v>

294
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.323
<v Speaker 1>And you'll figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a powerful thing and your whole </v>

295
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>life can change this completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have your own child,</v>

296
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're not like other </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

297
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.253
<v Speaker 1>They're your old shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're the most important </v>

298
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world right then and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>then on,</v>

299
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>if you're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your priorities shift.</v>

300
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not about you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a sacrifice,</v>

301
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real sacrifice.</v>

302
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifice that women are called on </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and itself,</v>

303
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>two major sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

304
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:42.441
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.160
<v Speaker 1>the mother gives birth to the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

306
00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:44.994
<v Speaker 1>That's Hercules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not priced as Hercules and this </v>

307
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>particular representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's,</v>

308
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I love this representation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

309
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.273
<v Speaker 1>So Hercules',</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there in the darkness on the </v>

310
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the water retail,</v>

311
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.330
<v Speaker 1>so that's where he's situated themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and he's,</v>

312
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.213
<v Speaker 1>is he in this container now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing you can take about </v>

313
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.973
<v Speaker 1>that as a maternal container or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as cultural protection </v>

314
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.143
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's got this clock and if you </v>

315
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 1>look on the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got these weird bumps on it.</v>

316
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you understand this?</v>

317
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are our eyes.</v>

318
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marta,</v>

319
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>he's got this club and what's the club?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like attention.</v>

320
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.793
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

321
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.873
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to clump something you </v>

322
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>had to us to pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like a rampaging light.</v>

323
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And then if you turn away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's gonna eat you.</v>

324
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So the clubs useless without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

325
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know the picture says club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weapon.</v>

326
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.670
<v Speaker 1>A weapon is A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metta is a form of mental attention,</v>

327
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've bought my reverse.</v>

328
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.943
<v Speaker 1>Attention is a better weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate weapon against the </v>

329
00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:51.280
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

330
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.123
<v Speaker 1>her has got his eyes wide open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's peering out into the darkness he's </v>

331
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:58.890
<v Speaker 1>got this lion had because he killed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion and you know,</v>

332
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 1>men used to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and they were shepherds out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert in the Middle East.</v>

334
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they had to do was </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a lion with a spear.</v>

335
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.443
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

336
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that's really worth thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

337
00:17:12.571 --> 00:17:13.404
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be very hard to be very </v>

338
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:17.370
<v Speaker 1>friendly to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

339
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:18.204
<v Speaker 1>but men used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really something to think </v>

340
00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

341
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 1>so he's got this light into going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's King of the beasts,</v>

342
00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:27.360
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it represents the thing that's at the</v>

343
00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:28.194
<v Speaker 1>top of the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know that because otherwise </v>

344
00:17:30.211 --> 00:17:31.044
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't have understood the lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>king and the lion is a solar beast </v>

345
00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's yellow golden word sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

346
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.663
<v Speaker 1>what's a daylight creature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out there on the belt where </v>

347
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.813
<v Speaker 1>everything's son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's associated with the Sonnet </v>

348
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 1>illumination and enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like lions,</v>

349
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.710
<v Speaker 1>son Sutton with ice goes to conquer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

350
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what the mother does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she raises the proper son,</v>

351
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 1>so I know she's also doing that for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>

352
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.603
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's complicated because women are </v>

353
00:17:57.931 --> 00:17:58.764
<v Speaker 1>complicated and their role is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex and so to some degree </v>

354
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>they're the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to some degree they're the mother of</v>

355
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 1>the hero and those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

356
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to,</v>

357
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.120
<v Speaker 1>how to configure that.</v>

358
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 1>It's you could say,</v>

359
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

360
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.183
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that in some sense of a </v>

361
00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:33.871
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind or gives up her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual heroism as a sacrifice to the</v>

362
00:18:35.171 --> 00:18:36.004
<v Speaker 1>potential hero is a Mumford children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's worth thinking about because </v>

363
00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>my guess is that for most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother did that,</v>

364
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you want to,</v>

365
00:18:44.871 --> 00:18:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had a three months about what do</v>

366
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:50.050
<v Speaker 1>you want her great grandmother's shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her grandmother shoots.</v>

367
00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 1>She really liked her grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very feminine person,</v>

368
00:18:52.121 --> 00:18:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cookie making,</v>

369
00:18:54.131 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Apple Pie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shadow play grandmother,</v>

370
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:57.894
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had people in the old folks home </v>

371
00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:04.060
<v Speaker 1>even when she was 80 and she was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheerful and tough,</v>

372
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.220
<v Speaker 1>but she's a great person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked her,</v>

373
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.623
<v Speaker 1>but when my wife dream diversity driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was trying on her shoes and the </v>

374
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.550
<v Speaker 1>shoes were too small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and that was very interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to indicate to me,</v>

376
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.220
<v Speaker 1>and she loved your grandmother now </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about that,</v>

377
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.780
<v Speaker 1>that role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite her grandmother having fulfilled</v>

378
00:19:22.781 --> 00:19:25.930
<v Speaker 1>us so well it wasn't announced and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

379
00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:26.764
<v Speaker 1>women have kind of decided that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's for the best because now </v>

380
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.950
<v Speaker 1>there's all these smart women's running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around doing useful things and you know,</v>

381
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.060
<v Speaker 1>that's probably good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly how to sort that out.</v>

382
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You figure it out.</v>

383
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.580
<v Speaker 2>So what time is it.</v>
