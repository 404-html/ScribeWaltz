1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.733
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably come across this little </v>

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>diagram in the book and it's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated diagram,</v>

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.264
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to just walk you through it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit and then he'll tell you the </v>

4
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a sequence of interconnected </v>
<v Speaker 1>causal loop.</v>

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>So the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>how does morality emerged from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom?</v>

8
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.493
<v Speaker 1>especially the morality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with assuming that attention </v>

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>is something that's sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so managing,</v>

12
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you'll see someone reading engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

13
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.911
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I'd really like to be engaged like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you would think,</v>

15
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everyone wants that.</v>

16
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be engaged.</v>

17
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might think,</v>

18
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person looks like they're fully </v>

19
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

20
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>They're not being obsessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and all that.</v>

21
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>They're into what they're doing.</v>

22
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>What's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.051
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

25
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.293
<v Speaker 1>why is creative exploration useful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is because it can </v>

27
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>generate adaptive behavior of all sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

28
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.434
<v Speaker 1>so then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can imitate the adaptive </v>

29
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>behavior because we can use our bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>as representational devices.</v>

30
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So we act out the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in something.</v>

31
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually in large part why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to buy art,</v>

32
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lots of people I've seen by arc,</v>

33
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.573
<v Speaker 1>they liked to buy art because they also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some contact with the artists and </v>

34
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.024
<v Speaker 1>they want to have some contact methey </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists because it's kind of cool to </v>

35
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>have contact with an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings something into their life.</v>

36
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And the artist is definitely someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's outside standard hierarchies.</v>

37
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what defines an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then once you imitate the adaptive </v>

38
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.634
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can play around with the </v>

39
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:44.271
<v Speaker 1>invitations a bit and you can ritualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then you can dramatize them and</v>

40
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>dramas and interesting thing.</v>

41
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Once it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it gets formalized,</v>

42
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically what you're doing,</v>

43
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>imagine little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get together,</v>

44
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>they lay out some rules for pretend </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

45
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Then they run us pretend play </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>

46
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Then imagine like little shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior is off to the side and he's taken</v>

47
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:04.814
<v Speaker 1>some notes and maybe he watches six or </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven different pretend play episodes </v>

48
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.624
<v Speaker 1>this was the most interesting part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and this was the most interesting </v>

50
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:12.534
<v Speaker 1>part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the most interesting part of </v>

51
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll put those all together,</v>

52
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>make them coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a really good story.</v>

53
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.793
<v Speaker 1>And what the story is is an articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of a dramatic </v>

54
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>representation of a set of procedures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two orders of abstraction,</v>

55
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know this because when you read </v>

56
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this doesn't happen to me anymore</v>

57
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>because I think I've read too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

58
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but I can remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was reading a book of fiction,</v>

59
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>it was as if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was being described was playing out</v>

60
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>in my imagination as embodied fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

61
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you go to a movie of a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've read and you think,</v>

62
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:51.174
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person doesn't look anything like </v>

63
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>the person in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>because you have a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the person is like.</v>

65
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.383
<v Speaker 1>I found as I've gotten older that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't understand this is I don't </v>

66
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.294
<v Speaker 1>have that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still understand the books so I </v>

67
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>must've become so automatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's all gone.</v>

68
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.593
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a loss I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

70
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

71
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.913
<v Speaker 1>You see that once you get the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>dram or written down or even when you </v>

72
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:19.050
<v Speaker 1>can say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can tell a story,</v>

73
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:19.884
<v Speaker 1>you're so close to having the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern revealed in an articulated </v>

74
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say what the pattern is,</v>

75
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>but you can describe it well once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can describe it,</v>

76
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right next to philosophy,</v>

77
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we have a set of dramas that </v>

78
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:37.050
<v Speaker 1>we can all agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially once they get written down,</v>

79
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>then we can start thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramas.</v>

80
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's when philosophy enters the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

81
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:42.894
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the groundwork for look for </v>

82
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has already laid by centuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and centuries of human interaction.</v>

83
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.513
<v Speaker 1>And we keep out abstracting that up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where we can represent it and </v>

84
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:54.324
<v Speaker 1>then we can pull out general principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we discussed them and debate about </v>

85
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

86
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>But that's the birth of philosophy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those levels interplay.</v>

87
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.033
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not just the causal direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just from creative exploration </v>

88
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:06.564
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's each time you add a new level that </v>

89
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.010
<v Speaker 1>interacts with the previous level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:15.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can talk about how you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play or you can analyze literature,</v>

91
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can think about what you're going</v>

92
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>to write about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>so each time you add another level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the capacity for abstraction,</v>

94
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you make the whole system much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic and complex.</v>

95
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.673
<v Speaker 1>So the causal links,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's all those little </v>

96
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.344
<v Speaker 1>arrows on outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those areas are interacting with </v>

97
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

98
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Rama.</v>

99
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many arrows.</v>

100
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you something here.</v>

101
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>This is quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that?</v>

102
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Did I show you that before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

103
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:51.560
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mind boggling,</v>

104
00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.534
<v Speaker 1>So the horizontal line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all the little squiggles that </v>

106
00:04:57.111 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>are underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those lines is a biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>verse.</v>

108
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.593
<v Speaker 1>And the length of the line corresponds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to how many references there is to that </v>

109
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>verse in other places in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at the bloody thing,</v>

110
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing's hyperlinked,</v>

111
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:14.420
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why the book,</v>

112
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about this book like a normal </v>

113
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really what you do.</v>

114
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.723
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go see a movie and there's a </v>

115
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:21.794
<v Speaker 1>timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a beginning and a middle and an </v>

116
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a losery,</v>

117
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the person who was writing the </v>

118
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 1>movie saw the whole thing at once.</v>

119
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.163
<v Speaker 1>And so they could use their knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ending to fiddle around with the </v>

120
00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>beginning and they could use their </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the middle to fiddle around</v>

121
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 1>with the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen in real life.</v>

122
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.073
<v Speaker 1>So you can lay this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine you've got a story and it's </v>

123
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>like 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and a 150,000</v>

124
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:48.650
<v Speaker 1>people have edited it and they all knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end and the middle and the beginning</v>

125
00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>and they just go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:50.774
<v Speaker 1>this means this and that refers to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that refers to this and that refers </v>

127
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:56.330
<v Speaker 1>to this and this means that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well you end up with that.</v>

128
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's infinitely dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to the bottom of it.</v>

129
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really it's hyperlinked.</v>

130
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

131
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.363
<v Speaker 1>you could say that in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bible is the world's first fully </v>

132
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:14.230
<v Speaker 1>hyperlink document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

133
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

134
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.883
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

135
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.931
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

136
00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and part of that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually conscious.</v>

137
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're criticizing Christianity is</v>

138
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:30.364
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you look at the gospel stories </v>

139
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:32.434
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a little story about Christ </v>

140
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:35.044
<v Speaker 1>and then there'll be this line that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy and </v>

141
00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 1>the biblical scholars say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

142
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:41.494
<v Speaker 1>that was put in later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it was put in later was </v>

143
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

144
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.693
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis of the savior is nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament and it keeps </v>

145
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.540
<v Speaker 1>partially coming true with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>

146
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.823
<v Speaker 1>So a profit is like a partial savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the Old Testament prophets are </v>

147
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.294
<v Speaker 1>just popping up like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually what happens is Israel gets </v>

148
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>degenerate for one reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the king isn't being a good</v>

149
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:07.314
<v Speaker 1>martech basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then a prophet who's very </v>

150
00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>insightful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Nietzsche or Dostoevsky pops up and</v>

151
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:13.681
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

152
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:14.514
<v Speaker 1>you're not paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orphans and widows and you better get </v>

153
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:17.934
<v Speaker 1>your act together because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's going to come along and like </v>

154
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:20.321
<v Speaker 1>flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:22.890
<v Speaker 1>out or your enemies are going to stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

156
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often weirdly enough,</v>

157
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the king's listen because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

158
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:28.344
<v Speaker 1>this person is either completely insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>or God's talking to him because </v>

159
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:34.260
<v Speaker 1>otherwise he wouldn't be marching into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the court when I could have his head cut</v>

160
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:35.094
<v Speaker 1>off with one 10th of a second orders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So often they kind of half pay </v>

161
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:40.530
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens,</v>

162
00:07:40.531 --> 00:07:43.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is northrop fries </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation fundamentally,</v>

163
00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:46.740
<v Speaker 1>is that the whole testament is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of an empire.</v>

164
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's collapsed because of its failure to</v>

165
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:53.730
<v Speaker 1>follow the fundamental moral order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it rises again,</v>

166
00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:55.230
<v Speaker 1>collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rises again,</v>

167
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.200
<v Speaker 1>collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first story like that is the flood,</v>

168
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really,</v>

169
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.430
<v Speaker 1>really old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the Bible doesn't get quasi historic </v>
<v Speaker 1>until Abraham,</v>

171
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.613
<v Speaker 1>the stories before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be like the creation of </v>

172
00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:12.540
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve.</v>

173
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tower of Babel,</v>

174
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel.</v>

175
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

176
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.760
<v Speaker 1>That's later Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

177
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.633
<v Speaker 1>then the Abrahamic story start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's more like the history of </v>

178
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:24.484
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's also mythologized the </v>

179
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:27.220
<v Speaker 1>first set of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

180
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 1>those things are old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how old,</v>

181
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.750
<v Speaker 1>really old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

182
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.670
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're old.</v>

183
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.103
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens across time is that people </v>

184
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 1>have all these biblical books and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the Mesopotamians had to do in</v>

185
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 1>order to organize their society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

186
00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got all these writings,</v>

187
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 1>they're all sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically,</v>

188
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they contradict each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to be in any order.</v>

189
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.003
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then there's this collaboration </v>

190
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:57.590
<v Speaker 1>of minds across to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh hell,</v>

191
00:08:57.591 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>he kind of looks like this might go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then this might go there.</v>

192
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And this refers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this refers to that.</v>

193
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And so it is that it's tar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to,</v>

194
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>it's the collective imagination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity trying to make a coherent story</v>

195
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>out of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

196
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

197
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's our best guess.</v>

198
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by true,</v>

199
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>

200
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>very tricky question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly this,</v>

201
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the question it's trying to answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how should you act?</v>

202
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's not the story that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific story,</v>

203
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's a bloody important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

204
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Egypt,</v>

205
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I felt like you didn't know the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

206
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.763
<v Speaker 1>what was his name?</v>

207
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

208
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>who discovered buoyancy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran through the streets.</v>

209
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Eureka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was that?</v>

210
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Archimedes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So archimedes was trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to measure the volume of something.</v>

212
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.093
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wanted to figure out how you </v>

213
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>determined whether an alloy was pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold or not.</v>

214
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd have to get the volume of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn thing and then maybe at a clump</v>

215
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.730
<v Speaker 1>of metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you could measure.</v>

216
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.023
<v Speaker 1>And then he figured out that if you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tub full of water and you drop the </v>

217
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.883
<v Speaker 1>thing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of water that spilled over </v>

218
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>the edges would tell you exactly how big</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing was.</v>

219
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you could weigh your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your metal,</v>

220
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and you could tell what proportion of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was gold.</v>

221
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And so he was so thrilled about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He theoretically,</v>

222
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>he discovered that when he was in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathtub,</v>

223
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.920
<v Speaker 1>he got it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water spilled over.</v>

224
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 1>He ran naked through the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever townie was in yelling.</v>

225
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Eureka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eureka.</v>

226
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

227
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's an insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.034
<v Speaker 1>So I felt like that when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read this Egyptian story and I </v>

229
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>thought I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because I thought,</v>

230
00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's mind boggling.</v>

231
00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:42.874
<v Speaker 1>So here's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to show you some of these </v>

232
00:10:45.341 --> 00:10:46.174
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

233
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.463
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

234
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>So the guy in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

235
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:00.160
<v Speaker 1>so cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on this pillar.</v>

236
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So he started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents what pillars represent,</v>

237
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.050
<v Speaker 1>which is what whole things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

238
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horace and horace is,</v>

239
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got the head of a forking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:13.204
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that falcons </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly around so they're not attached to </v>

241
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:17.410
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can really,</v>

242
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:18.071
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

243
00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:20.320
<v Speaker 1>really see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're birds of prey in there,</v>

244
00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:22.390
<v Speaker 1>about the only animal who can see better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than us.</v>

245
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.060
<v Speaker 1>So like rap doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds of prey,</v>

246
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.340
<v Speaker 1>they can see like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think an eagle.</v>

247
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.340
<v Speaker 1>If an eagle was standing on the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the empire state building,</v>

248
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it could see a dime on the sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Gold Eagle.</v>

249
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And then the one on the right is isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Isis is queen of the underworld.</v>

250
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one other character </v>

251
00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:42.124
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

252
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.410
<v Speaker 1>You see that's a Madonna and child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

253
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.760
<v Speaker 1>There are that character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's seth and seth is,</v>

254
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.090
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what the hell seth is.</v>

255
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.013
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's been able figure out what kind </v>

256
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>of weird animal that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows?</v>

257
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>But those are the four main characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

258
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So now you got to know how they interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

259
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.090
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go to Cyrus and the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's variants of this story,</v>

260
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.103
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you like one sort of </v>

261
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.960
<v Speaker 1>canonical variant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So story of Osiris and Isis and horace.</v>

262
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

264
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and this is the story upon which </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian civilization was based,</v>

265
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>although it was a very old civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

266
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:30.244
<v Speaker 1>Lasted for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Cleopatra was last time from </v>

267
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra to now than there is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra and the Pyramids.</v>

268
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of tells you how old Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

269
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like old major civilization lasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>

270
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>had a powerful story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerfully organizing story,</v>

271
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

272
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.963
<v Speaker 1>Way older than like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the history of Judeo Christian </v>

273
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 2000 years old,</v>

274
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>older than Chinese history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's old.</v>

275
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 1>China goes back a long ways though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

276
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not older than China,</v>

277
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

278
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>well cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

279
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus was that God who established </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt?</v>

280
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's like George Washington.</v>

281
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>If you had George Washington 2000 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>

282
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>then George Washington would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus because he'd be mythologized,</v>

283
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically,</v>

284
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:26.344
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus represents all the good things </v>

285
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that the Egyptians did to establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>order from chaos and set up the society.</v>

286
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great,</v>

287
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 1>he was a great hero when he was young </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did all sorts of heroic things.</v>

288
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And he established the state of Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he rules over it,</v>

289
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but he's kind of old and he can't see as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as he used to.</v>

290
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And he's little on the muddle headed </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

291
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>but worse than that.</v>

292
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 1>So He's archaic and anachronistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that indicates is that,</v>

293
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the Americans are experiencing</v>

294
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:58.210
<v Speaker 1>with their constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

295
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things a little on the old side.</v>

296
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>What should we do with it while we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should update?</v>

297
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we don't want to update it in a way</v>

298
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that makes all chaos break forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

299
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.623
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get our cat just because they </v>

300
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:14.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you set up a system of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tea,</v>

302
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to adapt to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

303
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but the environment keeps wiggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

304
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to chase it with the rules </v>

305
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and you have to update the rules as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape changes.</v>

306
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's the biologists call that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>red queen problem,</v>

307
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:27.244
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a reference to Alice in </v>

308
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:30.004
<v Speaker 1>wonderland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Alice goes down the rabbit hole and </v>

309
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>she finds the Red Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the queen of chaos,</v>

310
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:35.134
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature.</v>

311
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's always chopping people's heads</v>

312
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 1>off for arbitrary reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

313
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

314
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things she tells Ellis' </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in my kingdom,</v>

315
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to run as fast as you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay in the same place.</v>

316
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the chronic human problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the problem of entropy,</v>

317
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.243
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that you build something static but </v>

318
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:54.254
<v Speaker 1>things aren't static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if it's a useful thing you've </v>

319
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:57.680
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

320
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you got to maintain the hell out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's just going to fall apart.</v>

321
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>But worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environments running away from it.</v>

322
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>And so your computers have oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus problems all the time.</v>

323
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.483
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're just lovely for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first three years that you own them and </v>

324
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:10.454
<v Speaker 1>then their bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because the underlying </v>

325
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>landscape is so dynamic that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure you loses its validity.</v>

326
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You can almost watch it lose its </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity,</v>

327
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of the exponential </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase in computer intelligence.</v>

329
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was young,</v>

330
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>little old fashioned and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's willfully blind.</v>

331
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Now the Egyptians insisted on that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cool.</v>

332
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.053
<v Speaker 1>It's actually you can be held </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible in an English common law </v>

333
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>court for willful blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what willful blindness is.</v>

334
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 1>The failure is the failure to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you could have realized.</v>

335
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.483
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a CEO and you have a crooked </v>

336
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>chief financial officer and you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's crooked,</v>

337
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>but you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

338
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to look at the books </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then I know,</v>

339
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 1>and then his malfeasance is brought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and you say,</v>

340
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the prosecutor will say,</v>

341
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could have.</v>

342
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>And you knew you could have and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

343
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're culpable for your own ignorance.</v>

344
00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's such a brilliant idea.</v>

345
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians figured this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

346
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 1>cyrus is not only old and decrepit and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little on the Alzheimer he side,</v>

347
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but he won't pay attention to things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had it with that.</v>

348
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.104
<v Speaker 1>He's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem because he has a </v>

349
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>brother who's the evil brother of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightful king,</v>

350
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>which is a theme that you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with.</v>

351
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 1>If you watched your Disney movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like scar in the lion king,</v>

352
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Guy.</v>

353
00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Or in a Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

354
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bad character.</v>

355
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alert.</v>

356
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

358
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

359
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 1>he's the evil or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Darth vader in star wars.</v>

360
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:53.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

361
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.823
<v Speaker 1>he's an archetypal figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the evil brother of the rightful </v>

362
00:16:57.981 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

363
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.250
<v Speaker 1>why does the rightful king has an evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother?</v>

364
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.533
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because organizations tend towards </v>

365
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 1>decay and corruption across time.</v>

366
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.253
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Socialists are really on this </v>

367
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>with regards to corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

368
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 1>The evil corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

369
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the right wingers,</v>

370
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.331
<v Speaker 1>thank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

371
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:20.810
<v Speaker 1>it's evil government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just projecting the archetype</v>

372
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>of the negative farther onto the respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of organizations,</v>

373
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:25.094
<v Speaker 1>when in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a characteristic of </v>

374
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:26.894
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't keep an eye on the damn </v>

375
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they degenerate and they become corrupt.</v>

376
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better stay awake to deal with that.</v>

377
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

378
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 1>cyrus has this evil brother named seth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and seth,</v>

379
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>the name Seth Becomes Satan through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coptic Christians much,</v>

380
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:44.601
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

381
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:47.000
<v Speaker 1>much later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like the precursor to the,</v>

382
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.190
<v Speaker 1>to the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

383
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Cyrus think staff is all right,</v>

384
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.933
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scar does or like move Fossa does </v>

385
00:17:55.741 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>with scarp underestimates his danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something you should never do.</v>

386
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And so one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus,</v>

387
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.904
<v Speaker 1>he's just not paying much attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seth gets a big symitar something like </v>

388
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chops them into pieces.</v>

389
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't really kill oh cyrus,</v>

390
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>because he's a god as well as being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>founder of the state and the ruler,</v>

391
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.403
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you can do is make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for him to get his act back </v>

392
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what seth does is he takes so Cyrus's</v>

393
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 1>pieces and he scatters them all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

394
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption overtakes and organization,</v>

395
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>then things fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the things aren't actually dead.</v>

396
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when a corporation falls </v>

397
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people in it don't die.</v>

398
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 1>They just fragment into maybe smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

399
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.113
<v Speaker 1>Some companies get spun off or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they fragment all the way down to the </v>

400
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still potency left in it.</v>

401
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.503
<v Speaker 1>And the structure is still there inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the individuals and the sub </v>

402
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

403
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you can get the damn thing to fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

404
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get rid of it so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he does that.</v>

405
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:01.104
<v Speaker 1>He scatters these pieces everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it hard for old cyrus to </v>

406
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>recollect himself or to get his act back</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

407
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So things fall apart and it's hard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to get your act back together.</v>

408
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

409
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>and then he rules the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't work out very well.</v>

410
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Just like scar in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

411
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Because he's an evil tyrant and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things considered evil.</v>

412
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Tyranny doesn't work that well even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil tyrant.</v>

413
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Well though you should never assume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an evil tyrant wants things to work out.</v>

414
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even for him.</v>

415
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

416
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus has a wife,</v>

417
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.973
<v Speaker 1>isis now isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a major league player in ancient </v>

418
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis as queen of the underworld.</v>

419
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's a real costs up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at archaic cultures,</v>

420
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 1>whether the top God is the guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order guy like,</v>

421
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus or the top God is Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's queen of the underworld.</v>

422
00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's 50 50 for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

423
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.804
<v Speaker 1>isis represents chaos and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus represents order and they should </v>

424
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 1>be in balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

425
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're in a harmonious balance like </v>

426
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:08.274
<v Speaker 1>Appsu and Tiamat and they produce all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of productive things and if one </v>

427
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:13.620
<v Speaker 1>overwhelms the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it's not so good.</v>

428
00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>So they should be a harmonious couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

429
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>But now I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus is dead whack.</v>

430
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:23.250
<v Speaker 1>He's chopped up and spread everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So op isis comes out of the underworld.</v>

431
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what happened when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans invaded Iraq.</v>

432
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

433
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>well cyrus has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

434
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but what about Isis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

435
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>we forgot about isis up she comes chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

436
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it better?</v>

437
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't obviously.</v>

438
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.460
<v Speaker 1>So you never want to forget about isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

439
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that happy that,</v>

440
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:49.084
<v Speaker 1>oh sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russ has gone because that's her </v>

441
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:50.381
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

442
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And she thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not so,</v>

443
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.943
<v Speaker 1>so helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she does is she runs around </v>

444
00:20:55.031 --> 00:21:00.031
<v Speaker 1>Egypt trying to find his fellas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it,</v>

445
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>it's the seminal apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

446
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:03.634
<v Speaker 1>It's the seed of the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she does is she finds his </v>

447
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Phallus and she makes herself pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

448
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And so bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes back down to the underworld.</v>

449
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.480
<v Speaker 1>But now she's impregnated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

450
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 1>It means when remarkable things fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart into chaos,</v>

451
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the seeds of something new or </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially planted.</v>

452
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

453
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 1>She gives birth to horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Arthur,</v>

454
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:31.110
<v Speaker 1>he's outside his rightful kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Simba standard routine,</v>

455
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 1>just like Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

456
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 1>He's outside his kingdom.</v>

457
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside your kingdom.</v>

458
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:37.534
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Kingdom is Sorta old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic and doesn't quite fit the </v>

459
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:41.164
<v Speaker 1>circumstances now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not all that fair to you and </v>

460
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:43.474
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you grow up to some degree and </v>

461
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] opposition to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just an archetypal story.</v>

462
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this character,</v>

463
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.950
<v Speaker 1>she finally gives birth to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and that.</v>

464
00:21:54.951 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus and no cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

465
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 1>he's quite the character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that.</v>

466
00:21:59.021 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 1>So sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

467
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:00.784
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is horace and that's horace </v>

468
00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:03.124
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's the benevolent goddess of all </v>

469
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 1>new things as well as being the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddess of the underworld.</v>

470
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And she knows she's bringing up horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace,</v>

471
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.963
<v Speaker 1>where is he here?</v>

472
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Horace is,</v>

473
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>this is fulcan cause he can fly around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see everything and he's also the eye</v>

474
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>of the Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>

475
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>he's like Marduk these eyes he can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

476
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 1>so then horace grows up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

477
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fond the world stuff.</v>

478
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have my kingdom back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my rightful kingdom.</v>

479
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.313
<v Speaker 1>And now he's different than oh cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason these different is </v>

480
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:45.070
<v Speaker 1>because he can see and normally can he </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

481
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 1>he will see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole different thing.</v>

482
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:48.844
<v Speaker 1>So Horace is not willfully blind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a drag because he can see what's </v>

483
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 1>happened to the kingdom and he can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>south and that's not so good.</v>

484
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're in in Romeo declares </v>
<v Speaker 1>position then aren't you?</v>

485
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to shake hands with the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what happened to Romeo,</v>

486
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>dell error when that happened.</v>

487
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like post term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a general right.</v>

488
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:06.964
<v Speaker 1>I hope you know all know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know he was there in Rwanda when </v>

489
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:12.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody got massacred in the u.</v>
<v Speaker 1>N didn't step in property.</v>

490
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.553
<v Speaker 1>Had to watch all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like post traumatic stress </v>

491
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:16.594
<v Speaker 1>disorder instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if your eyes open and you </v>

492
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 1>can see evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you better look out because if</v>

493
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:23.824
<v Speaker 1>you're face to face with real </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence the probability that that </v>

494
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 1>will damage your brain is very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

495
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:30.184
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting if you think about post </v>

496
00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder is that often </v>
<v Speaker 1>in soldiers it's,</v>

497
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.573
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of something they </v>

498
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:39.940
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not something they saw.</v>

499
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.740
<v Speaker 1>So they'll go out in the battlefield and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll find out there far more barbaras</v>

500
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 1>and cruel and destructive than they ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagined.</v>

501
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they going to fit that into like</v>

502
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 1>corn fed farm boy from Iowa skied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

503
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it.</v>

504
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole structure is gone.</v>

505
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It's very stressful to find that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing out.</v>

506
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>And the people I've had in my practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have had ptsd,</v>

507
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.763
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjected to some kind of malevolence </v>

508
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.713
<v Speaker 1>like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came face to face with something </v>

509
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in one case,</v>

510
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client whose boyfriend was going</v>

511
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:16.334
<v Speaker 1>to rape her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was naive beyond belief and what </v>

512
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.503
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] gave her a posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder wasn't what he did </v>

513
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>because she could fight him off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She happened to be bigger than he was.</v>

514
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It was the look of malevolence on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face when he attacked her.</v>

515
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>That was enough and it she had severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic syndrome symptoms for four</v>

516
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:36.650
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

517
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't even sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her whole body would vibrate and it took</v>

518
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>a lot of untangling before we figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that it was the look on his face and</v>

519
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.123
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other times it's like becoming face to </v>

520
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 1>face with this sort of thing is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So horace can see,</v>

521
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 1>but luckily he's a long ways from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

522
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>

523
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.930
<v Speaker 2>He ended up becoming making,</v>

524
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a nat tay.</v>

525
00:25:28.831 --> 00:25:29.664
<v Speaker 1>That's to put the chaos back in an Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing you might want to know about </v>

526
00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:32.964
<v Speaker 1>Hitler is that one day in World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got a medal for bravery in world war </v>

527
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:36.884
<v Speaker 1>one by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hitler was all sitting around with </v>

528
00:25:38.341 --> 00:25:40.950
<v Speaker 1>his buddies in a trench and he went off </v>
<v Speaker 1>to relieve himself.</v>

529
00:25:40.951 --> 00:25:41.784
<v Speaker 1>And when he came back they were all dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the shell had landed right in </v>

530
00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:44.994
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that gave him the idea that he </v>

531
00:25:46.651 --> 00:25:47.484
<v Speaker 1>was saved for something special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you if that happened to </v>

532
00:25:50.041 --> 00:25:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would feel,</v>

533
00:25:50.971 --> 00:25:53.070
<v Speaker 1>cause what are you using your options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible,</v>

534
00:25:53.071 --> 00:25:53.904
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty place where brutal things happen </v>

535
00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:57.330
<v Speaker 1>at random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one option.</v>

536
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Or You were saved because something </v>
<v Speaker 1>special is waiting for you.</v>

537
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.500
<v Speaker 1>So like it's toss up which of those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pick,</v>

538
00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:05.580
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to pick one of them.</v>

539
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

540
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.850
<v Speaker 1>so horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can see sec too bad for him.</v>

541
00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:12.684
<v Speaker 1>So he goes back to the kingdom and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has like vicious fight with scent and </v>

542
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:17.484
<v Speaker 1>sets like they're pretty evenly matched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea there is that even if </v>

543
00:26:20.671 --> 00:26:23.190
<v Speaker 1>your horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like son of the,</v>

544
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.940
<v Speaker 1>of order and son of chaos and your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are open,</v>

545
00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a pretty evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty even battle.</v>

546
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.983
<v Speaker 1>So they're fighting away and seth gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>to apprehend and he tears out one of </v>

547
00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:37.260
<v Speaker 1>horses eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then horace,</v>

548
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.760
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:39.594
<v Speaker 1>that's a drag to lose an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his vision is damaged by his with </v>

550
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Horace keeps fighting and eventually</v>

551
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.094
<v Speaker 1>he prevails and it gets the eye back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he banishes seth to the Nether regions </v>

552
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:51.684
<v Speaker 1>of the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in the lion king where you </v>

553
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.694
<v Speaker 1>know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light touches is the kingdom and </v>

554
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 1>then there's the nether regions is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where your sandal seth.</v>

555
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So you can't get rid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't kill him.</v>

556
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.410
<v Speaker 1>He's permanent because societies will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always tend towards corruption.</v>

557
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Best you can do is get the damn guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>under control for a while.</v>

558
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:10.584
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now horace has his eye and you think </v>

559
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 1>and of story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good story.</v>

560
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:15.474
<v Speaker 1>You could animate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just slapped the old I back in his </v>

561
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 1>pick up the sector and he'd rule happily</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever after.</v>

563
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Now it isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens instead is he take,</v>

564
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.443
<v Speaker 1>he keeps his eye and he goes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld and he finds those Cyrus's </v>

565
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 1>ghosts down there and it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there like this,</v>

566
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:34.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cause it's all chopped up and you </v>

567
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:36.474
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird combination because in one </v>

568
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.703
<v Speaker 1>plane it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chopped up body that's </v>

569
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>distributed everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But down in the underworld,</v>

570
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like a ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit,</v>

571
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very animated.</v>

572
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of in the land of the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Pinocchio's farther in the whale.</v>

573
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So what does this whole horse do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 1>he gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus his eye.</v>

575
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So now blind tradition can see and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes his father,</v>

576
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:08.630
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus backup to the surface sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're a unit arm in arm,</v>

577
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the,</v>

578
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it's the combination of horizontal Cyrus</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rule Egypt.</v>

579
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the Egyptians figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

580
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

581
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:19.350
<v Speaker 1>that's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

582
00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 1>well you need this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the traditions of the state,</v>

583
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need them.</v>

584
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.310
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're vital,</v>

585
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.233
<v Speaker 1>they hold back chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just let that go because then </v>

586
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 1>income seth and up comes the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not good.</v>

587
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:35.783
<v Speaker 1>You need that as a bulwark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it's old and kind of blind and </v>

588
00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's going to tend towards corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fall over of its own accord.</v>

589
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.043
<v Speaker 1>So how do you solve that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it pay attention and </v>

590
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you provide dead tradition with living </v>
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>

591
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.823
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get to be the ruler of the </v>

592
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:57.510
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rightful ruler of the state.</v>

593
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Now the Egyptians basically hypothesize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this took a long time,</v>

594
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that the Pharaoh also had an immortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

595
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.933
<v Speaker 1>He was the only person who did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the immortal soul was basically the </v>

596
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:09.714
<v Speaker 1>combination of Horace and oh Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Egyptians conceptualize that as </v>

597
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>something that was eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

598
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 1>and it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the eternal,</v>

599
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 1>it was the central eternal feature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

600
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as long as the Pharaoh was a good</v>

601
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:28.944
<v Speaker 1>horace Ando Cyrus at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he was the rightful sovereign and </v>

602
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 1>he was reflecting something of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utmost value.</v>

603
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And it was a mortal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart.</v>

604
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

605
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.520
<v Speaker 1>they call this the democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>old cyrus.</v>

606
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>So to begin with in the Egyptian state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could only use the horace.</v>

607
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:50.314
<v Speaker 1>Oh Cyrus symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were either of the Pharaoh to </v>

608
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least a high ranking aristocrat.</v>

609
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>But what happened as Egypt progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

610
00:29:58.991 --> 00:29:59.824
<v Speaker 1>as it developed across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the right to use the symbolism </v>

611
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:04.743
<v Speaker 1>that that was the horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus conjunction drifted down the </v>

612
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at some point all the aristocrats got</v>

613
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:13.414
<v Speaker 1>to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never drifted down to like women are </v>

614
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Carmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are slaves or anything like that.</v>

615
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:18.723
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically the Jews came out of </v>

616
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:22.684
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and one of the things the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that went beyond the Egyptians was </v>

617
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:31.891
<v Speaker 1>that each person was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was capable,</v>

618
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:33.963
<v Speaker 1>was ennobled in some sense by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential relationship with the highest </v>

619
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 1>value that was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the Christian showed up.</v>

620
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 1>But that was universalized everyone had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

621
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 1>even prostitutes and slaves.</v>

622
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's so cool because what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>these societies get the idea of,</v>

623
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.540
<v Speaker 1>of sovereignty laid out in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal heavenly drama.</v>

624
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And they identify that with the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at the top of the hierarchy,</v>

625
00:30:58.691 --> 00:30:59.524
<v Speaker 1>which is what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens across time is </v>

626
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody wakes up and thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

627
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:05.890
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's characteristic of the Pharaoh.</v>

628
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It's characteristic of what should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign.</v>

629
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's characteristic of what the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>value is,</v>

630
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody and it's,</v>

631
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:15.754
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to overstate how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important that is because our whole </v>

632
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:20.164
<v Speaker 1>conception of the idea of natural rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on the idea that there's </v>

633
00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:25.804
<v Speaker 1>something about you as an individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual whose value is inviolable so </v>

634
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:34.920
<v Speaker 1>much that it doesn't even matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

635
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.963
<v Speaker 1>So if I see you brutally murdered 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and there's 50 eye witnesses and </v>

636
00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:41.154
<v Speaker 1>we know for sure you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to be treated as if your </v>

637
00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:50.301
<v Speaker 1>central essence is of tremendous value </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be given due process.</v>

638
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.750
<v Speaker 1>The whole law bows down before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

639
00:31:54.751 --> 00:31:56.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do people believe this?</v>

640
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.413
<v Speaker 1>This sort of horace oh cyrus combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its relationship to what's </v>

641
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>ultimately valuable and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's embodied in every person.</v>

642
00:32:05.161 --> 00:32:07.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like they certainly act like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>

643
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.513
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they ever encounter a violation of </v>

644
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:13.260
<v Speaker 1>that in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially social practice,</v>

645
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody's jumping up and down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining.</v>

646
00:32:15.541 --> 00:32:18.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trampling on my rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

647
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Where'd those come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly?</v>

648
00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:25.941
<v Speaker 1>What are they and are they real or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're not real well,</v>

649
00:32:27.661 --> 00:32:31.140
<v Speaker 1>then I can trample over them all I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not real.</v>

650
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:32.863
<v Speaker 1>But if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we can just have an argument </v>

651
00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:35.174
<v Speaker 1>about what human beings are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they are real and they're </v>

652
00:32:38.421 --> 00:32:39.254
<v Speaker 1>reflective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an underlying principle that's </v>

653
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>continually attempting to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a sense from the bottom up,</v>

654
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.883
<v Speaker 1>you better not break the rules because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really going against the cosmic </v>

655
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Egyptian story.</v>

656
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

657
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.003
<v Speaker 1>it's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder that story had enough </v>

658
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 1>dynamism to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to propel a whole culture across several</v>

659
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.330
<v Speaker 1>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a staggering achievement.</v>

660
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Ready today is sort of a primary,</v>

661
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

662
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good observation.</v>

663
00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:25.860
<v Speaker 1>That's just one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

664
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.853
<v Speaker 1>it's something new that I've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all of this in the last five </v>

665
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:32.070
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a long time,</v>

666
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

667
00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:35.454
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your reaction when one of those </v>

668
00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:38.784
<v Speaker 1>principles is violated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like the terror management </v>

669
00:33:40.921 --> 00:33:41.754
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

670
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the terror management people,</v>

671
00:33:43.441 --> 00:33:44.274
<v Speaker 1>it's fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real problem with that </v>

672
00:33:46.621 --> 00:33:51.210
<v Speaker 1>because conservatives tend to be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic than liberals and conservatives</v>

673
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:56.260
<v Speaker 1>who have more of a propensity for right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing authoritarianism are more likely to</v>

674
00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:59.700
<v Speaker 1>get upset when rules are violated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the rules seem to be,</v>

675
00:33:59.701 --> 00:34:00.930
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more,</v>

676
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.370
<v Speaker 1>or I thought that it was more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

677
00:34:02.371 --> 00:34:03.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly.</v>

678
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.480
<v Speaker 1>If your rules get violated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly fear,</v>

679
00:34:06.481 --> 00:34:07.314
<v Speaker 1>although fears part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the disintegration of your </v>

680
00:34:10.261 --> 00:34:13.500
<v Speaker 1>motivational states into general </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation for,</v>

681
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.573
<v Speaker 1>for readiness.</v>

682
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.503
<v Speaker 1>So that's more like a generalized stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>response and so everything goes on so </v>

683
00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:21.120
<v Speaker 1>that you're able to deal with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens next.</v>

684
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.523
<v Speaker 1>It's like Gottman's married couples when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that are going to get </v>

685
00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:26.491
<v Speaker 1>divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

686
00:34:26.491 --> 00:34:30.150
<v Speaker 1>They're very calm on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But underneath it's like the underworld,</v>

687
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.013
<v Speaker 1>all hell is broke loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's been a twist in that </v>

688
00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:34.254
<v Speaker 1>because there's a bunch of data coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>together from all over the world that </v>

689
00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:37.974
<v Speaker 1>basically goes like this is that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing authoritarianism seems to be based </v>

690
00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:43.674
<v Speaker 1>on purity and purity is discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and there's a deep biological </v>

691
00:34:48.931 --> 00:34:49.764
<v Speaker 1>route route for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people who are disgust sensitive </v>

692
00:34:52.831 --> 00:34:57.390
<v Speaker 1>and concerned with purity have better </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards of hygiene and they do tend to</v>

693
00:34:57.391 --> 00:34:58.224
<v Speaker 1>live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very much against </v>

694
00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally against any form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual contact.</v>

695
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It isn't bounded by the social contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't like foreigners,</v>

696
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's all a clump.</v>

697
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.200
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we've found recently,</v>

698
00:35:13.201 --> 00:35:14.034
<v Speaker 1>we haven't published this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've found recently that we know </v>

699
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.980
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>than liberals.</v>

700
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.203
<v Speaker 1>And then we found that conscientiousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragments into industriousness and </v>

701
00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:26.820
<v Speaker 1>orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was great because people have been</v>

702
00:35:26.821 --> 00:35:27.654
<v Speaker 1>wondering for five decades how you plug </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity for right wing </v>

703
00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:33.480
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism into the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality structure.</v>

704
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's complicated because if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical liberal like a lefty,</v>

705
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 1>those aren't liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

706
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 1>radical lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a communist.</v>

707
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:42.804
<v Speaker 1>You can be just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you can be just as </v>

708
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian as you would be if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a fascist.</v>

709
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't been quite sorted out yet,</v>

710
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's the orderliness that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make people have this right wing </v>

711
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:55.794
<v Speaker 1>proclivity and it does look like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do is control </v>

712
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

713
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the violation of that order,</v>

714
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.433
<v Speaker 1>a huge chunk of it seems to be in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely new negative emotion system </v>

715
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.103
<v Speaker 1>that we've only been untangling for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and it's not associated with </v>

716
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:14.574
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

717
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Liberals are actually more neurotic than</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

718
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you could say,</v>

719
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:21.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's because the conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so well protected.</v>

720
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:22.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

721
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:22.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

722
00:36:22.921 --> 00:36:23.754
<v Speaker 1>you can't post hoc use your theory to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict the opposite of what you would </v>

723
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 1>have predicted before the data comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

724
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:30.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are,</v>

725
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.283
<v Speaker 1>they should be more physiologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive and there's some evidence that </v>

726
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does really seem to be discussed.</v>

727
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And so to jump ahead a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when and after we'd sorted this out,</v>

728
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.820
<v Speaker 1>now a lot of the work that was done on </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust was done by Jonathan Haidt.</v>

729
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that deserves the credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the discussed purity linkage.</v>

730
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:51.144
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was pushing a study of discussed </v>

731
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>long before people were paying any </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it.</v>

732
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:56.244
<v Speaker 1>So good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was working on the orderliness </v>

733
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:00.684
<v Speaker 1>discussed relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also reading this book by Hitler </v>

734
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>called Hitler's table talk.</v>

735
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And what it was was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

736
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.763
<v Speaker 1>he would talk at his dinners and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected it from 1939 to 1942 and he </v>

737
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:15.270
<v Speaker 1>would like just spout off on whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that was on his mind.</v>

738
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And he was a very open person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very lateral discussion.</v>

739
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:20.040
<v Speaker 1>He was very interested in art and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

740
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.203
<v Speaker 1>but he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very orderly and he was a worshiper of </v>

741
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:26.730
<v Speaker 1>willpower and orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are like that like,</v>

742
00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anorexics are orderly to orderly.</v>

743
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.713
<v Speaker 1>They can't even stand their own bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's discussed that their bodies elicit </v>

744
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 1>and they prize the ability to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies.</v>

745
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's hyper orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I think why it's associated.</v>

746
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's generally considered an upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class disease.</v>

747
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.623
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are at that strata are hyper </v>

748
00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and that gets passed onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids and sometimes that's just too</v>

749
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

750
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.183
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really struck me </v>

751
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:58.650
<v Speaker 1>about Hitler's writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really,</v>

752
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it really blew me away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

753
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.650
<v Speaker 1>was that he has a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this thinking's metaphorical,</v>

754
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and the metaphor is the area in race is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pure body,</v>

755
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.140
<v Speaker 1>pure blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure uncontaminated,</v>

756
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's under assault by pathogens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites.</v>

757
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.313
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you know that bang he's got </v>

758
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:25.731
<v Speaker 1>is you've got the underlying dynamic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his appeal to the masses and Germans,</v>

759
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.490
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're orderly.</v>

760
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.673
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things people say is that </v>

761
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Germany constituted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that decline of civilization,</v>

762
00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 1>right back to barbarism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

763
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

764
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>

765
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 1>quite highly correlations about 0.4,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly the same as the correlation with</v>

766
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:50.104
<v Speaker 1>Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So conscientiousness is a prerequisite </v>

767
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 1>for civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think,</v>

768
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:55.144
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be disgust sensitive and </v>

769
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 1>an orderly?</v>

770
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And the answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

771
00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 1>how much of your grain do you want rats </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mice to eat because they eat lots of</v>

772
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:03.341
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

773
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And keeping the insects out of food </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

774
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

775
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to store things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're going to do,</v>

776
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.084
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better start to be concerned with </v>

777
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 1>hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

778
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So those things are gonna go together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

779
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was hyper orderly and hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust sensitive.</v>

780
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.323
<v Speaker 1>He'd washes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bathed four times a day and he was </v>

781
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about the ability to stand in</v>

782
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 1>the back of his car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has prayed car and keep his arm out like</v>

783
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 1>this for eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought of that is the triumph of the</v>

784
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.594
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when the will seem to be </v>

785
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 1>associated with this pro propensity </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards orderliness.</v>

786
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.660
<v Speaker 1>So another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and,</v>

787
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.633
<v Speaker 1>and I still don't exactly know what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make of this because it has complicated </v>

788
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.204
<v Speaker 1>my conceptualization because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to show you is based on </v>

789
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 1>fear and horror and horror is more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear plus discussed.</v>

790
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.713
<v Speaker 1>It's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the difference between the </v>

791
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Blair witch project and the Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>chainsaw massacre.</v>

792
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.813
<v Speaker 1>They're both horror movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one is pure fear and the other is </v>

793
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:08.131
<v Speaker 1>almost pure discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So disgust seems to be a huge element of</v>

794
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 1>this and it is a primary response by </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly people to the violation of moral</v>

795
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 1>norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's something weird.</v>

796
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.023
<v Speaker 1>There was a paper published in Plos one </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a year ago and what these people </v>

797
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.544
<v Speaker 1>did was they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did I think I within and across </v>

798
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 1>country survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this wasn't in developed countries.</v>

799
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.003
<v Speaker 1>So the question was how much infectious </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease was there in each of these </v>

800
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:42.841
<v Speaker 1>geographical locales?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next question was how right wing</v>

801
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 1>were the people who occupied those areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the individual level?</v>

802
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't interested in what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government was like.</v>

803
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.693
<v Speaker 1>And what they found was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between the prevalence of </v>

804
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:58.891
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases and right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism at the individual level</v>

805
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.980
<v Speaker 1>was 0.6</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

806
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and if you know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics,</v>

807
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:04.234
<v Speaker 1>when you see 0.6</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just fall over at hyperventilate </v>

808
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 1>because that never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an effect size that's,</v>

809
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.803
<v Speaker 1>it's bigger than 99% of the effect sizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you never encounter in the social </v>

810
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be 99.9%</v>

811
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The infectious disease rate,</v>

812
00:41:21.071 --> 00:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>the more right wing totalitarian the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

813
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

814
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.863
<v Speaker 1>why do you think they're regulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>inter personal contact and sexual </v>

815
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.190
<v Speaker 1>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

816
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

817
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to minimize disease </v>

818
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 1>transmission vectors fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're not trying to do that.</v>

819
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ad that patient,</v>

820
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 1>keep yourself out of contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep yourself isolated</v>

821
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.970
<v Speaker 2>cause it takes place within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

822
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

823
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because lots of those places,</v>

824
00:41:55.361 --> 00:41:58.240
<v Speaker 1>there've been infectious diseases for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

825
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

826
00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 1>so that's all very unsettling </v>
<v Speaker 1>information because it sheds it.</v>

827
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So what did it implies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is quite cool,</v>

828
00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it implies that the best way to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing authoritarianism is to,</v>

829
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.100
<v Speaker 1>is to instigate effective public health </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

830
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone has a sewer and a toilet and</v>

831
00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:21.094
<v Speaker 1>there's no infectious disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't any right wing </v>

832
00:42:22.991 --> 00:42:25.210
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians anymore cause they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

833
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be an overstatement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

834
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.280
<v Speaker 1>but it also might not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.114
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely one of the prerequisites</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the kind of stability and </v>

836
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:35.554
<v Speaker 1>productivity that's characterized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west is that all of our cities has have </v>

837
00:42:38.591 --> 00:42:40.990
<v Speaker 1>functional sewer systems and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a toilet.</v>

838
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.243
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that makes a big </v>

839
00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you don't have one.</v>

840
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Is it fair to say?</v>

841
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Well it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should bring it out.</v>

842
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

843
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm a reasonably orderly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

844
00:43:02.281 --> 00:43:06.420
<v Speaker 1>if I go into a place that's chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's chaotic and,</v>

845
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and filthy,</v>

846
00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:08.963
<v Speaker 1>I have a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really powerful impulse to tromp around </v>

847
00:43:11.701 --> 00:43:13.680
<v Speaker 1>until it's fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

848
00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:14.514
<v Speaker 1>Cause it just strikes me as things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating in a bad direction around </v>

849
00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:20.160
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

850
00:43:20.161 --> 00:43:21.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

851
00:43:21.631 --> 00:43:22.464
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I most outstanding </v>

852
00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:25.560
<v Speaker 1>characteristics as orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

853
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up there.</v>

854
00:43:27.451 --> 00:43:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a reasonably conscientious person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

855
00:43:30.031 --> 00:43:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a visceral response and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral responses,</v>

856
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 1>something needs to be done about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and you can see how that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness.</v>

858
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.133
<v Speaker 1>So what we've been trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes conscientious people </v>

859
00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:46.530
<v Speaker 1>motivated because conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts life success.</v>

860
00:43:46.531 --> 00:43:47.071
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

861
00:43:47.071 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 1>are they interested in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>

862
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's due to fullness.</v>

863
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is that a motivator?</v>

864
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.613
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking that what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious person wants is not to </v>

865
00:43:58.591 --> 00:44:01.320
<v Speaker 1>slide into the disgusting bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

866
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So imagine the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

867
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Top is pure bottom is contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

868
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you one reason.</v>

869
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.360
<v Speaker 1>If you take a given geographical locale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is even true for songbirds.</v>

870
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.680
<v Speaker 1>And you'll rank order the denisons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that locale by their dominance position.</v>

871
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you let a pathogen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals die from the bottom up,</v>

872
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</v>

873
00:44:28.351 --> 00:44:29.184
<v Speaker 1>is where all the pathogens hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's disgusting and it's </v>

874
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:36.000
<v Speaker 1>morally impure and you're bad if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there,</v>

875
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.060
<v Speaker 1>which is really a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

876
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 1>many ways it's your fault you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

877
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 1>and are not going to be there no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

878
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I think what the conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is doing is fleeting the bottom.</v>

879
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to get to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>except that that's the farthest away you</v>

880
00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 1>can get from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a purity motivation.</v>

881
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.183
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know that yet because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to figure out how to </v>

882
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:00.470
<v Speaker 1>motivate industrious people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lounge.</v>

883
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 1>So which is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

884
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Because conscientiousness predicts life </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

885
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:06.414
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that you could find a task </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lab that conscientious people </v>

886
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>would do better than non conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

887
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 1>We've tried dozens of things and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to do it.</v>

888
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:15.624
<v Speaker 1>So now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make people embarrassed </v>

889
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.114
<v Speaker 1>and ashamed and see if we could get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like donate more to a charity if we </v>

890
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on the idea that what's motivating</v>

891
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:29.181
<v Speaker 1>the conscientious person is a flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>from contamination could easily be.</v>

892
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a twist.</v>

893
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It was a twist.</v>

894
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never,</v>

895
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd never forecast in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of these things.</v>

896
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.080
<v Speaker 1>But the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a place of chaos and fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the underworld that's hell,</v>

898
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it's full of sulfur is odors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

900
00:45:45.611 --> 00:45:50.611
<v Speaker 1>it's not only terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also disgusting and it's associated</v>

901
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 1>symbolically with disgusting elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body as well.</v>

902
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and purity,</v>

903
00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:58.524
<v Speaker 1>obviously sexual purity for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is certainly a hygiene purity add </v>

904
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 1>mixture and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

905
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it's flight from contamination and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>

906
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:10.314
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are sexually transmitted </v>

907
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:12.084
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a major vector of disease </v>

908
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 1>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that with the AIDS outbreak.</v>

909
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

910
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.193
<v Speaker 1>without us airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't have been any aids </v>

911
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:24.000
<v Speaker 1>outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 1>jet planes plus promiscuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

913
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 1>we almost generated a virus that took </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the whole planet.</v>

915
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke when these things escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their,</v>

916
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 1>from their little box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:38.971
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

918
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 1>why aren't people allowed to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual life they want?</v>

919
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disease there,</v>

920
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.713
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission and promiscuity is </v>

921
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:52.560
<v Speaker 1>exponential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

922
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

923
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 1>well that's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

924
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>

925
00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.003
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

926
00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I dunno how many hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have died from aids,</v>

927
00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's lots</v>

928
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.660
<v Speaker 3>so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

929
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.253
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be doing a lot of </v>

930
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:16.560
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

931
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a primary problem of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing Isis.</v>

932
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's the feminine underworld from </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

933
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

934
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because there there's a negative</v>

935
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 1>element to both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't differentiated properly,</v>

936
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 1>then the woman can carry that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>load.</v>

937
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 1>That happened to some degree with eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

938
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

939
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.293
<v Speaker 1>in the genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting because if you read </v>

940
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:44.050
<v Speaker 1>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about that later.</v>

941
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>The person who looks really bad in </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis isn't eve.</v>

942
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 1>The person who looks really bad is Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

943
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:53.840
<v Speaker 1>So either offers him the apple and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dance.</v>

944
00:47:53.841 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 1>He takes it but then God comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

945
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 1>He's all self conscious now and so is </v>
<v Speaker 1>eve.</v>

946
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.333
<v Speaker 1>And so God comes along to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk without him like he's used to </v>

947
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:03.280
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

948
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.113
<v Speaker 1>And Adam is hiding in the bushes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's naked and he doesn't want God to </v>

949
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so God calls them on,</v>

950
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it says like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey buddy,</v>

951
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I can see through bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

952
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.490
<v Speaker 1>come out here where I can talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>

953
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.393
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a naked,</v>

954
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I can't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

955
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 1>how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Adam being there,</v>

956
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 1>heroic creature that he was said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that woman you made for me,</v>

957
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

958
00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the villain in that story?</v>

959
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Speaker 1>He such a weasel that when he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>called on his disobedience,</v>

960
00:48:32.381 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he does is blame the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

961
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.261
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

962
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's an archetypal story.</v>

963
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

964
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptations of Eve,</v>

965
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:42.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the rapist to blame the </v>

966
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness of the woman for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape.</v>

967
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like the devil made me do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

968
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.193
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to distinguish one </v>

969
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:54.004
<v Speaker 1>form of negative from another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what we're going to do when </v>

970
00:48:56.111 --> 00:49:00.280
<v Speaker 1>we go through the symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation process is put things in</v>

971
00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 1>their proper place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that's this,</v>

972
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.460
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong direction.</v>

973
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.383
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you this one diagram and </v>

974
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:17.470
<v Speaker 1>then we'll stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

975
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.950
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

976
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the map of the symbolic sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

977
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So what you have in the very background </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dragon of chaos.</v>

978
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.233
<v Speaker 1>That's the absolute unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about it is the chaos </v>

979
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 1>from which everything else emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the unknown unknowns.</v>

980
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

981
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a feminine layer and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great mother.</v>

982
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And the great mother has a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

983
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:58.170
<v Speaker 1>She's mother of all things and she has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative aspect and she's,</v>

984
00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.593
<v Speaker 1>she's angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tie Amat the force of death that pulls </v>

985
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 1>all biological creatures back into her </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp,</v>

986
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>creation and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on top of that,</v>

987
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>there's culture and culture protects you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the great mother.</v>

988
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Just like with OCI receipt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis stays in the underworld where she </v>

989
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:15.934
<v Speaker 1>belongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But culture has a negative element in a </v>

990
00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:19.390
<v Speaker 1>positive element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

991
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 1>it's patriarchal represented by </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine sagers.</v>

992
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.280
<v Speaker 1>But it has an element that offers order </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an element that offers tyranny.</v>

993
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's always a balance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two.</v>

994
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think hooray order.</v>

995
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

996
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 1>oh no tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're both right,</v>

997
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:38.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every organization tends towards</v>

998
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and supports you at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

999
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right on top of that.</v>

1000
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:43.993
<v Speaker 1>There's the archetipal individual that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also represented in masculine form for </v>

1001
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:49.034
<v Speaker 1>reasons that we'll get into later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a positive and a negative </v>

1002
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:52.034
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the positive is the creative </v>

1003
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 1>explorer moving out into the darkness </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Eyes Open.</v>

1004
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the counterpart of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1005
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing you shake hands with </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're Romeo Dallaire and you shake</v>

1006
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:06.980
<v Speaker 1>hands with the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the individual too.</v>

1007
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about this,</v>

1008
00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:10.664
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I really like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this map is that I think it's the </v>

1009
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 1>antidote for radiology.</v>

1010
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>map it theologies onto this map,</v>

1011
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 1>but the ideology is only give you half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

1012
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So like the last wing story would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely,</v>

1013
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 1>virginal mother nature being tyrannized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the evil corporations as civilization</v>

1014
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 1>advances led by the adversarial </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1015
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:38.443
<v Speaker 1>But the right wing story is the heroic </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual bringing order into chaos to </v>

1016
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 1>avoid the destructive element of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the natural world.</v>

1017
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 1>So That's like the frontier myth that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1018
00:51:49.521 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that settled the United States,</v>

1019
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:55.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroic pioneers moving civilization into</v>

1020
00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 1>the chaotic unknown and just slam those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two together.</v>

1021
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.503
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got the real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that nature slash the unknown </v>

1022
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:08.771
<v Speaker 1>is a creative source of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it will pull you into pieces if,</v>

1023
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 1>if it has the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then culture,</v>

1024
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can talk and it's warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better be happy with culture,</v>

1025
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.983
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you and crunch you and try to turn </v>

1026
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you into a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1027
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:23.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's going to do.</v>

1028
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's you,</v>

1029
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1030
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you're wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1031
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great creature,</v>

1032
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:32.810
<v Speaker 1>but look the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1033
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.170
<v Speaker 1>and that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1034
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think the archetipal stories do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely job of continually bringing those</v>

1035
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 1>elements together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>

1036
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's good enough.</v>
