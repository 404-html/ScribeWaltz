Speaker 1:          00:00          I don't know. You've probably come across this little diagram in the book and it's quite a complicated diagram, so I'm going to just walk you through it a bit and then he'll tell you the Egyptian story. So this is, this is a sequence of interconnected causal loop. So the question might be, well, how does morality emerged from the bottom? And I would say, well, especially the morality that's associated with assuming that attention is something that's sacred, roughly speaking. Okay, so managing, you'll see someone reading engaged in something, you might think, oh, I'd really like to be engaged like that, which is what you would think, right? Because everyone wants that. It's like, I'd like to be engaged. Okay, so then you might think, well, this person looks like they're fully alive. Something like that. They're not being obsessed by catastrophes and all that. They're into what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:49          What's that like? Okay. You'd say, well, that's associated with creative exploration. And then you might say, well, why is creative exploration useful in the answer to that is because it can generate adaptive behavior of all sorts. Okay, so then what? Well then you can imitate the adaptive behavior because we can use our bodies as representational devices. So we act out the person who's interested in something. So that's actually in large part why people like to buy art, you know? So lots of people I've seen by arc, they liked to buy art because they also have some contact with the artists and they want to have some contact methey artists because it's kind of cool to have contact with an artist. It brings something into their life. And the artist is definitely someone who's outside standard hierarchies. That's sort of what defines an artist. So then once you imitate the adaptive behavior, then you can play around with the invitations a bit and you can ritualize them and then you can dramatize them and dramas and interesting thing.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Once it gets, once it gets formalized, you know, because basically what you're doing, imagine little kids, they get together, they lay out some rules for pretend play. Then they run us pretend play simulation. Then imagine like little shakespeare junior is off to the side and he's taken some notes and maybe he watches six or seven different pretend play episodes and he thinks, well, this was the most interesting part of that and this was the most interesting part of that. This was the most interesting part of that. I think I'll put those all together, make them coherent. We'll have a really good story. And what the story is is an articulated representation of a dramatic representation of a set of procedures. It's two orders of abstraction, right? And you know this because when you read a book, I mean this doesn't happen to me anymore because I think I've read too many books, but I can remember when I was a kid, when I was reading a book of fiction, it was as if the, what was being described was playing out in my imagination as embodied fingers. So you know, sometimes you go to a movie of a book, you've read and you think, oh, that person doesn't look anything like the person in the book, you know, because you have a representation of what the person is like. I found as I've gotten older that, and I don't understand this is I don't have that anymore, but I still understand the books so I must've become so automatized. But that's all gone. It's, it's, it's a loss I would say. But anyways, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          03:13          You see that once you get the bloody dram or written down or even when you can say it, when you can tell a story, you're so close to having the, the pattern revealed in an articulated manner. You can't say what the pattern is, but you can describe it well once you can describe it, well, you're right next to philosophy, right? As soon as we have a set of dramas that we can all agree on, especially once they get written down, then we can start thinking about the dramas. And that's when philosophy enters the stage. As far as I can tell, it's like the groundwork for look for philosophy has already laid by centuries and centuries of human interaction. And we keep out abstracting that up to the point where we can represent it and then we can pull out general principles and we discussed them and debate about them.

Speaker 1:          03:57          But that's the birth of philosophy and all of those levels interplay. Like it's not just the causal direction isn't just from creative exploration forward. It's each time you add a new level that interacts with the previous level, right? So you can talk about how you're going to play or you can analyze literature, you know, or you can think about what you're going to write about. So, so each time you add another level of the capacity for abstraction, you make the whole system much more dynamic and complex. So the causal links, that's why there's all those little arrows on outside. All of those areas are interacting with each other. So yes,

Speaker 2:          04:39          Rama.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Yeah. Too many arrows. Yeah. Let me show you something here. This is quite cool. See that? Did I show you that before? Oh, this is so cool. It's mind boggling, this thing. Okay. So the horizontal line, you see all the little squiggles that are underneath that. Okay. Every one of those lines is a biblical verse. And the length of the line corresponds to how many references there is to that verse in other places in the book. So you look at the bloody thing, man, that thing's hyperlinked, like mad. And that's partly why the book, you know, think about this book like a normal book. Really what you do. No, you go see a movie and there's a timeline. There's a beginning and a middle and an end, but it's a losery, right? Because the person who was writing the movie saw the whole thing at once.

Speaker 1:          05:29          And so they could use their knowledge of the ending to fiddle around with the beginning and they could use their knowledge of the middle to fiddle around with the end. That doesn't happen in real life. So you can lay this out. Now imagine you've got a story and it's like 5,000 years old and a 150,000 people have edited it and they all knew the end and the middle and the beginning and they just go like this. Well, this means this and that refers to this. And that refers to this and that refers to this and this means that. And well you end up with that. It's like it's infinitely dance. You can't get to the bottom of it. There's no way. And really it's hyperlinked. So you, I could, you could say that in a sense. The Bible is the world's first fully hyperlink document. Weird. So,

Speaker 3:          06:15          Yup.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Yes. And, and part of that's part of, that's actually conscious. Like one of the things that people do when they're criticizing Christianity is say, well if you look at the gospel stories for example, there'll be a little story about Christ and then there'll be this line that says thus fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy and the biblical scholars say, look, that was put in later. And the reason it was put in later was because the,

Speaker 1:          06:46          the hypothesis of the savior is nested in the Old Testament and it keeps partially coming true with all these profits. So a profit is like a partial savior. And in the Old Testament prophets are just popping up like mad. And usually what happens is Israel gets degenerate for one reason or another. It's because the king isn't being a good martech basically. And so then a prophet who's very insightful, like Nietzsche or Dostoevsky pops up and says, hey, you're not paying attention to the orphans and widows and you better get your act together because otherwise God's going to come along and like flood. Yeah, out or your enemies are going to stream in. And of course, often weirdly enough, the king's listen because they think, God, this person is either completely insane or God's talking to him because otherwise he wouldn't be marching into the court when I could have his head cut off with one 10th of a second orders. So often they kind of half pay attention. But what happens, and this is northrop fries interpretation fundamentally, is that the whole testament is the construction of an empire. Israel, it's collapsed because of its failure to follow the fundamental moral order. Then it rises again, collapses, rises again, collapses. The first story like that is the flood, right? And that's a really, really old story. You know, the Bible doesn't get quasi historic until Abraham, the stories before that. So that would be like the creation of the world, Adam and eve. Um, the Tower of Babel, Cain and Abel.

Speaker 1:          08:17          No, no. That's later Noah. And then, then the Abrahamic story start. And that's more like the history of Israel. Even though it's also mythologized the first set of stories, man, those things are old. Who knows how old, really old, 50,000 years old. Maybe they're old. So anyways, what happens across time is that people have all these biblical books and it's like what the Mesopotamians had to do in order to organize their society. It's like, oh, we've got all these writings, they're all sacred. Hypothetically, they contradict each other. They don't seem to be in any order. Like what are we going to do about that? And so then there's this collaboration of minds across to think, oh hell, he kind of looks like this might go there and then this might go there. And this refers to that. And this refers to that. And so it is that it's tar, it's trying to, it's the collective imagination of humanity trying to make a coherent story out of experience. That's what it is. And you know, it's, you might say, well it's our best guess. Is it true? It depends on what you mean by true, right. That's a very, very tricky question. Partly this, the question it's trying to answer is how should you act? Let's not the story that's not a scientific story, but it's a bloody important question. Okay, good. So Egypt, I felt like you didn't know the story of, what was his name?

Speaker 3:          09:45          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:45          who discovered buoyancy? He ran through the streets. Eureka. Who was that? Archimedes. Okay. So archimedes was trying to figure out how to measure the volume of something. And He, I think he wanted to figure out how you determined whether an alloy was pure gold or not. And so you'd have to get the volume of the damn thing and then maybe at a clump of metal, there's no way you could measure. And then he figured out that if you had a tub full of water and you drop the thing in it, the amount of water that spilled over the edges would tell you exactly how big the thing was. And then you could weigh your thing, your metal, and you could tell what proportion of it was gold. And so he was so thrilled about that. He theoretically, he discovered that when he was in a bathtub, he got it in, the water spilled over. He ran naked through the streets of whatever townie was in yelling. Eureka. Eureka. I've got it. So, so that's an insight, right? So I felt like that when I, when I read this Egyptian story and I thought I figured it out. So because I thought, wow, that's mind boggling. So here's the story. So we got to show you some of these characters.

Speaker 3:          10:46          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          10:55          So the guy in the middle, that's, so cyrus, he's on this pillar. So he started, represents what pillars represent, which is what whole things up. Okay. And then the guy on the left, that's horace and horace is, he's got the head of a forking. Okay. And the reason for that is that falcons fly around so they're not attached to the ground. And they can really, really, really, really see, like they're birds of prey in there, about the only animal who can see better than us. So like rap doors, birds of prey, they can see like mad. Think an eagle. If an eagle was standing on the top of the empire state building, it could see a dime on the sidewalk. So it's like Gold Eagle. And then the one on the right is isis and Isis is queen of the underworld. Okay. And then there's one other character here.

Speaker 1:          11:42          You see that's a Madonna and child. Basically. There are that character. That's seth and seth is, he's a bad guy now. No one knows what the hell seth is. You know, nobody's been able figure out what kind of weird animal that is. So who knows? But those are the four main characters. Okay. So now you got to know how they interact here. So you'd go to Cyrus and the store. There's variants of this story, many, but I'm telling you like one sort of canonical variant. So story of Osiris and Isis and horace. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, and this is the story upon which Egyptian civilization was based, although it was a very old civilization, right? Lasted for thousands of years. So Cleopatra was last time from Cleopatra to now than there is between Cleopatra and the Pyramids. So that kind of tells you how old Egypt was. It's like old major civilization lasted a long time, had a powerful story, a powerfully organizing story, right.

Speaker 1:          12:51          Way older than like, then the history of Judeo Christian civilization, say 2000 years old, older than Chinese history. It's old. China goes back a long ways though. So, you know, maybe it's not older than China, but it's something there. Anyways, well cyrus, so, oh cyrus was that God who established Egypt? Okay, so he's like George Washington. If you had George Washington 2000 years from now, then George Washington would be able to cyrus because he'd be mythologized, right? So basically, oh, cyrus represents all the good things that the Egyptians did to establish order from chaos and set up the society. So Cyrus, he's a great, he was a great hero when he was young and he did all sorts of heroic things. And he established the state of Egypt and he rules over it, but he's kind of old and he can't see as well as he used to. And he's little on the muddle headed side, but worse than that.

Speaker 1:          13:49          So He's archaic and anachronistic. And so what that indicates is that, well, just like the Americans are experiencing with their constitution, it's like, hmm, things a little on the old side. What should we do with it while we should update? It's like, well we don't want to update it in a way that makes all chaos break forth, you know? So anyways, things get our cat just because they exist, right? So if you set up a system of rules, it's tea, it's supposed to adapt to this environment, but the environment keeps wiggling around, right? So you have to chase it with the rules and you have to update the rules as the landscape changes. And that's the biologists call that the red queen problem, roughly speaking, which is a reference to Alice in wonderland. So Alice goes down the rabbit hole and she finds the Red Queen. That's the queen of chaos, Mother Nature.

Speaker 1:          14:35          And what, and she's always chopping people's heads off for arbitrary reasons, like, yeah. Um, and one of the things she tells Ellis' here in my kingdom, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place. And that's the chronic human problem. It's the problem of entropy, right? Is that you build something static but things aren't static. So even if it's a useful thing you've built, first of all, you got to maintain the hell out of it cause it's just going to fall apart. But worse than that, the environments running away from it. And so your computers have oh, cyrus problems all the time. It's like they're just lovely for the first three years that you own them and then their bricks. And it's because the underlying landscape is so dynamic that the structure you loses its validity. You can almost watch it lose its validity, right?

Speaker 1:          15:20          As a consequence of the exponential increase in computer intelligence. So Cyrus great guy, when he was young, little old fashioned and worse, he's willfully blind. Now the Egyptians insisted on that and that's so cool. It's actually you can be held responsible in an English common law court for willful blindness. And what willful blindness is. The failure is the failure to realize something you could have realized. So for example, if you're a CEO and you have a crooked chief financial officer and you think maybe he's crooked, but you decide, well, I'm not going to look at the books because then I know, and then his malfeasance is brought to light and you say, well, I didn't know the prosecutor will say, yeah, but you could have. And you knew you could have and you didn't. And so you're, you're culpable for your own ignorance. It's like that's such a brilliant idea.

Speaker 1:          16:16          The Egyptians figured this out. Oh, cyrus is not only old and decrepit and a little on the Alzheimer he side, but he won't pay attention to things. He's had it with that. He's willfully blind. And that's a problem because he has a brother who's the evil brother of the rightful king, which is a theme that you're all familiar with. If you watched your Disney movies, he's like scar in the lion king, right? Same Guy. Or in a Latin, there's, uh, some bad character. I don't remember his name. Alert. That's the guy. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, he's the, he's the evil or, or Darth vader in star wars. It's like, it's, he's an archetypal figure. He's the evil brother of the rightful king. Now, why does the rightful king has an evil brother? That's easy. It's because organizations tend towards decay and corruption across time.

Speaker 1:          17:08          That's what they do. And the Socialists are really on this with regards to corporations, right? The evil corporations, it's like, and the, and the right wingers, thank, oh no, it's evil government. So they're just projecting the archetype of the negative farther onto the respect of organizations, when in fact, it's actually a characteristic of organizations. If you don't keep an eye on the damn things, they degenerate and they become corrupt. So that's just what happens. You better stay awake to deal with that. So anyways, oh, cyrus has this evil brother named seth and seth, the name Seth Becomes Satan through the Coptic Christians much, much, much, much later. So he's like the precursor to the, to the devil, roughly speaking. Now. Oh Cyrus think staff is all right, like, like scar does or like move Fossa does with scarp underestimates his danger. Something you should never do. And so one day, oh cyrus, he's just not paying much attention and seth gets a big symitar something like that, chops them into pieces.

Speaker 1:          18:11          And then, because you can't really kill oh cyrus, because he's a god as well as being the founder of the state and the ruler, the only thing you can do is make it difficult for him to get his act back together. So what seth does is he takes so Cyrus's pieces and he scatters them all over Egypt. And the idea there is that when corruption overtakes and organization, then things fall apart. But the things aren't actually dead. You know, it's like when a corporation falls apart, all the people in it don't die. They just fragment into maybe smaller groups. Some companies get spun off or maybe they fragment all the way down to the individual level, but there's still potency left in it. And the structure is still there inside each of the individuals and the sub organizations. So you can, you can get the damn thing to fall apart, but you can't get rid of it so far. And he does that. He scatters these pieces everywhere. So it makes it hard for old cyrus to recollect himself or to get his act back together. So things fall apart and it's hard for you to get your act back together. That's the idea. And so, and then he rules the kingdom, which doesn't work out very well. Just like scar in the lion king, right? Because he's an evil tyrant and all things considered evil. Tyranny doesn't work that well even for the evil tyrant.

Speaker 1:          19:27          Well though you should never assume that an evil tyrant wants things to work out. Well, not even for him. So anyways, fine.

Speaker 1:          19:38          Oh, Cyrus has a wife, isis now isis, she's a major league player in ancient mythology. Isis as queen of the underworld. And it's a real costs up. If you look at archaic cultures, whether the top God is the guy with the order guy like, oh cyrus or the top God is Isis. He's queen of the underworld. It's like it's 50 50 for sure. And well, isis represents chaos and oh, Cyrus represents order and they should be in balance. Like, you know, if they're in a harmonious balance like Appsu and Tiamat and they produce all sorts of productive things and if one overwhelms the other, well then it's not so good. So they should be a harmonious couple. Okay. But now I was, cyrus is dead whack. He's chopped up and spread everywhere. So op isis comes out of the underworld. Well that's what happened when the Americans invaded Iraq. It's like, wow, well cyrus has gone. Yeah, but what about Isis? Oh, we forgot about isis up she comes chaos. It's like, there it is. So is it better?

Speaker 1:          20:40          No, I don't obviously. So you never want to forget about isis. So anyways, Isis, not that happy that, oh sorry, Russ has gone because that's her husband, right? And she thinks, well that's not so, so helpful. So what she does is she runs around Egypt trying to find his fellas. And the reason for that is because it, it's the seminal apparatus, right? It's the seed of the new thing. So what she does is she finds his Phallus and she makes herself pregnant with it. And so bang, she goes back down to the underworld. But now she's impregnated. So what does that mean? It means when remarkable things fall apart into chaos, the seeds of something new or potentially planted. Okay. So fine. She gives birth to horace, like Arthur, he's outside his rightful kingdom, just like Simba standard routine, just like Harry Potter, right? He's outside his kingdom.

Speaker 1:          21:34          And the reason for that is you're all outside your kingdom. It's like the Kingdom is Sorta old and archaic and doesn't quite fit the circumstances now. And it's not all that fair to you and it's sort of arbitrary. And so you grow up to some degree and [inaudible] opposition to it. So it's just an archetypal story. So this, this character, she finally gives birth to this character and that. So Cyrus and no cyrus, he's, he's quite the character. He's that. So sorry. That's all. Sorry. His name is horace and that's horace there. And she's the benevolent goddess of all new things as well as being the terrible goddess of the underworld. And she knows she's bringing up horace. Horace, where is he here?

Speaker 1:          22:19          There he is. So Horace is, this is fulcan cause he can fly around and see everything and he's also the eye of the Egyptians. And so it's like, he's like Marduk these eyes he can see, okay, so then horace grows up and he's thinking, Huh, not fond the world stuff. I'd like to have my kingdom back, my rightful kingdom. And now he's different than oh cyrus. And the reason these different is because he can see and normally can he see, he will see. And that's a whole different thing. So Horace is not willfully blind and that's a drag because he can see what's happened to the kingdom and he can see south and that's not so good. It's like you're in in Romeo declares position then aren't you? You have to shake hands with the devil. And you know what happened to Romeo, dell error when that happened.

Speaker 1:          23:04          It's like post term. He's a general right. I hope you know all know this, you know he was there in Rwanda when everybody got massacred in the u. N didn't step in property. Had to watch all that. It was like post traumatic stress disorder instantly. So it's like if your eyes open and you can see evil, it's like you better look out because if you're face to face with real malevolence the probability that that will damage your brain is very high. You know? And one of the things that's very interesting if you think about post traumatic stress disorder is that often in soldiers it's, it's, it's a consequence of something they did, not something they saw. So they'll go out in the battlefield and they'll find out there far more barbaras and cruel and destructive than they ever possibly imagined. And then they, how are they going to fit that into like corn fed farm boy from Iowa skied, you know, they can't do it.

Speaker 1:          23:54          Poof, the whole structure is gone. It's very stressful to find that sort of thing out. And the people I've had in my practice who have had ptsd, it's almost always because they were subjected to some kind of malevolence like it was, they came face to face with something evil. And in one case, for example, I had a client whose boyfriend was going to rape her. She was naive beyond belief and what [inaudible] gave her a posttraumatic stress disorder wasn't what he did because she could fight him off. She happened to be bigger than he was. It was the look of malevolence on his face when he attacked her. That was enough and it she had severe psychosomatic syndrome symptoms for four years. After that, she couldn't even sleep. Her whole body would vibrate and it took a lot of untangling before we figured out that it was the look on his face and I've seen that happen. Other times it's like becoming face to face with this sort of thing is no joke. So horace can see, but luckily he's a long ways from it. Yeah. Yes, I can imagine.

Speaker 2:          25:16          He ended up becoming making,

Speaker 1:          25:27          right. That's a nat tay. That's to put the chaos back in an Ed. One thing you might want to know about Hitler is that one day in World War One, he got a medal for bravery in world war one by the way. So Hitler was all sitting around with his buddies in a trench and he went off to relieve himself. And when he came back they were all dead because the shell had landed right in the middle. And so that gave him the idea that he was saved for something special. And I can tell you if that happened to you, you would feel, cause what are you using your options. It's a horrible, chaotic, nasty place where brutal things happen at random. That's one option. Or You were saved because something special is waiting for you. So like it's toss up which of those two you're going to pick, but you're going to pick one of them.

Speaker 1:          26:06          So anyways, okay, so horace, he can see sec too bad for him. So he goes back to the kingdom and he has like vicious fight with scent and sets like they're pretty evenly matched. And so the idea there is that even if your horse, like son of the, of order and son of chaos and your eyes are open, it's like it's a pretty evil, it's a pretty even battle. So they're fighting away and seth gets to apprehend and he tears out one of horses eyes. And then horace, which is pretty damaging, you know, that's a drag to lose an eye. So his vision is damaged by his with evil. But Horace keeps fighting and eventually he prevails and it gets the eye back and he banishes seth to the Nether regions of the kingdom. It's like in the lion king where you know everything, the light touches is the kingdom and then there's the nether regions is that's where your sandal seth.

Speaker 1:          26:58          So you can't get rid of him, can't kill him. He's permanent because societies will always tend towards corruption. Best you can do is get the damn guy under control for a while. Okay, so now horace has his eye and you think and of story, pretty good story. You could animate that. He just slapped the old I back in his hand, you know, pick up the sector and he'd rule happily ever after. Now it isn't what happens. What happens instead is he take, he keeps his eye and he goes back to the underworld and he finds those Cyrus's ghosts down there and it's sort of sitting there like this, you know, it's cause it's all chopped up and you know, it's a weird combination because in one plane it's, it's a chopped up body that's distributed everywhere. But down in the underworld, it's like a ghost, the spirit, but it's not very animated.

Speaker 1:          27:47          It's sort of in the land of the dead, like Pinocchio's farther in the whale. So what does this whole horse do? Well, he gives, oh cyrus his eye. So now blind tradition can see and then he takes his father, oh cyrus backup to the surface sort of. Now they're a unit arm in arm, so to speak. And it's the, it's the combination of horizontal Cyrus that rule Egypt. And that's what the Egyptians figured out. It's like, God, that's so smart. It's like, well you need this, you need the traditions of the state, right, because you need them. They're there, they're vital, they hold back chaos. You can't just let that go because then income seth and up comes the underworld. It's like that's not good. You need that as a bulwark. But then it's old and kind of blind and it's going to tend towards corruption and fall over of its own accord.

Speaker 1:          28:42          So how do you solve that? And the answer is it pay attention and you provide dead tradition with living site. And if you do that, then you get to be the ruler of the state, the rightful ruler of the state. Now the Egyptians basically hypothesize, this took a long time, that the Pharaoh also had an immortal soul. He was the only person who did. But the immortal soul was basically the combination of Horace and oh Cyrus. So the Egyptians conceptualize that as something that was eternal. So, and it was the, it was the eternal, it was the central eternal feature of sovereignty. It's so smart. And so as long as the Pharaoh was a good horace Ando Cyrus at the same time, then he was the rightful sovereign and he was reflecting something of the utmost value. And it was a mortal. It's so smart. So what happens, interestingly, they call this the democratization of old cyrus.

Speaker 1:          29:44          So to begin with in the Egyptian state, you could only use the horace. Oh Cyrus symbolism. If you were either of the Pharaoh to begin with, or at least a high ranking aristocrat. But what happened as Egypt progressed, so to speak, as it developed across time, is that the right to use the symbolism that that was the horror. So Cyrus conjunction drifted down the dominance hierarchy. So at some point all the aristocrats got to use, it never drifted down to like women are Carmen, people are slaves or anything like that. But you know, hypothetically the Jews came out of Egypt and one of the things the Jews said that went beyond the Egyptians was that each person was, was capable, was ennobled in some sense by their potential relationship with the highest value that was gone. And when the Christian showed up. But that was universalized everyone had it, even prostitutes and slaves.

Speaker 1:          30:44          So it's so cool because what happens is these societies get the idea of, of sovereignty laid out in this phenomenal heavenly drama. And they identify that with the thing that's at the top of the hierarchy, which is what they should do. But then what happens across time is everybody wakes up and thinks, oh, that's so interesting. It's characteristic of the Pharaoh. It's characteristic of what should be sovereign. It's characteristic of what the highest value is, but it's actually characteristic of everybody and it's, it's almost impossible to overstate how important that is because our whole conception of the idea of natural rights is predicated on the idea that there's something about you as an individual individual whose value is inviolable so much that it doesn't even matter what you do. So if I see you brutally murdered 20 people and there's 50 eye witnesses and we know for sure you did it, you still have to be treated as if your central essence is of tremendous value and you have to be given due process.

Speaker 1:          31:50          The whole law bows down before that. And so then you think, well, do people believe this? This sort of horace oh cyrus combination and its relationship to what's ultimately valuable and the fact that that's embodied in every person. It's like they certainly act like they believe it. And if, if they ever encounter a violation of that in practice, especially social practice, everybody's jumping up and down in complaining. It's like you're trampling on my rights. What do you mean? Where'd those come from? What exactly? What are they and are they real or not? And if they're not real well, then I can trample over them all I want because they're not real. But if they, and then we can just have an argument about what human beings are like, but if they are real and they're reflective, an underlying principle that's continually attempting to manifest itself in a sense from the bottom up, you better not break the rules because you're really going against the cosmic order. So that's the Egyptian story. It's like, oh, it's mind boggling. It's no wonder that story had enough dynamism to, to propel a whole culture across several thousand years. It's like it's a staggering achievement.

Speaker 2:          33:06          Ready today is sort of a primary,

Speaker 1:          33:20          yeah, don't. So that's a really good, that's a really good observation. That's just one of the things that I really, it's something new that I've figured out about all of this in the last five years. For a long time, I still haven't got this right. It's like, okay, what is your reaction when one of those principles is violated? So this is like the terror management question, right? Well, for the terror management people, it's fear, but there's a real problem with that because conservatives tend to be less neurotic than liberals and conservatives who have more of a propensity for right wing authoritarianism are more likely to get upset when rules are violated. But the rules seem to be, so, I think it's more, or I thought that it was more, no, no, it's not exactly. If your rules get violated, it's not exactly fear, although fears part of it, it's the disintegration of your motivational states into general preparation for, for readiness.

Speaker 1:          34:14          So that's more like a generalized stress response and so everything goes on so that you're able to deal with what happens next. It's like Gottman's married couples when they're the ones that are going to get divorced, right? They're very calm on the surface. But underneath it's like the underworld, all hell is broke loose, but then there's been a twist in that because there's a bunch of data coming together from all over the world that basically goes like this is that right wing authoritarianism seems to be based on purity and purity is discussed control and there's a deep biological route route for that. Like people who are disgust sensitive and concerned with purity have better standards of hygiene and they do tend to live longer, but they're also very much against temperamentally against any form of sexual contact. It isn't bounded by the social contract and they don't like foreigners, but that's all a clump.

Speaker 1:          35:09          It's all the same thing. And then we've found recently, we haven't published this yet, we've found recently that we know conservatives are more conscientious than liberals. And then we found that conscientiousness fragments into industriousness and orderliness, which was great because people have been wondering for five decades how you plug the proclivity for right wing authoritarianism into the general personality structure. And it's complicated because if you're a radical liberal like a lefty, those aren't liberals. Sorry, radical lefty, a communist. You can be just, it seems like you can be just as authoritarian as you would be if you were a fascist. So you know, that hasn't been quite sorted out yet, but it's the orderliness that seems to make people have this right wing proclivity and it does look like what they're trying to do is control discussed. So yes. So what, what the violation of that order, a huge chunk of it seems to be in this entirely new negative emotion system that we've only been untangling for 20 years and it's not associated with neuroticism.

Speaker 1:          36:15          Liberals are actually more neurotic than conservatives. You know, when you could say, well that's because the conservatives are so well protected. It's like, no, no, you, you can't post hoc use your theory to predict the opposite of what you would have predicted before the data comes in. And it's like, no, conservatives are, they should be more physiologically reactive and there's some evidence that they are, but it does really seem to be discussed. And so to jump ahead a little bit, when and after we'd sorted this out, now a lot of the work that was done on disgust was done by Jonathan Haidt. He's the guy that deserves the credit for the discussed purity linkage. It's a big deal. And he was pushing a study of discussed long before people were paying any attention to it. So good for him. When I was working on the orderliness discussed relationship, I was also reading this book by Hitler called Hitler's table talk.

Speaker 1:          37:05          And what it was was, uh, he would talk at his dinners and they collected it from 1939 to 1942 and he would like just spout off on whatever it was that was on his mind. And he was a very open person. So it's very lateral discussion. He was very interested in art and culture, but he was very, very orderly and he was a worshiper of willpower and orderly. People are like that like, um, anorexics are orderly to orderly. They can't even stand their own bodies. It's discussed that their bodies elicit and they prize the ability to control their bodies. And that's hyper orderliness. That's I think why it's associated. It's generally considered an upper middle class disease. And I think that's because a lot of people who are at that strata are hyper conscientious and that gets passed onto their kids and sometimes that's just too much.

Speaker 1:          37:52          Anyways, one of the things that really struck me about Hitler's writings, and it really, it really blew me away, I'll tell you, was that he has a metaphor. All of this thinking's metaphorical, and the metaphor is the area in race is a pure body, pure blood, pure uncontaminated, and it's under assault by pathogens and parasites. Now, as soon as you know that bang he's got is you've got the underlying dynamic of, of his appeal to the masses and Germans, hey, they're orderly. So you know, one of the things people say is that what happened in Germany constituted that decline of civilization, right back to barbarism. It's like, ah, maybe not. Conscientiousness is associated with productivity, quite highly correlations about 0.4, roughly the same as the correlation with Iq. So conscientiousness is a prerequisite for civilization. And you can think, well, why would you be disgust sensitive and an orderly?

Speaker 1:          38:57          And the answer might be, well, how much of your grain do you want rats and mice to eat because they eat lots of it, right? And keeping the insects out of food store, that's really, really hard. So if you're going to store things up, which is what you're going to do, if you're going to be civilized, you better start to be concerned with hygiene, you know? So those things are gonna go together. Well, Hitler was hyper orderly and hyper disgust sensitive. He'd washes, he bathed four times a day and he was very, very happy about the ability to stand in the back of his car, has prayed car and keep his arm out like this for eight hours. He thought of that is the triumph of the will. You know when the will seem to be associated with this pro propensity towards orderliness. So another thing that's really interesting and, and I still don't exactly know what to make of this because it has complicated my conceptualization because a lot of what I'm going to show you is based on fear and horror and horror is more like fear plus discussed.

Speaker 1:          39:54          It's some, you know the difference between the Blair witch project and the Texas chainsaw massacre. They're both horror movies, but one is pure fear and the other is almost pure discussed. So disgust seems to be a huge element of this and it is a primary response by orderly people to the violation of moral norms. Now here's something weird. There was a paper published in Plos one about a year ago and what these people did was they, they did I think I within and across country survey, and this wasn't in developed countries. So the question was how much infectious disease was there in each of these geographical locales? And the next question was how right wing were the people who occupied those areas at the individual level? So they weren't interested in what the government was like. And what they found was that the correlation between the prevalence of infectious diseases and right wing authoritarianism at the individual level was 0.6 it's like, and if you know anything about statistics, when you see 0.6 you just fall over at hyperventilate because that never happens. It's an effect size that's, it's bigger than 99% of the effect sizes that you never encounter in the social sciences. It might be 99.9% higher. The infectious disease rate, the more right wing totalitarian the population. Why? Well, why do you think they're regulating inter personal contact and sexual behavior? Why? Well, think about it. You know, they're trying to minimize disease transmission vectors fundamentally. Now they're not trying to do that. You know what I mean? It's an ad that patient, keep yourself out of contact, keep yourself isolated

Speaker 2:          41:49          cause it takes place within a generation.

Speaker 1:          41:51          Well, I don't know. I don't know that you know, because lots of those places, there've been infectious diseases for a very long period of time. So, but anyway, so that's all very unsettling information because it sheds it. So what did it implies? And this is quite cool, it implies that the best way to control right wing authoritarianism is to, is to instigate effective public health policy. So if you all, if everyone has a sewer and a toilet and there's no infectious disease, there aren't any right wing authoritarians anymore cause they're not necessary. Now that might be an overstatement, but, but it also might not be, you know, it's definitely one of the prerequisites for the kind of stability and productivity that's characterized the west is that all of our cities has have functional sewer systems and everybody has a toilet. It's like, it turns out that makes a big difference, especially when you don't have one.

Speaker 2:          42:48          Is it fair to say?

Speaker 1:          42:56          Well it should, it should bring it out. You know, and I'm, I'm a reasonably orderly person. You know, if I go into a place that's chaotic, especially if it's chaotic and, and, and filthy, I have a really, really powerful impulse to tromp around until it's fixed. You know? Cause it just strikes me as things are deteriorating in a bad direction around here. You know, so, and I'm not, I wouldn't say that. What am I most outstanding characteristics as orderliness, but it's, it's, it's up there. I'm a reasonably conscientious person. So yeah, it's a visceral response and the visceral responses, something needs to be done about this, you know, and you can see how that's associated with conscientiousness. So what we've been trying to figure out, what makes conscientious people motivated because conscientiousness predicts life success. It's like, well, are they interested in what they're doing?

Speaker 1:          43:48          No, it's due to fullness. Okay. So why is that a motivator? We're thinking that what the conscientious person wants is not to slide into the disgusting bottom of things. So imagine the hierarchy. Okay. Top is pure bottom is contaminated. Why? Well, I can tell you one reason. If you take a given geographical locale, this is even true for songbirds. And you'll rank order the denisons of that locale by their dominance position. And then you let a pathogen in the animals die from the bottom up, right? So the bottom of the dominance hierarchy is where all the pathogens hang out. And if that's disgusting and it's morally impure and you're bad if you're down there, which is really a conservative viewpoint, many ways it's your fault you're there, right, and are not going to be there no matter what. And so I think what the conscientious person is doing is fleeting the bottom.

Speaker 1:          44:48          They're not trying to get to the top except that that's the farthest away you can get from the bottom. And that's a purity motivation. Now we don't know that yet because we haven't been able to figure out how to motivate industrious people in the lounge. So which is weird, right? Because conscientiousness predicts life success. You'd think that you could find a task in the lab that conscientious people would do better than non conscientious people. We've tried dozens of things and not being able to do it. So now we're, we're trying to make people embarrassed and ashamed and see if we could get them to like donate more to a charity if we do that. Based on the idea that what's motivating the conscientious person is a flight from contamination could easily be. So it's quite mind boggling. Like it was a twist. It was a twist.

Speaker 1:          45:33          I, I'd never, I'd never forecast in my conceptualization of these things. But the underworld, you know, it's a place of chaos and fear, but the underworld that's hell, it's full of sulfur is odors, you know, it's, it's, it's not only terrifying, it's also disgusting and it's associated symbolically with disgusting elements of the body as well. So, and purity, obviously sexual purity for example, is certainly a hygiene purity add mixture and it's, it's, it's flight from contamination and no wonder, right. I mean there are sexually transmitted diseases. It's like a major vector of disease transmission. We saw that with the AIDS outbreak. You know, without, without us airplanes, there wouldn't have been any aids outbreak, you know, jet planes plus promiscuity. It was like, Hey, you know, we almost generated a virus that took down the whole planet. So it's no joke when these things escape from their, from their little box, you know, you might say, well, why aren't people allowed to have the sexual life they want? Well, the disease there, the relationship between disease transmission and promiscuity is exponential. That's why. So you know, you might think, well that's no reason. It's like, okay, maybe not, but

Speaker 1:          47:00          I dunno how many hundreds of millions of people have died from aids, but it's lots

Speaker 3:          47:05          so you know. Yup,

Speaker 1:          47:12          we'll do that later. We're going to be doing a lot of distinguishing of that. In fact, that's a primary problem of men distinguishing Isis. So that's the feminine underworld from evil. Right? Right. Because the, because because there there's a negative element to both of them. If you haven't differentiated properly, then the woman can carry that whole load. That happened to some degree with eve for example, in the, in the, in the genesis story, it's so interesting because if you read genesis, we're going to talk about that later. The person who looks really bad in genesis isn't eve. The person who looks really bad is Adam. No. So either offers him the apple and like a dance. He takes it but then God comes along afterwards. He's all self conscious now and so is eve. And so God comes along to have a little walk without him like he's used to doing.

Speaker 1:          48:03          And Adam is hiding in the bushes because he's naked and he doesn't want God to see. And so God calls them on, it says like, hey buddy, I can see through bushes, you know, come out here where I can talk to you. And Adam says, oh, a naked, I can't come out. And God says, how do you figure that out? And Adam being there, heroic creature that he was said, you know that woman you made for me, it's her fault. It's like, well, who's the villain in that story? He such a weasel that when he gets called on his disobedience, the first thing he does is blame the woman. It's like, yeah, yeah, well that's an archetypal story. I'll tell you that. You know, soul, the temptations of Eve, you know, it's like the rapist to blame the attractiveness of the woman for the rape. It's like the devil made me do it, you know? So anyways, it's very difficult to distinguish one form of negative from another. And partly what we're going to do when we go through the symbolic differentiation process is put things in their proper place. So I would say that's this,

Speaker 1:          49:12          nope, that's the wrong direction. Sorry, I want to show you this one diagram and then we'll stop. Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:30          There. So for me, that's the map of the symbolic sphere. Okay. So what you have in the very background is the dragon of chaos. That's the absolute unknown as such. So you can think about it is the chaos from which everything else emerges. So that's the unknown unknowns. Okay? On top of that, there's a feminine layer and that's the great mother. And the great mother has a positive aspect. She's mother of all things and she has a negative aspect and she's, she's angry. Tie Amat the force of death that pulls all biological creatures back into her grasp, creation and destruction. So on top of that, there's culture and culture protects you from the great mother. Just like with OCI receipt. Isis stays in the underworld where she belongs. But culture has a negative element in a positive element. So it's, it's patriarchal represented by masculine sagers.

Speaker 1:          50:22          But it has an element that offers order and an element that offers tyranny. And there's always a balance between those two. And so if you're a conservative, you think hooray order. And if you're a lefty, you think, oh no tyranny. And you're both right, right? Because every organization tends towards tyranny and supports you at the same time. So it's, it's right on top of that. There's the archetipal individual that's also represented in masculine form for reasons that we'll get into later, but it has a positive and a negative two. And the positive is the creative explorer moving out into the darkness with Eyes Open. And then there's the counterpart of that, which is the thing you shake hands with when you're Romeo Dallaire and you shake hands with the devil. And that's the individual too. And one of the things I would, you can think about this, but one of the things that I really like about this map is that I think it's the antidote for radiology.

Speaker 1:          51:17          And the reason for that is that you can map it theologies onto this map, but the ideology is only give you half the story. So like the last wing story would be lovely, virginal mother nature being tyrannized by the evil corporations as civilization advances led by the adversarial individual. But the right wing story is the heroic individual bringing order into chaos to avoid the destructive element of, of the natural world. So That's like the frontier myth that, that, that uh, that settled the United States, right? Heroic pioneers moving civilization into the chaotic unknown and just slam those two together. And then you've got the real problem, which is that nature slash the unknown is a creative source of everything. And it will pull you into pieces if, if it has the opportunity. And then culture, it's like you can talk and it's warm. You better be happy with culture, but the probability that it's going to take you and crunch you and try to turn you into a car, he's like, yeah, that's what it's going to do. That's what it does. And then there's you, well, yeah, you're wonderful, interesting. You know, great creature, but look the hell out. So, and that's right. That, and I think the archetipal stories do a lovely job of continually bringing those elements together, so well. Okay. So that's good enough.
