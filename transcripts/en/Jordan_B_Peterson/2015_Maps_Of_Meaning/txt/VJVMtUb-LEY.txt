Speaker 1:          00:01          So here's what, here's another proposition. You can think about what we've been doing so far in some way.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17          you can think about what we've been doing so far in some way is trying to figure out what the world is made of and to answer that, we have to think about what do you mean by the world and what do you mean by Meda? Because those, when you're asking a fundamental question like that, the terms in the question have to be specified with a high degree of accuracy or you're just chasing. You're just chasing ghosts around. So we could say, well, at one level of analysis, one level of resolutions, pretty obvious that the world, the objective world, whatever that is, is made out of atoms and democracy has said that a long time ago in Greece, right? He was the first guy that came up with the atomic theory, but he didn't say that the world was made out of atoms. He said that it was made out of atoms and space and you think, well that's, you know, obvious.

Speaker 1:          01:03          It's like, no, no, no, no. It's not that obvious because as soon as you have fundamental particles and space, you can array those particles in space and you can arrange them in patterned ways and the patterned ways are real to. The patterns are real too, so and without. Without the space, you can't do that. So Adam's plus space gives rise to something else and really what it gives rise to as far as I can tell, it's something very much like inflammation. Now, inflammation is a very complicated idea. What information is, but that's okay. We won't go into that at the moment. Do you think about music? Right? Music is like Adams of sound, right? Because they're, they're discreet. Quanta of sound, essentially their raid out in patterns across time, and obviously the pattern, the music is not just the note, it's the pattern across time.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Okay, so what are the things we might say is that, well, there's Adams in their space and there's patterns. Okay, so patterns. Now, one of the most fundamental patterns. Okay, so let's put it this way. We're going to say, well, what's your problem? How to live in the world? What's the world? Well, roughly speaking, the problem is how to live as an individual in society and nature. It's something like that. Okay, so then we're going to say, okay, if that's the actual problem, the first thing you have to do to solve that is to conceptualize society and nature and conceptualize the individual. So you have to represent them somehow. Okay, so how should you represent society and nature and the individual? And the answer to that is that's complicated. It's not obvious. Now we kinda know, for example, that one way of representing society is the dominance hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          02:58          You know, that's not only a way of representing and it's a way of being in this society, right? To talk about the dominance hierarchy is to represent it to be in a dominant turkeys, to live it. So we can take about a dominance hierarchy. Society is more than a dominance hierarchy, but you know, that's not a bad first approximation. And then we can think of the place in which those dominance hierarchies exist. We might think, well that's for lack of a better way of conceptualizing it's nature. So it's complicated because he can't actually some these concepts up in single words as far as I can tell, you have to use an array of words and an array of images because the categories are so broad that you just can't sum them up in a single concept. Okay. So you can sum them up with words and you can sum them up with images and you can sum them up with stories and, and that's, that's what we do as people. So the quest. No. So we're going to say, well, is that a, is that the fundamental question? How to live as an individual in society and nature? It's like, well, I don't know if it's the fundamental question, but it's af fundamental question. So fine. We'll go with that.

Speaker 1:          04:10          I'll go back over this a little bit later, but I'll, I'll start with this story. Yeah. Okay. So go back to the birthplace of civilization. Then we're going to tell the variant of this story that was discovered in the late 18 hundreds. It's a story about this God called Matt or Martech. So here's the basic structure of the story.

Speaker 1:          04:44          You got to primordial gods. Now the way that must have been Damien's conceptualize the world is they kinda thought about it. You know how if you're out on the field, it's flat and he kind of looked at the world. The world looks like a dome, right? That's the sky on a disk. So that's the Mesopotamian world. That's kind of the world as conceptualized by the people who wrote genesis as well. It's a dome on a disk. Okay? So the disc is land and underneath the land is water. Fresh water. Why? Well, if you dig down in the land, you hit freshwater. And then underneath that is salt water. And how do you know that? Well, you know, if you go out to the edges of the land and you find an ocean, it's salt water. So that's the hypothesis. Okay, so now as far as the Mesopotamians were concerned, the salt water in the fresh water were two gods.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Now what did they represent? Well, one of them was male and one of them was female and the female one was the salt water. The male one was the, was the freshwater. Okay? So now they kind of conceptualize that as a kind of a formless chaos, so you can kinda think of that water mixture as the chaos from which life emerged. It's something like that, but it's also the case and we should remember that w that life did merged from water and that without water you don't live. So it's, it's not, it's not a stupid idea. It's kind of low resolution idea. So is this chaotic intermingling of salt and freshwater. So that's sort of the idea. There's a chaos idea looking at the bottom of that. And so that's APP suit and tie. Matt, now the Mesopotamians don't say much about absolute and I kinda think that I think maybe that's because at that point society hadn't become so highly structured that and, and long lasting that that is a great representation of it had been formed.

Speaker 1:          06:33          I don't think that happened until the Egyptians, but I might be wrong about that. But in any case, the Mesopotamians don't say much about absolute. So what happens is tire mats down there in the depths, Sorta like the whale in Pinocchio fact. Very much like the whale in Pinocchio and uh, her husband and they're locked together in a sexual embrace. And so part of the idea here is that while the Union of opposites is necessary before something new can arise and that, that union of opposites can be conceptualized in some way sexually, you know, using male and female, because when male and female come together, something new emerges out of that and that sort of ideas like the matrix, you know, the matrix of things, that's the mother matter, mother. Things emerge out of a matrix. So, so anyways, absent soon time at are down there in the depths and they're locked together in the sexual embrace and they produce offspring and lots of them.

Speaker 1:          07:27          So that's the initial world of the gods. Now there's all sorts of gods they give rise to and we don't know a lot about them, but I'm going to make some hypotheses about the gods because you might think, well, what the hell are gods anyways, you know? And so I, I think about them as personalities, their personalities and their archetypical personalities. And so it's like, well, Venus for example, is the god of love and I'll show you some pictures of Venus. And so what does that mean exactly? Well, it's like a complex of things. Venus is how you act when you're in love. Venus is what people find sexually attractive in women. Venus is the, the possession that occurs when you're in love or when you're really attracted to someone. It's all those things. And so it's like a forest that can invade you. It's a way of perceiving.

Speaker 1:          08:14          It's a superordinate instinct. It's shared across not only human beings, but birds and bees as we all know. So it's this, it's a transcendent property and it, it can take personified forum because it can inhabit you. And so it's this thing that's sort of objective and subjective and it's also one of the fundamental elements of the world. So you might say, well there's Venus for example, and there's areas that's Mars. So that's a god of war and he's usually masculine and he's very aggressive and so. Well, he's like a, he's like the personality of, of a warrior like rage. So, so, so I kind of think about the gods, especially the more fundamental gods. There's something like primordial forces and here's a leap and I don't know about it, but I think that it's a recapitulation in some sense of individual socialization. So I think that what happens to begin with is that, you know, you're, as you emerge as an individual, you start out in a chaotic and uninformed manner and then these things come to life inside of you.

Speaker 1:          09:21          And those things are these fundamental motivational systems that we were talking about. And so they're the first products of chaos. And then those things have to get their act together. Okay. So like I said, that's a leap and I haven't been able to completely fill in the gaps there, but in any case, all these gods and goddesses get created by time at an absolute right. So then they're running around causing trouble. The first God's, they'd make a lot of racket. They're doing a lot of impulsive and crazy things and they make a lot of noise and they're not very cautious and they make a big mistake. They kill app suit and then they live on his body. Now that's a weird one, a, and you think, well, okay, what's going on there? Well, absolute is masculine and so the masculine thing seems to be associated in some way with God, the father and the dominance hierarchy, and so what does it mean if he's dead?

Speaker 1:          10:16          It means that all this chaotic activity that's disintegrated has killed the structure and so they're all now living on a corpse, which is not a good thing, and maybe they didn't know what they killed and so, so imagine they're careless. They're kind of clueless. They don't know what the hell's going on, and they break a bunch of rules and they destroy the, the, the orderly element of what initially gave rise to them and then they live on it's corpse. In. Another way of thinking about that is that that's what you guys do. You're living on a corpse. You're living on the corpse of the past, right? And it's the consequence of the activity of the dead and it's dead because it's the activity of the dead, right? I mean the library. There's no life in a library except for the people in it. The rest of it's all ghosts.

Speaker 1:          11:02          So you're living on the dead shell of the past. Okay. Anyways, these guards are all making all sorts of racket and running around and spinning up wind and dust and noise and it's really chaotic and then they kill Appsu. It's like, hmm, that's not a good idea. So absolute was also ordered. And so what happens when you kill order? When you destroy order, what happens? Up comes chaos. That's what happened in Iraq for example. Okay. So time that comes up and she thinks, I don't know about these things I created. It's like they're really noisy and annoying and careless. And uh, they went and killed up suits. He's like, he's my current Saturdays necessary. It's like, not for them. They're gone. I'm going to wipe them out. Sort of like God deciding to wipe out everybody with the flood. It's the same idea. These stories all came from the same area, right?

Speaker 1:          11:53          So it's another representation of that idea. It's also kind of have a vengeful God idea. Now you might think, well, what about this vengeful God idea? It's like, well, do you really want to have a god that's eventual? It's like that's a stupid question because you've got one whether you want one or not. So I can give you an example. So let's think about New Orleans, right? So New Orleans got hit by a hurricane and it was a natural disaster and it wiped out a big chunk of the city, right? Well, no, that isn't really right. So the Dutch live underwater basically, right? The whole bloody country is below sea level. So the dots make these huge dams and they maintain them like Matt. And here's the Dutch rule. We're going to try to calculate the worst possible storm that could possibly happen in 10,000 years, and then we're going to build those damn dikes.

Speaker 1:          12:44          So if that storm comes, we're safe. Okay. So what happens? Holland isn't underwater, so there's no natural disaster. So let's go to New Orleans. It's like, well, why did Orleans get wiped out? Well, there was a hurricane. It's like, did they know that there might be hurricanes? Yes. Did they know that? The dikes weren't big enough. Yes. Have they been complaining about it for a hundred years? Yes. Have there been things put in place to try to get the dikes better? Yes. Did that work? No. Why not? Because it's corrupt. It's a corrupt state now. All the money, they pour it in there too to help the people after the. After the flood. That didn't help them. It just disappeared. And so you can't. If the state is corrupt and the individuals within it or corrupt, it means the structure. The society is dead. It's a corpse. And what happens when you make a corpse out of your society? A corrupt corpse. Wow. That's easy. Mother Nature comes back and takes what she has and then you think, oh, isn't the world a terrible place? It's like, yeah, try not frittering away the money. See what happens.

Speaker 1:          13:53          It's part of it. Yeah. It's part of it. So there's a whole tangled up idea of murderers and so forth. We'll get into that. So anyways. Okay, so ty mass had it. She said, wow, these things aren't worth preserving. I'm going to go and wipe them out and then everything will be nice and calm and peaceful yet. And so the gods, they get wind of this, you know, and they're thinking, Hey, this isn't very good because like, she's, that's time out. We're talking about here she is mother nature, like in that inner terrible sense. And she creates everything and she kills everything. And if he decides that we're, you know, going back to where we came from, that's probably what's going to happen. So they're pretty blurry. I'm worried about this. So they get together in a kind of a council. So they're trying to organize themselves, say they get to get under under council and they think, oh well what are we going to do about this?

Speaker 1:          14:40          And so they elect, they take one of their gods and they say, you, why don't you go out there and try to, you know, keep time at, at bay and straightened her out. So one God goes out and has a big fight with tire Matt and comes back and he's old, defeated and wiped out, not work. And so then they send another God out and he's just completely useless. That doesn't work. It comes back and it was getting pretty damn desperate. They're in the realm of the original gods and so this is going on for quite a long time and while this is happening, the gods are still marrying each other and producing offspring and so forth. And one day this new sort of go onto peers on the scenes and his name is Martin and Martin is. He's a new thing. They're not really sure what to do with them and he's got.

Speaker 1:          15:24          He can really hear and he can speak magic words. And so when he says magic words, the day appears in the night disappears. And so he's got the power of speech, that's a big deal. And he's got eyes all the way around his head. You can see everywhere, it can really pay attention. So you know, and he's big and he's strong and he's tough and all those things. But the big things is he can speak and he can really seek and really pay attention. So the gods think, hmm, well he's kind of a new character, we haven't thrown anything like that at time matt yet, so let's, let's do it. So they all get together in their counsel and they bring it in and they say, well, you know, we're kind of thinking to be a good idea if you went out and fought this terrible monster, right?

Speaker 1:          16:02          And he thinks, well, you think that's a good idea, but you know, it's me on the line here so I need a price. And so the price is you make me the determiner of destiny's. Now that's an interesting phrase. Hey, and we don't know exactly know what they meant, but it's something like what I am that's Marduk is now going to be the thing that determines how things unfold. So it's sort of like, I'm going to be taught God, you may, if I'm going off to fight time at, I'm top God. In fact, that's how you can define top God taught. God is the God that can go out and fight tie imac. So the other, the other guards, they're not very happy about having to subordinate themselves to Martin, but they think beats the hell out of being eaten by ty amounts. So they say, yeah, yeah, if you, when you get to be like top God, you, you have the tablets of destiny, you can determine destiny fight fine.

Speaker 1:          16:55          So, so fine. Martin goes off and he gets his act together and it gets big net and he prepares himself and he rides forward and encounters time at. She's this great big dragon like monster thing that's her there on the, on the right left. So you can see she's kind of a dragon angel monster thing. She's like, she is a monster and what she is is really an amalgam of frightening things essentially. So. And there's Martech on the right and he's going to go give her a good whacking. And so he goes out there and the first thing he does, and this is quite cool, he encapsulate her in a net now. So think about that because she's basically natural chaos. She's the productivity of natural chaos. And so what mark does is it encapsulates her in the net and that's like a conceptual scheme, right?

Speaker 1:          17:43          He puts, he puts boundaries around the chaos and that's what Margaret can do. That's, that's his ability with his ability to speak in his eyes and his capacity to pay attention. So he, he encloses her, right? And so that's kind of hard on her. She can't get out of the net. And then he cuts her into pieces and then he makes the world out of the pieces. And in fact one of Martin's names is he who fashioned ingenious things out of the carcass of format, which is so cool because it's a tool use metaphor. It's right. How do you conquer nature while you go in there and you, you know, will decompose it in many ways and you make weapons out of it and you make cool things and that keeps it at bay. And how do you do that by speaking and paying attention.

Speaker 1:          18:24          So that's what the Mesopotamians figured out. Now they didn't know that that's what they figured out because like the idea was already there, it was implicit in the dominance hierarchy in some sense, but and they were observing the dominance hierarchy and well, they got their kingdom together. They were bringing tribes in from all over, right? And all the tribes had their stories and then I'll know all those stories had to fight and so that's like the battle of gods in the battle of the gardens and having all those stories had to fight just like Islam and Christianity and Catholicism and protestantism or all scrapping for dominance. Now they're fighting. How do we make sense out of this mess? Maybe take several thousand years, Mesopotamia gathered together all of these tribes and their stories and then the stories fought and out of that fight emerged this story and that was a good enough story. So everyone was happy with it. And the story was. Sorry, I know we have to start. The story was whatever Martin represents, that's top God. And so what did he represent? Vision, attention and speech, and so the Mesopotamians already figured out everything else should be subordinate to vision, attention and speech. It's like good work. Mesopotamians.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Sorry. It's my daughter and she wants to pick me up. Hello? Hi there. Where are you? Okay, but bye. All right, so one final thing. The Mesopotamian emperor emperor was charged with the imitation of Martin. That's what made him sovereign so, so it's not arbitrary. It's like if he was going to be sovereign and he was going to be a good sovereign, that meant he had to be a good Marduk and we'll talk about that when we meet again.
