Speaker 1:          00:00          Turns into Durga if you treat her property, and I didn't use dirt because I wanted to show that I actually got accused by someone being a racist because I did this. It was quite funny because they said, well, you use the into orders to indicate chaos in the Greco Roman goddess to indicate benevolence. And that was obviously an indication of life fundamental pathology. Anyways, it is. I just want them to show that the idea of the benevolent God isn't limited to a single culture. You know, there's Diana, she's got a lot of breasts. That's what's, that's what's down in front there. So she's like the nourishing element of being the best way to think about it and the nourishing element of being emerges in this sort of fashion. So that's the differentiation of the archetype. So way at the back there's the predatory serpent chaos that lurks in the background. And then that fragments. I'll did one more differentiated. So I would in one direction into the feminine and the Feminine. This is a tough one because there's this weird interaction here with, with gender and archetype, you know, so. So here's something to think about,

Speaker 1:          01:13          and I'm, I'm, I'm floundering on this because I have for a long time because it's very difficult. Which gender of person are you most likely to see on the cover of men's magazine? A woman, my gender and most likely to see on the cover of Woman's magazine. Why?

Speaker 2:          01:35          Why is that? Yes, that's right. I think that's why I think that's why.

Speaker 1:          01:48          And that means that they're both possessed by the same archetype in a different way. And the archetype is the architect will feminine fundamentally and for Women The archetypal feminine is a judge and a and an ideal, the judge is, well, how far do you deviate from that? The ideal is to what degree can you emulate? And then from them it's the same damn thing. The judge elements exactly the same thing and the possession element, while it's slightly different, but it's not that different, you know, so, but it's a strange thing because the visual image, general digital images that the feminine. So it's a strange because I don't think the architectural structures were the same men and women. So part of it, the way I've tried to figure this out, it's like the sun is the sun, the like the mail, not the shining sun, although it's also that it's like, but women obviously have an element of them that can be heroic and adversarial, just like man.

Speaker 1:          02:45          But then in women that's complicated because the other primary elements of their Ba is the maternal feminine element. And so. But that's complicated because women or men can also be quite maternal. Like for mammals, predatory mammals, mandarin unbelievably nurturing and feminine. No grizzly bears. We just eat our own problems. Know. So men are, they're quite feminine as well as being masculine. So I kinda think of it this way. It's like if you're thinking about what your archetipal personality structure is, it's for men. The hero is at the forefront and the mother, the feminine modern, restorative behind that. And for women it's reversed. The Feminine Mother is sort of forefront and the heroes behind that. But both of the archetypes are, are, are operative. So, so you can think about that. You can see, see what you make of it.

Speaker 2:          03:36          But

Speaker 1:          03:39          you know, because he might say, well why would women isn't reasonable to presuppose that for women, the feminine represents the unknown just like he does for man. And I don't think it is just like it is for men because I think for women there's an element of the patriarchal structure that's more unknown Mathius for men, you know, and I think you see the reaction to that in part, you see the reaction to that in the feminist movement because the patriarchy is like the tyrannical father, you know, and the patriarchy exists, but it's not the tyrannical father is not the entire substrate of culture. It's just ridiculous. But I think because women are, you know, in some sense they're outsiders to the male dominance hierarchy,

Speaker 2:          04:22          that

Speaker 1:          04:26          the male dominance hierarchy is more contaminated by the unknown for women than it is for math. And I think it's more likely to be interpreted as the tyrannical father because of that. So anyways, I can't exactly sorted out because he ended up with nest problems, you know, so in so far as your primary mode of being as feminine, then your secondary motor being as masculine, you're gonna have all the characteristics of something masculine and all the characteristics of something feminine, but the manner in which they manifest themselves, that's going to be different and I just can't sort that out too damn complicated. Plus I think that that is what we're sorting out right now in our culture. You know, ever since women got the ability to control their reproductive function, which was probably at least in part a consequence of an aide prior psychological transformation, right?

Speaker 1:          05:12          Because you could say, well the pill for women, but then you could say, well what was the precondition for creating a society in which the person who invented the pill didn't get killed. You know, because the Catholic church, for example, was not happy. We build was invented. Seriously, not happy and no wonder know sold. Obviously there had to be some shifting in the underlying conceptual landscape in relationship to the relationship between men and women. For that invention to even have come out, you know, I think you can really see that starting know if you read the classic Russian and all those, you can see that push towards equality to characterize women was really alive and well in 19th century Russia. I'm on mirrors to call aristocracy, so you know like it, it has a pretty lengthy history that's associated a wiping of gender differences across western countries.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Meet the, the, the waning. You mean that widening of personality differences? So big five differences are wider and more here and countries and depression of incidents. I don't know. I don't know how to answer that. Exactly. So the point is that if you look at personality differences between men and women in the modern world, the most egalitarian cultures have the biggest personality differences, the gender, and so the technical reason for that is all the environmental variability has been eliminated and so all that's left is genetic variability and there, and that's not masked in some sense by the environmental variability. So it's powerful and profound, but it definitely shows that there's a lot of powerful genetic variability. Definitely it's powerful evidence for that, you know, but it also could be, it could easily be that didn't necessarily fit what you're aiming for in it. The galitary in society is the right for everyone to be different in their own way, whatever that happens to be, you know, and obviously that's going to be a limited, right to some degree.

Speaker 1:          07:06          So any galitary and society wouldn't necessarily eradicate personality differences. That would be a bloody totalitarian societies. Like get rid of all the differences. Well, to the degree that you're a female and whatever the hell that means fundamentally, and I mail, if we have to be the same, then that's going to be a function of increased tense. What would you call control on the part of the state? You know, to the degree that that's intrinsic, we don't know what, how much of it's intrinsic. I would be very hesitant to say not. I mean let's, let's be real about this

Speaker 3:          07:41          additionally complicated because architects like they're universally, but you understand both the female and the male president. I know you understand and as personality traits, the masculine stereotypical traits and feminine stereotypical traits across genders, but people, any person have you done there can be this as much or whatever, like they're not opposites, so wondering if it's complicated because any individual person that is manifested in parts of both at once in some.

Speaker 1:          08:19          No, it's definitely. It's definitely complicated, but it's also a prerequisite for longterm relationships between men and women. Right. If we weren't a lot the same or at least capable of being the same, then we will be able to understand each other at all. I mean, he didn't. I don't know if we, if we do what we do, we do more than other creatures that have our complexity, that's for sure. So yeah, and you know, it's certainly the case that if you look at a given individual and you look at the variability of their personality, Leighton's behavior, the variability within a person is generally greater than the average variability within the population. So you know, human beings, if you're an extrovert, you can be extremely introverted. Like there's not very many extroverts at a funeral. Now the noisiest people at a funeral will be the extroverts, but there are going to be hard to be noisy at all, you know, and an introvert can find themselves in the situation where they can't shut up.

Speaker 1:          09:15          You know? So there's a lot of inter individual variability. I actually think that one of the indexes of psychological health is the maximizations of individual variability because you should be able to be extremely compassionate, for example, when you're dealing with a sick baby and extremely uncompassionate when you're dealing with someone who's, you know, using their illness as an excuse not to pull their own weight, but you need both of those. Right? And you know, you'll end up with an average point as a consequence of your genetic structure and maybe your, your socialization and sort of up to you to widen yourself all across the full spectrum so that you can call and those abilities when it's necessary. I think that's part of what differentiation as a person actually means. You know, because you, you come to be able to do more things and so you can match yourself much more carefully to the immediate demands of the situation. So yeah, we have the questions.

Speaker 1:          10:16          Okay. So the, the assemble for, for uh, normally the feminine differentiates into the negative feminine, the positive feminine part of the issue is how do you get more of the positive and keep the negative that day. And you know, that's, that's a question that people have to ask themselves at the personal, the individual at that level of the individual interaction with other people and with themselves. But then it also works as a representation of the unknown and nature as such. It's because in some ways those are the same thing. So that's, you know, that's a differentiation. So, so this is the relationship between the hero archetype in the feminist. So what you have here is the chaos dragon differentiating itself into the feminine, which is half positive, half negative, and the feminine. They're being manifested in the form of the Virgin Mary with Christ on her lap. You saw at the same representation when we were looking at Isis and horace, and what's really quite cool about that as you see, she's surrounded by this, this matador law, this, this, uh, you know, almond shaped

Speaker 1:          11:23          opening fundamentally. And you see this as something that renaissance artists get a lot. You see along the edges of the Mandurah, there's all these little baby hits that are popping up with wings on them and those are called Pootie, you know, and it's very common that when you see representations of married with, with, with the cosmos sort of billowing out behind her because that's what you see. It's like a whole into time and space that there's all these potential beings that are surrounding, you know, it's these little baby heads with weight. It's like, what the hell are they? Well, what this thing, you know, it's so strange. I went to a museum in New York where a number of renaissance paintings of this type were, were arrayed in this one room. It's like a rude word, affiliate donors, Nazy Room. And there are people from all over the world and they're looking at these damn paintings.

Speaker 1:          12:09          And they say, you know this, it's like it's married and she's sitting on the moon and there's a bunch of like winged baby heads around like, what the hell's that all about? Everybody's looking at it like, wow, you know, there's really something to this. And it's like you've kept them on the shoulder and you say, well, why did you travel from like Cincinnati to come to this museum to look like this woman who he don't even believe in sitting on the Chris Moon surrounded by baby hands? They don't know. I have no idea why they're there. They're fascinated by the painting. Right? Fascinating. If life interrupts a reasons, but you know, you don't even notice how absurd it is until you take the picture of a bit. What the hell are these things, these Pootie, you know, I think what they are essential beings. That's the representation.

Speaker 1:          12:55          So Mary represents the feminine domain from which potential being emergence, which is perfectly reasonable way of characterizing defendant in architecture. You know what are the pictures I will show you, which I just love is married to another representation of Mary and she's got Christ in her hands and she's holding them up to the left and her foot. Your foot is gone. A snake's head, which I think is so cool because if you look at that picture and you strip away the Judeo Christian presuppositions and you just look at it like a damn biologist, you think, well, of course that's what she's doing. You know? It's like Mama chimp keeps the damn infant away from the snakes and that's the archetype and of course it's the archetype because that is what you do. That's what you do when you're a mother, especially if you have nice edible babies that snakes like to eat and that is certainly something that characterizes us in our evolutionary past.

Speaker 1:          13:47          So it's no wonder it's a divine archetype, you know? Of course it is. How could it not be the. You might say, well, I don't believe in that. It's like the hell. Does that mean you don't believe in that? No, I. I can't even understand what that means anymore. When I think about such things, it's like there's, you don't have an option about bleeding and that it's just the fundamental nature of reality, you know? Is that the mother of God and it's what you mean? It all depends on how much divinity is embodied in your child and believe me, once you have that child, you're going to think, hey, there's a pretty big chunk of divinity and did that child. No one knows. Makes to get that. I'm going to keep it away from predators and you know, evil doers and try to raise it into the best possible things.

Speaker 1:          14:30          Like you may say, you don't believe that. It was like, what the hell do you know in so far as you're a good mother, you'll be acting that I was going mad and I'm not going to say that's wrong because I actually think it's right. I think the child is a container of the divine and that your job as a mother is to allow that child can facilitate the development of that child into the mythological. That's what you're up to and that's a holy mission in so far as you could use that word to describe anything and I failed to see how that is not real. I think it's the most real thing. So when I also think the degree to which you're going to be able to do that as a monitoring will be the most rewarding thing you'll ever do in your life. And you'll figure that out. It's a powerful thing and your whole life can change this completely. Once you have your own child, it's like they're not like other children. They're your old shot. It's like they're the most important thing in the world right then and from then on, if you're healthy, it's like your priorities shift. It's not about you anymore. And that's a sacrifice, you know, it's a real sacrifice. The sacrifice that women are called on for me and itself,

Speaker 1:          15:40          two major sacrifice. Okay? So the, you know, the mother gives birth to the hero. Okay? That's Hercules. It's not priced as Hercules and this particular representation, and she's, I love this representation is. It's so cool. So Hercules', he's out there in the darkness on the water, so it's the water retail, so that's where he's situated themselves voluntarily and he's, is he in this container now? It's a good thing you can take about that as a maternal container or even think about it as cultural protection doesn't really matter. And then he's got this clock and if you look on the cloud, but it's got these weird bumps on it. But if you look at the bottom, what do you understand this? Those aren't farms. Those are our eyes. So He's just like, Marta, he's got this club and what's the club? It's like attention. That's it.

Speaker 1:          16:25          You know what, if you're going to clump something you had to us to pay attention to it. Maybe it's like a rampaging light. And then if you turn away from it, well it's gonna eat you. So the clubs useless without the attention. But you know the picture says club, which is a weapon. A weapon is A. Metta is a form of mental attention, or sorry, I've bought my reverse. Attention is a better weapon. It's the ultimate weapon against the unknown. And so there's, her has got his eyes wide open, he's peering out into the darkness he's got this lion had because he killed a lion and you know, men used to do that, you know, and they were shepherds out in the desert in the Middle East. One of the things they had to do was kill a lion with a spear. It's like,

Speaker 1:          17:11          that's really worth thinking about, man, that's hard to do that. That would be very hard to be very friendly to do that. And so, but men used to do that. So that's really something to think about. Anyways, so he's got this light into going into and he's King of the beasts, roughly speaking. So it represents the thing that's at the top of the dominance hierarchy. You want to know that because otherwise he couldn't have understood the lion king and the lion is a solar beast because it's yellow golden word sounded. You know, what's a daylight creature? It's out there on the belt where everything's son. So it's associated with the Sonnet illumination and enlightenment. And so it's like lions, son Sutton with ice goes to conquer the unknown. That's what the mother does, if she raises the proper son, so I know she's also doing that for the door, but again, that's complicated because women are complicated and their role is very, very complex and so to some degree they're the hero, but to some degree they're the mother of the hero and those are, I would say, I don't know. I don't know how to, how to configure that.

Speaker 1:          18:17          It's you could say,

Speaker 2:          18:24          okay,

Speaker 1:          18:26          you, you could say that in some sense of a conscious mind or gives up her own individual heroism as a sacrifice to the potential hero is a Mumford children's and that's worth thinking about because my guess is that for most of you, your mother did that, you know, now you want to, you know, my wife had a three months about what do you want her great grandmother's shoes. Her grandmother shoots. She really liked her grandmother, a very feminine person, you know, like cookie making, Apple Pie, they shadow play grandmother, you know, she had people in the old folks home even when she was 80 and she was really cheerful and tough, but she's a great person. I really liked her, but when my wife dream diversity driven, she was trying on her shoes and the shoes were too small, you know, and that was very interesting because it seemed to indicate to me, and she loved your grandmother now there's no doubt about that, that role, despite her grandmother having fulfilled us so well it wasn't announced and you know, women have kind of decided that and maybe that's for the best because now there's all these smart women's running around doing useful things and you know, that's probably good, but exactly how to sort that out.

Speaker 1:          19:37          You figure it out.

Speaker 2:          19:38          So what time is it.
