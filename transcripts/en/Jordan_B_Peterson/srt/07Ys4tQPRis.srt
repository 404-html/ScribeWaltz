1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Well,
I took my first degree in political 

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:07,020
science and I was interested in 
motivation for social conflict primarily

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,670
and at the time I took my degree and I 
suppose it's probably similar now,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,420
all the explanations for social conflict
where economic,

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,613
no,
people are basically fighting over 

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,790
resources of one form or another and 
that that just struck me as wrong.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,310
It's too simple.
And,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,960
and it also doesn't explain why people 
value certain resources.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,920
It's not self evident that a resource 
has value.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,100
It depends very much on the cultural 
context and it is also didn't seem to me

11
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,460
to take into account the relationship 
between belief and the individual.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,593
You know,
it was a purely economic explanation of 

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,520
plus then it's also predicated on an 
essentially economic view of man.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,610
It wasn't deep enough to really explain 
the issue.

15
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,050
And,
and at that time too,

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,680
it was in the early eighties when I 
really started to think about this.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,600
It was sort of the second peak of the 
Cold War and,

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,030
and people were very,
very worried about nuclear destruction,

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,110
you know,
it was,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,033
it was a constant background concern.
And so part of what I was curious about 

21
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,894
was wha,
how belief could be important enough so 

22
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,184
that people would be willing to put life
itself at risk to have produced this 

23
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,514
insane standoff with these tens of 
thousands of nuclear weapons and then 

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,343
there was something beyond that too 
because you can explain some of that 

25
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:34,470
with just with territoriality,
but there was more.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,333
There was an element of gratuitous 
violence that characterize situations 

27
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,660
like those in Nazi Germany and also in 
this Dell,

28
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,900
in the camps and in lots of other places
as well.

29
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,734
But those were the two that really stood
out for me that I felt couldn't be 

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,484
explained by law.
Certainly not by a resource theory or 

31
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,970
even really by theory that had anything 
to do with territoriality.

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,803
There was some other element that was 
more metaphysical that wasn't being 

33
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,370
attended to.
He just couldn't account for those sorts

34
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,360
of things.
You know,

35
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,194
it's one thing to kill people.
You could even make a rational account 

36
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,544
for that in under many circumstances,
but to make them as miserable as 

37
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,714
possible while you're killing them.
And then also to do it in a manner 

38
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,360
that's counterproductive with regards to
your own ends,

39
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,910
because that clearly happened in Nazi 
Germany.

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,703
That's not.
There's no straightforward rational 

41
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,320
explanation for that.
So I started reading more and more about

42
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:34,830
that.
There was something about especially the

43
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,664
archetypes of the collective unconscious
and reading that in relationship to the 

44
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,844
Gulag archipelago that I felt that there
was something there that really bore 

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,510
further investigation,
you know,

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,453
and soldier knits and for example,
he concentrated a lot on the 

47
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,544
relationship between individual deceit,
particularly lying to put it simply and 

48
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,850
the pathologies of the state makes a 
very clear case for that.

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
And I'd always sort of interpreted 
Freud's idea of repression as a form of 

50
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,584
lie.
Now I don't think his account of 

51
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,750
repression is,
is correct,

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,620
but it doesn't matter.
It's interestingly wrong at least,

53
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,780
or it's approximately right.
Something like that.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
And then there was a weird connection 
between this idea of the lie as the root

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,163
of pathology in totalitarian states and 
archetipal religious ideas of that were 

56
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,300
associated with the idea of good and 
evil.

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,080
And so that started to attract my 
attention.

58
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,000
I was probably about 20,
it was 1982,

59
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
yeah,
I was 20 and I was also reading 

60
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,660
Nietzsche at that time and I read 
everything that he wrote that the of his

61
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,700
major works.
I mean the whole collected works,

62
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,534
which hadn't been published yet,
but I read them in chronological order 

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,270
and that was extremely interesting for 
me as well.

64
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,253
And there's,
there's a very interesting intellectual 

65
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:05,371
relationship between Nietzsche and young
and Solzhenitsyn in the soldier nets and

66
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,664
connection is more through Dostoevsky,
Dostoevsky a new or a niche and we're 

67
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,763
investigating very,
very similar ideas at exactly the same 

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,943
time.

69
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,053
So there's these weird parallelisms of 
thought and although people don't 

70
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,224
understand,
know what well young was extremely 

71
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,690
influenced by nature just as much as by 
Freud.

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,180
I mean he,
he.

73
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,900
There are,
there is a publication,

74
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,734
for example,
that's notes on his seminar on thus 

75
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,414
spake Sarah Oostra and it's like 2,600
pages long and it only covers the first 

76
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,670
third of the,
of thus spake Zarathustra.

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,890
So the young was very interested in 
nature.

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,040
So these,
I found this source of ideas,

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,113
which I suppose was grounded in some 
sense in 19th century romanticism that 

80
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:54,931
seemed to really get at the root of the 
question as far as I was concerned.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,470
So because there's something,
there's something that isn't just,

82
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,210
it's not just rational behavior that 
drives people towards war.

83
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,650
There's an irrational element of it that
you can't explain without.

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,610
I don't think you can explain it at all 
without recourse to religious language.

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,130
It's the only language that's deep 
enough to get at it properly.

86
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,803
So

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,863
I started reading all this,
like I didn't understand the archetypes 

88
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,824
of the collective unconscious at all.
So I read it again and then I read it 

89
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,660
again and then I,
then I started to understand what,

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,900
what he was talking about a little bit.
You know,

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,970
the,
the idea that these,

92
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,973
that there were patterns of action and 
perception in a sensor or cognitive 

93
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,834
categories.
That's another way of looking at it 

94
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:46,060
that,
that lie at the bottom of our thoughts.

95
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:46,894
They structure the way that we look at 
the world and they have deep 

96
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,580
evolutionary,
a deep evolutionary basis,

97
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,043
and

98
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,970
they have the quality in a sense of.
And that really,

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,830
that really frightened me,
that idea,

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,150
you know,
one thing he said,

101
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,860
which I really love,
he said,

102
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,380
uh,
people don't have ideas,

103
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,110
ideas have people.
I thought,

104
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,944
oh yeah,
that's a really interesting way of 

105
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,270
looking.
It's like Richard Dawkins idea of meme.

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,980
It's funny to read,
darkens,

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,053
darkens is someone who is almost to the 
point where he could read you because 

108
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,390
this idea of memes and the archetypes 
are very,

109
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,224
very close,
except the meme is a trivial concept 

110
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:26,834
compared to the archetype.
So an archetype is like a metal meme in 

111
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,060
a sense.
It's deep.

112
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,090
It's so ancient that it,
it's tangled up in our biology.

113
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,583
So darkens,
even though he's an evolutionary 

114
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,203
thinker,
is still like a post enlightenment 

115
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,954
rationalist.
You actually can't be a post 

116
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,320
enlightenment rationalist at an 
evolutionary thinker.

117
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,030
That doesn't work well.
You're too concerned with rationality.

118
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,660
Rationality is new.
Hardly even matters.

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,490
Some sense.
So anyways,

120
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:08,491
so I was obsessed with the,
with the idea of destruction.

121
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,874
And the will to destroy fundamentally 
and its expression and totalitarianism 

122
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,370
and then its relationship with the 
history of ideas in general.

123
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,204
That's partly why found niches so useful
because Nietzsche predicted that the 

124
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,570
20th century would be award in some 
sense between while certainly a war that

125
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:29,834
was,

126
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,470
that would involve communist ideas.
He,

127
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,510
he predicted that about 18,
60,

128
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:38,790
something like that in will to power.
He said,

129
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,733
you know,
we'll pay for that conflict with a 

130
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
couple of tens of millions of lives,
which is quite the prognostication like 

131
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,980
30 years before the fact.
And then you also talked about nihilism

132
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,580
and both of those as a reaction to the 
collapse of Christianity.

133
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,000
And that struck me as highly plausible.
So,

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,980
so nature was also extremely useful.
See,

135
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
one of the things about young is that 
young spend his whole career trying to 

136
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,223
answer niches question.
So Nietzsche said basically that the 

137
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,170
conflict between enlightenment thinking 
and religious thinking,

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,890
Christian thinking in particular was 
going to wipe Christian thinking out,

139
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,783
or at least people's ability to believe 
in the metaphysical assumptions that 

140
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,934
underlied Christianity and that the only
proper response to that would be 

141
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,260
nihilism.
Which he was very much concerned with or

142
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,393
authoritarianism,
and so Nisha was trying to develop a 

143
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,624
philosophy of what might constitute a 
third path and that's expressed to some 

144
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,404
degree in thus spake Sarah booster with 
the idea of the superman or the 

145
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,160
overmanned.
But

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,470
that idea really never got developed.
In fact,

147
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,304
you believe that the development of that
idea was part of what drove Nietzsche 

148
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,830
insane.
He,

149
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,260
he thought that he developed a kind of 
schizophrenia.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,153
Inflation,
believe that inflation was the invasion 

151
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,010
of the conscious ego with archetipal 
content.

152
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,240
And so it's almost like when the old 
hero dies,

153
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,403
a new hero is born and that new hero in 
some sense was born within niches 

154
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:27,894
consciousness.
But those are experiences that are 

155
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,130
powerful enough in some sense to have a 
psychotic element to them.

156
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,503
And anyways,
Nisha died before he developed those 

157
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,724
ideas very far,
but then young spent his entire career 

158
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,150
in some sense trying to understand here 
on mythology,

159
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,984
fundamentally

160
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,973
through a lot of people who insist that 
religion or otherwise supernatural 

161
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,710
belief systems are mythologies,
are relics from the past.

162
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,510
Um,
you know,

163
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,493
from another era.
And they're either naive faulty 

164
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:58,834
descriptions of actual material reality 
the same way that we think of science 

165
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,150
today,
or they're.

166
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:08,520
They were kind of a,
a crowd control tools,

167
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,930
Straw man arguments.
Fundamentally.

168
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,490
I mean,
one of them is just Marxist,

169
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,723
you know,
it's like water power structures there 

170
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,620
for while they're there to serve the 
purposes of the elite.

171
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,580
It's like,
no,

172
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,750
that's one of their purposes.
That mono mania,

173
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,603
that,
that,

174
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,190
that insane desire for singular causes.
To me,

175
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,020
that's also the expression of an 
archetype.

176
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,690
It's monotheism inaction.
It's like,

177
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,580
you know,
so you see these people who,

178
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,520
who,
who claim to be atheistic,

179
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,880
they just invented new God.
Fuko did that with power for.

180
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,520
I did that with sex.
You know if you're smart too,

181
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:47,300
you can take a major motivational drive 
or system.

182
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:50,180
They're not really drives.
They're really personalities.

183
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,103
You can take a major motivational 
personality like power sex and you can 

184
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:58,100
explain everything on its basis because 
everything is.

185
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,480
Every human action is motivated by the 
major motivational systems,

186
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,670
some ad mixture of them.

187
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,773
And then if you're smart enough,
you can always figure out a way that 

188
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:11,960
some complex phenomena is related 
causely to some simpler motivation.

189
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:14,810
But it's intellectual masturbation as 
far as I'm concerned.

190
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:17,360
It's not the attempt to explain 
something,

191
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,194
it's the attempt to reduce everything to
one simple principle that you can be 

192
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,950
master of now.
So that.

193
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,130
So you know,
was religion for crowd control?

194
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,750
Well it's just a,
that's an empty theory.

195
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,110
Well what,
so this is what a multigenerational,

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,540
a conspiracy.
That's what it is.

197
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,374
It's,
it's a conspiracy that stretches as far 

198
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:45,110
back into the past as we could imagine.
Right back to where people were tribal.

199
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,930
And maybe farther back than that.
I mean,

200
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,540
that's not an explanation.
And the,

201
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,060
the other one,
the a supernatural.

202
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,670
Well you know,
there are,

203
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,163
there are,
there are people who think they think 

204
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,360
scientifically but they don't because 
they're not very good at it.

205
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,300
And then there are people who think 
scientifically at a genius level,

206
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,201
it's like,
well,

207
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,110
there are people who think they think 
religiously but don't.

208
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,944
And then there are people who think 
religiously at a genius level and you 

209
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:19,411
can't assume that you can use the same 
motivational explanation at every single

210
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:23,200
level of analysis.
So yes,

211
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,900
there are elements of religious belief 
that are superstitious,

212
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:26,990
although,
you know,

213
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:27,824
that's,
that's kind of a slight of hand too 

214
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:33,820
because if you want to argue that 
religious religion is only superstition,

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,833
you collect up all the superstitions,
you define them as religious and then 

216
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,630
you define religion as a collection of 
superstitions.

217
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,780
So you know,
it's,

218
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:42,614
it's not very careful articulation of 
the whole class of phenomena that are 

219
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,950
attempting to be that,
that,

220
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,180
that,
that people are attempting to explain.

221
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
And there's also a big difference 
between explaining and explaining away.

222
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,730
So.
Well Dennis likes to explain away things

223
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,950
like consciousness,
you know,

224
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,430
and you can't explain away consciousness
while you can.

225
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,660
It depends on how you structure your 
initial presumptions about the world,

226
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,113
you know,
so the logos that we were talking about 

227
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,060
earlier that's associated with let's 
say,

228
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,840
articulated truth and the communication 
of articulated truth,

229
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,830
that's basically the prime function of 
consciousness.

230
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,933
And the,
the Judeo Christian story is predicated 

231
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:32,680
on the idea that that is a fundamental 
element of being.

232
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,923
Now you can,
you can structure your world with 

233
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,530
different presuppositions.
So you could say,

234
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,690
well,
consciousness is an EPA phenomena of the

235
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,640
material world.
Well,

236
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,743
you can make a perfectly coherent and 
useful set of tools out of those 

237
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:48,664
presuppositions,
but that set of tools does not cover 

238
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,264
everything that you need and it's no 
more viable as an explanation than the 

239
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,430
explanation that no consciousness is 
somehow fundamental to being.

240
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,320
And of course being is different than 
material reality.

241
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,753
So,
and these things aren't grappled with 

242
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,724
properly by positivistic scientists who 
have no real training in philosophy and 

243
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,810
who knew nothing at all about religion.
You know,

244
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,310
their religion,
the Christianity that Darkens,

245
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:26,720
criticizes is the Christianity that a 
smart 13 year old boy objects too.

246
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,550
So it's like,
well,

247
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,610
how can you reconcile genesis with 
evolutionary history?

248
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,511
It's like,
well no,

249
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:36,860
that's really not the problem.
So it's a straw man argument.

250
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,353
Hello,
ugly.

251
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,640
You better sit.
Sit,

252
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,190
lay down,
lay down.

253
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,423
One of the things that I've learned 
about argumentation is that if you're 

254
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:52,100
trying to distinguish between the 
validity of two

255
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,933
different worldviews,
you want to make the strongest possible 

256
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:02,060
case for both worldviews.
You're not trying to be right.

257
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,643
You're trying to figure something out 
and the easiest way to be right is to 

258
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:06,854
make your opponent into an idiot,
so there is no doubt that empirical 

259
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:18,300
science has kicked the slats out of the 
way.

260
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:19,134
People think about religion because it 
wasn't easy for people to understand 

261
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,424
that there could be different,
that different systems of thought might 

262
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,164
have different purposes.
You have to be a philosopher of thought 

263
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,040
to think about that even,
and I don't think it was.

264
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,130
I don't think that became obvious at all
until after Nisha

265
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,753
not all

266
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,840
belief system served the same masters so
to speak,

267
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,333
and so

268
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,000
you can't assume that every system of 
thought is doing the same thing

269
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,013
and then

270
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,673
you can't assume also that there's only 
one way to formulate your basic 

271
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,350
assumptions about the nature of reality.
I mean,

272
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,184
heidegger,
I didn't discover the relationship 

273
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:14,824
between the system of thought that I 
derived say for a mutual and young and 

274
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,803
some other people that are,
I read and heidegger until much after I 

275
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:24,484
had written maps of meaning,
but heidegger's study of being is 

276
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:29,944
predicated on the idea that being is the
fundamental reality and that is not 

277
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,260
objective reality.
It's not material reality.

278
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,240
It's lived experience.
Something like that.

279
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,540
Lived experience is real.
Okay,

280
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,930
that's a presupposition.
So you start with that presupposition.

281
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:44,890
Then you ask yourself,
well,

282
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:47,020
what are the basic elements of lived 
reality?

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,453
And then what happens there?
Or at least what seems to have happened 

284
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:51,544
is that high heidegger identified the 
same basic elements of lived reality 

285
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,600
that I identified in maps of meaning and
one was

286
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,950
the social world.
The world is constructed by humans,

287
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,873
which I think is basically the,
an elaborate a dominance hierarchy and 

288
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,494
it's permanent.
So this is where the issue about what 

289
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,270
constitutes reality becomes very 
critical.

290
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,330
Dominance hierarchies are 300 million 
years old.

291
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,793
They're older than trees.
So if you think that's what one 

292
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,300
definition of what's real is what's 
persistent across time,

293
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,943
then it's almost impossible to find 
anything more real about life than a 

294
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,540
dominance hierarchy.
So to your point about lobsters,

295
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,220
I think absolutely,
absolutely.

296
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,040
It's the same bloody circuitry,
serotonergic circuitry.

297
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:40,874
I mean there's another circuit that 
lobsters used that we don't have that's 

298
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,610
based on Oct octa mean I think that's 
the right word,

299
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,713
but a lot of the way that maneuver 
within dominance hierarchies is the way 

300
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,350
we maneuver within dominance 
hierarchies.

301
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,383
If you're an evolutionary thinker,
you can't just push that away and 

302
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,793
dominance hierarchies are,
although you can think about them as a 

303
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:06,060
social construct there also for a 
natural phenomena.

304
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,660
Right?
So the dominance hierarchy is actually a

305
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,510
major part of the environment to which 
we have adapted.

306
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,420
Okay.
So there's the dominance hierarchy,

307
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,254
that's the,
we'll say the social world for the sake 

308
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:18,444
of argument.
There's the natural world and there's 

309
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,593
the experiencing subject.
While those are high degrees categories 

310
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,911
of being as well and in in some sense 
what what religious thinking seems to do

311
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,214
is to continually pause it.
Those three things as interacting 

312
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:40,431
causally at the base of being so,
and that's not a material reality.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,793
There's a lot of things about being that
we can't attribute simply to material 

314
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,220
reality.
We may eventually be able to do that,

315
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,054
but by that time our notion of what 
constitutes material will be much 

316
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,560
different.
Okay,

317
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:56,394
so we.
We can't deal with subjectivity within 

318
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,810
the confines of our materialists 
theories,

319
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,733
not.
It's partly because those theories are 

320
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:08,031
predicated on the elimination of 
subjectivity as an aide priority move,

321
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,150
right?

322
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,450
The whole point of objective science is 
to remove subjectivity.

323
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,480
Okay,
so then it gets removed and while you're

324
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,040
surprised about it,
it's like,

325
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,431
well,
no,

326
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,010
you can't be surprised about it.
You remove it right at the beginning.

327
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,180
Now that works for certain purposes.
It works very well,

328
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,840
but it has consequences and some of 
those consequences,

329
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:28,674
as far as I'm concerned,
are serious enough to produce two forms 

330
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:34,404
of social and mental illness and one of 
those would be the succumbing to the 

331
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:41,424
temptations of authoritarianism and the 
other would be succumbing to the 

332
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,354
temptations of nihilism because they're.
They're logical consequences of the of 

333
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,910
the definition of subjective is no 
unreal.

334
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,640
So now then you ask yourself,
well,

335
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,610
how do you determine whether or not a 
theory is true?

336
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,370
Then you ask yourself,
well,

337
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,110
what do you mean by true?
Well,

338
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,120
then you're in trouble.
Okay,

339
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,954
because I think you can take a Newtonian
perspective on that or a Darwinian 

340
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,410
perspective,
but you can't do both at the same time.

341
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,960
Yeah,
so nature said truth serves life.

342
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,990
Okay?
In some sense that's a Darwinian idea.

343
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,210
Okay.
If it's true enough so that if you acted

344
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,083
out or hold it,
that increases your chances of survival 

345
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:35,310
and reproduction over long spans of 
time.

346
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,340
That's true.
Okay.

347
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,223
We have no idea if our detailed 
knowledge about the material world is 

348
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:43,884
going to be the type of knowledge that 
allows us to survive and reproduce over 

349
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:47,694
a long period of time.
It's not been tested from a Darwinian 

350
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,030
perspective at all and you might say,
well,

351
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,570
of course the materialist perspective is
right.

352
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,960
Look what we've built with it.
We've built hydrogen bombs,

353
00:20:58,961 --> 00:20:59,794
for example,
but then you might object to that by 

354
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,501
saying,
well,

355
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,334
yeah,

356
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,593
we've built hydrogen bombs,
but the only reason we could build the 

357
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:12,470
more we're willing to was because we 
left things out of the equation,

358
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,810
but what things.
Well,

359
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,423
things like,
is it really a good idea to build 

360
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,790
hydrogen bombs?
For example.

361
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,290
I can give you another example of that.
Um,

362
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,330
I read a book a while back that was 
written by a kgb officer who claim to be

363
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:33,410
exposing the inner workings of the 
Soviet scientific community with regards

364
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,244
to a biologic warfare.
And the people in the institute that he 

365
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:43,880
described,
we're trying to cross ebola was smallpox

366
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,160
because smallpox is extremely infectious
and Ebola is extremely deadly.

367
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,270
So like that's a valid scientific 
enterprise.

368
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,070
Okay.
Then you think,

369
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,933
oh,
isn't that interesting that that's a 

370
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:02,010
valid scientific enterprise because 
obviously that's insane.

371
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,780
So then you think,
well,

372
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,440
if it's so obvious that that's insane 
and it's a valid scientific enterprise,

373
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,603
well

374
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,933
there's some disconnect there between 
two different views of what constitute 

375
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:14,954
at least appropriate behavior.
Now you know that this is why the 

376
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:20,870
definitions of truth start to become so 
important.

377
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,910
It's like is truth as expressed to 
action,

378
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,630
is it truth as it serves Darwinian 
purposes?

379
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,730
Is it truth as defined by the axioms of 
material of a materialist philosophy,

380
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,653
which by the way aren't even true 
anymore because if you go down far 

381
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:36,434
enough into material reality,
now we know you hit a realm that's so 

382
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:43,360
bizarre that we can't even comprehend it
and it which has ended.

383
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,550
There's implications of that bizarreness
that we can't comprehend.

384
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,863
So I would say we will develop a 
materialist philosophy of consciousness 

385
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:51,674
eventually,
but it won't be using the same material 

386
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,540
that we use now.
Right?

387
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,923
So,

388
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,380
so if I understand correctly,
you're talking about there's the,

389
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,883
let's say the industrialized north in a.
In a society that relies on scientific 

390
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:11,384
analysis to to make it make it,
to establish the fundamental bases on 

391
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:20,150
which does the rest of the society is 
predicated.

392
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,670
Yeah.
There are certain assumptions about what

393
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,480
is real versus what is not real.
What is what is actually out there.

394
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,250
If there's a distinction between 
subjects,

395
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,083
but even there,
there's an implicit assumption that's 

396
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:37,360
what's out there in objective space is 
what's real.

397
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,411
Okay,
well,

398
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:42,940
but the problem with that is that that's
an assumption about reality.

399
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,650
Now it's obviously a powerful 
assumption,

400
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,930
but here's another way of looking at the
Darwinian problem as far as I can tell.

401
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:51,764
So part of the reason that the 
Darwinians insist that random mutation 

402
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,740
is the source of

403
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,560
continual,
it's not progress.

404
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,483
Continual survival is that the 
underlying environment changes and it 

405
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:13,350
changes unpredictably by,
by,

406
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,080
by its essential nature,
it's unpredictable.

407
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,090
Thus,
if it's unpredictable,

408
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,420
only random transformation can keep up 
with it.

409
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,493
A lot of random transformation.
Hopefully the randomness of the 

410
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:30,900
environmental change will be matched by 
the randomness of the genetic change.

411
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,243
Okay?
So what that means in part is that the 

412
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,710
environment,
so to speak,

413
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,770
is finally incomprehensible because you 
can't predict it.

414
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,383
Okay?
So that means that a limited creature 

415
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:51,321
that's established itself by Darwinian 
means can't have access to the truth.

416
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,453
They can only have access to sufficient 
truth and sufficient truth is the truth 

417
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,770
that allows you to survive and 
reproduce,

418
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,760
and from a Darwinian perspective,
there isn't any truth past that.

419
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,553
So I don't think Dawkins is a Darwinian.
I think he's a Newtonian because he 

420
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:09,804
believes that there is truth.
The Darwinians don't believe that the 

421
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,404
Darwinians say no,
there's enough truth to keep you alive 

422
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:21,000
and have you survive,
and that's all.

423
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,280
And eventually all that's going to go 
to.

424
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:26,400
Because you know,
99 point five percent of all species are

425
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,070
extinct.
That's an amazing point.

426
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,023
If I understand it correctly,
the American pragmatists figured this 

427
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:33,450
out at the late 18 hundreds.

428
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,390
Exactly.
That this reminds me of pregnant.

429
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,310
His philosophy specifically,
which I have a soft spot for.

430
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,453
It speaks to me directly,
but I'm thinking about other people who 

431
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:44,530
will do I know what the university or 
just in my life if they hear this,

432
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:45,364
they would just say what like.
So it's as if we're living in two 

433
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,050
different worlds.
At the same time,

434
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,760
we are in the sense that we.
We've internalized the,

435
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,510
the evolutionary mindset for a large 
part and parcel of,

436
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,080
of how we understand reality,
but at the same time we pulled onto this

437
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:06,640
notion of truth as beyond our subjective
experience out there,

438
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,540
and we're actually directly when we 
conduct these experiments.

439
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,720
This is just true,
right?

440
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,970
Well,
it's all part of the problem too,

441
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,950
is that because,
because,

442
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,080
um,
sciences,

443
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,920
reductionistic,
whenever you measure something extremely

444
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:21,754
accurately,
there's a whole bunch of other things 

445
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:23,864
that you're not measuring.
And your assumption is that the 

446
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:27,244
knowledge gained by that precision isn't
undone by the dismissal of everything 

447
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:35,890
else.
Well,

448
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,383
is that a valid claim?
It depends on what your preconditions 

449
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:50,490
are for determining validity.
Like automobiles,

450
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,070
automobiles,
get you from point a to point b,

451
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,181
you might say,
well,

452
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,180
that's their fundamental purpose.
That's what they were designed to do.

453
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,501
But I could say,
well,

454
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,334
no,
it turns out that their fundamental 

455
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,300
consequence,
if not purpose,

456
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:05,820
is the complete transformation of 
cities,

457
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,350
the demolition of the rural communities 
and the destruction of that noosphere.

458
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,760
It's like,
oh,

459
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:14,340
we left something out.
Yeah,

460
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,940
you left something out.
So you gain,

461
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,933
you gain precision,
but you pay for it with a loss of 

462
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:29,270
something else.
And then there's the other problem,

463
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:34,220
which is the pragmatic problem,
which is truth for what

464
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,673
you know,
it's difficult for me to say see that 

465
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,413
it's dangerous as far as I'm concerned 
to considered truth independent of its 

466
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,400
effect on us.
So I think if a truth drives you insane,

467
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,153
it's not a truth.
There's something wrong with it and 

468
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,140
that's like a definition,
but,

469
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,610
but I think it's a definition that's 
grounded in Darwinian thinking.

470
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,090
And I think what I think about religion 
is a very dark Darwinian.

471
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,893
I think religion is an evolved.
It's evolved knowledge and it's 

472
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:25,560
knowledge about action and the world is 
made out of action.

473
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:29,580
So especially the human world.
So you can't say,

474
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:32,370
well that's not real.
It's like that's wrong.

475
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,850
It's real.
It's not something you can easily reduce

476
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,170
to causal relationships between the 
fundamental building blocks of matter.

477
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,460
But not only is it real,
everyone acts like it's real.

478
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,320
And then I would say,
well,

479
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,420
I don't care what people say about what 
they think about,

480
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:49,254
what's real.
I care about how they act because that 

481
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:52,884
actually shows what they really believe,
so and whatever their rational mind is 

482
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,020
computing and,
and you know,

483
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,270
chattering about on the surface,
it's like,

484
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,690
who cares about that?
They're just possessed by ideas.

485
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,251
You know,
they may,

486
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,290
they might be defenders of the ideas 
too,

487
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,690
but that doesn't mean they believe them,
you know,

488
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,180
depending on how you define belief.
Right.

489
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,010
Okay.
So this is,

490
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,843
this is getting to the crux of it.
I think it will be good luck with the 

491
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:22,670
rest of the discussion.
So we're talking here about truth,

492
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,743
not a reinterpretation of truth from an 
objectivist positivist scientific 

493
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:29,024
perspective,
which we've inherited from the 

494
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,920
rationalist area.
You're saying,

495
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,680
what's a return to the original 
conceptions of truth,

496
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,514
right?
Along with the American pragmatists and 

497
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
in light of a Darwinian insight into 
what life is the about the pragmatists.

498
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,083
Like I said,
as soon as Darwin published the origin 

499
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:45,874
of species,
they recognize that the theory of 

500
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,600
evolution was pragmatic.
They got it.

501
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,940
Like right now,
they were very excited about it.

502
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,313
So.
And they got excited about it because 

503
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,460
the Darwinian claim is things are always
true enough and that's it.

504
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,760
And it isn't in some sense even because 
you lack knowledge,

505
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,390
it's because you couldn't have the 
knowledge,

506
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,793
even hypothetically without running a 
simulation as complicated as the world 

507
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:13,924
itself.
And even then it wouldn't turn out the 

508
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:16,774
same way.

509
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,050
Deleon view of reality in the sense 
that,

510
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,920
you know,
any,

511
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,440
any explanation of the complexity of the
system is,

512
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,590
is doomed to be simpler than the system.
Yeah.

513
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,360
Yes.
That's one way of thinking about it.

514
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,194
Sure,
sure.

515
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,750
Well,
you,

516
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,480
you could think about it as.
That's right.

517
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,840
You can think about it as a limitation 
of the perceiver.

518
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,933
The problem too is that whatever 
knowledge you crew about the system 

519
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,473
changes the system.
It's like trying to predict the stock 

520
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,680
market,
which isn't possible.

521
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,113
Right?
So I think that's a really good example 

522
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:51,570
actually.
And you know,

523
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,790
tried to predict the stock market 
rationally.

524
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,760
See how you do what you might say,
well it's not real.

525
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:57,594
It's like,
okay,

526
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,793
well we don't agree about what 
constitutes real so we can have that 

527
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:02,664
discussion.

528
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,440
It sounds like what you're saying is 
that truth is as much about action as it

529
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:16,310
is about some sort of material,
measurable objectives.

530
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,510
No,
I'm saying it's more about action more.

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,351
Oh yes,
yes.

532
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:25,351
The fundamentals of truth are,
are those that guide action and then the

533
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,750
objective science is nested inside that 
it has to be.

534
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,130
There's no way around that.

535
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,990
Okay.
So that,

536
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,850
that,
that I think is a really central because

537
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:33,684
everything in my mind,
everything in maps of meaning and a lot 

538
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:39,360
of your other work flows from there.
It's a different way.

539
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

540
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,310
Priority.
That's right.

541
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,210
That's right.

542
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,240
Maybe we can elaborate that a bit.

543
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,871
Okay.
Well,

544
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:44,641
let.
We could do that.

545
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,474
Darwinian.
Let's do it from a Darwinian 

546
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:48,150
perspective.
Okay.

547
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,373
So first of all,
there's the single celled animals will 

548
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:54,690
say,
well,

549
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,180
we don't have to talk about them.
What,

550
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,210
what we're going to start to talk about 
is animals that have a complex,

551
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,493
a sufficiently complex nervous system to
have to respond to the social 

552
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:08,970
environment which would be made out of 
conspecifics often.

553
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,660
So lobsters are a perfectly good place 
to start.

554
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,370
It's like once lobster,
lobster,

555
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:20,310
and then there's another lobster and 
maybe they're alone.

556
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,030
Well then they only have to solve the 
problem of being one lobster,

557
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,310
but then as soon as you put them 
together,

558
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,640
they have to solve the problem of being 
too lobsters in the same space,

559
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,370
and then maybe there's 100 lobsters in 
the same space,

560
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:33,204
so then the question becomes how do you 
organize lobster behavior when most of 

561
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:41,930
the environment consists of other 
lobsters behaving and the answer to that

562
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,240
as being you put it,
you make a dominance hierarchy,

563
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,733
and then the dominance hierarchy,
the way you adapt to the dominance 

564
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:52,214
hierarchy is by noting the patterns of 
behavior that compose it and by first 

565
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,033
internalizing those,
let's say modeling them to the degree 

566
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,574
that that's possible,
but even more remarkably over huge 

567
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,884
expanses of time because of the 
dominance hierarchy and it's patterns 

568
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,140
are a fundamental element of reality.

569
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,800
You start to adapt biologically to the 
dominance hierarchy,

570
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,143
so okay,
so now what we've got is we've got an 

571
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,270
emergent set of of social behaviors,
okay?

572
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:30,050
They're not rules because they're not 
real until you observe them or until you

573
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,260
codify them or til you would articulate 
them.

574
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,480
What they are is the patterns from which
rules emerge and they're deep patterns,

575
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,780
so then you might say,
okay,

576
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,200
what are the rules for staying alive in 
a dominance hierarchy,

577
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,700
not being torn apart by your 
conspecifics and that's learning quickly

578
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:52,820
who can tear you into pieces and who 
can't,

579
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,013
and learning how to get away from the 
thing that can tear you into pieces 

580
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,194
quickly and learning how to push the 
thing that can't aside and you'd better 

581
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,274
learn that fast and you want to learn it
with the minimum possible amount of 

582
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:08,300
damage because that's another problem 
that social creatures have,

583
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,220
or at least creatures that are in a 
dominant Turkey.

584
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,820
It gets even more complicated when the 
members of the dominance hierarchy start

585
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,850
to cooperate.
But lobsters,

586
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,780
as far as we know,
as far as I know,

587
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:21,740
don't cooperate so but still like their 
behavior is very,

588
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:25,850
very determined by the nature of the 
dominance hierarchy.

589
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,440
Okay,
so what that is,

590
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,663
the patterns that govern a dominance 
hierarchy are the place from which 

591
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,973
ethics derive right,
and they evolved there and they're not 

592
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,400
arbitrary.
That's the other thing.

593
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,520
What works in one dominance hierarchy 
works in another.

594
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,980
And so you might say,
well what's your proof for that?

595
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,540
And why would say,
well,

596
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:52,541
one of my approvers for that is that we 
use the same brain chemical and the same

597
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,453
neurological system roughly speaking,
to keep track of our position in the 

598
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:04,160
dominance hierarchy as lobsters do and 
that's 300 million years of continuity.

599
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,233
So.
So that's real enough as far as I'm 

600
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:10,454
concerned.

601
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,150
So okay,
so now you've got your lobsters and find

602
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:14,984
that they organize themselves according 
to these rules and the top lobster is 

603
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,420
confident and makes himself big and he's
the one that gets all the chicks.

604
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,643
So.
So your success in the dominance 

605
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,194
hierarchy,
especially if you're male also 

606
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:29,684
determines the probability of your 
reproduction and it may determine that 

607
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:33,674
more than anything else.
So how to maneuver in the dominance 

608
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:37,604
hierarchy,
be the prime question that faces 

609
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,204
creatures that have to live with 
conspecifics and the females in some 

610
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:46,974
sense use the dominance hierarchy as a 
distributed computational device to 

611
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:52,314
determine the worth of the males.
So because what the females do is they 

612
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,620
sort of hang off to the side and they 
watched the males battle it out and then

613
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,454
they just pick from the top.
Now they have their own hierarchy and 

614
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,500
you know,
it runs by somewhat different rules,

615
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:05,790
but it's very smart.

616
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,623
He'd say it's,
they're externalizing the cognitive 

617
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:12,330
problem to the structure itself.
So okay,

618
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,193
so,
so then there's the rules that govern 

619
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:16,710
the dominant Turkey,
the simple one,

620
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:19,080
which is just where they're the same 
animals,

621
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,914
but they're competing.
But then when you get a little farther 

622
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:22,950
along,
you know,

623
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:27,540
maybe to the point where animals are 
hunting together,

624
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,850
that might be it or,
or caretaking,

625
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:30,960
something like that.
Anyways,

626
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:32,700
we're cooperative.
Behavior emerges.

627
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,803
Okay.
Now,

628
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,460
different rules start to apply because 
like in a wolf pack,

629
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:42,000
let's say the wall still wants to get to
the top,

630
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,823
but he doesn't want to tear everyone two
pieces as he climbs to the top because 

631
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,960
if he did that,
then he won't be in a pack and then that

632
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,020
that's not going to work.
He's going to starve to death.

633
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:57,021
So that really gets complicated.
It's like you can defeat someone but you

634
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,570
can't destroy them.
Okay,

635
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:02,404
there's another more rule.
You can defeat someone but you can't 

636
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:06,790
destroy them.
So you might say,

637
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,000
well,
that's a rule that emerges spontaneously

638
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,020
as a consequence of social interactions 
under biological control.

639
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,003
And once the rule emerges,
the dominance hierarchy lasts long 

640
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,294
enough.
So evolutionary pressure can start to 

641
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:23,454
operate to ensure that creatures within 
that system build their ability to 

642
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,114
follow that rule into their nervous 
systems because it's the main selection 

643
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
force,
whether they're successful at it.

644
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,110
So what seems to be arbitrary and social
can become built in and biological,

645
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,494
I think faster than we understand,
because the consequences of being 

646
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,620
victorious in the dominance hierarchy 
are so high.

647
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,220
So in the wolf hierarchy,
it's sort of like

648
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,420
we got hunt together,
we're going to have disputes about who's

649
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:01,780
boss will settle the dispute 
symbolically,

650
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,800
fundamentally,
right.

651
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:04,300
All threaten you.
You threatened me.

652
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,070
One of us will blink,
the guide that blinks,

653
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:08,320
rolls over,
throw shows his throat.

654
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,630
You pretend to rip it out,
but you don't.

655
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,470
And we accept that as a proxy for 
battle.

656
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,400
And so you're making the case that will 
operate symbolically.

657
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,420
No,
not at all.

658
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:22,150
It's just that it's coded in their 
behavior.

659
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

660
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,000
You have to make a real distinction 
between patterns of action and rules.

661
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,450
They're not the same thing because we 
like to think that,

662
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,763
well,
if you see regularities in an animal's 

663
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:35,980
behavior,
it's rules.

664
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,300
No,
it's as if it's following rules and from

665
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,680
more anthropomorphizing assumption,
but it's also a different.

666
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,710
It's also a different.
It's a level of abstraction above.

667
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,140
First,
it's the pattern of behavior.

668
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,213
Then if you observe the pattern of 
behavior and you have the capacity to 

669
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,084
make symbolic representations,
then you can make the symbolic 

670
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,490
representation and those would emerge 
first in image,

671
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:02,140
not in words,
image,

672
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,960
image in stories.
Right?

673
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,943
So that's like the dramatic sub behavior
and then it's behavior imitating 

674
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,840
behavior.
That's drama,

675
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,060
that's like a Piagetian idea,
you know,

676
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,880
that you can use your body as a 
representational structure.

677
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,760
That's what human beings can do.
That's what imitation is.

678
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,670
It's a big deal.
So,

679
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,623
okay,
so you've got the wolves and it's sort 

680
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:26,020
of like,
this is great so far,

681
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:30,840
but it sounds like the argument is 
building from lobsters to um,

682
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,480
and this is how I'm interpreting from 
lobsters to a strong argument for

683
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,230
essentially why Union archetypes 
actually.

684
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,000
Absolutely,
yes.

685
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,070
Well this is very important.
This is.

686
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,693
But I think what's also important is to 
help you help viewers understand how we 

687
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:53,350
get from lobsters and dominance 
hierarchies to no problem.

688
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,221
Truth.
Okay.

689
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:59,221
So they're not things they're 
constituent elements of ray of reality.

690
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,030
That's not the same thing.
Okay.

691
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:01,864
And,
and a constituent element of reality is 

692
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:08,150
in some sense depends on the thing,
but it's,

693
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,070
it's longevity is sufficient to make it 
more than merely a thing.

694
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,380
Things are kind of temporary.
I mean,

695
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:16,300
protons aren't,
but you know,

696
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,850
things are temporary dominance 
hierarchies,

697
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:21,550
those are not temporary.
Those are eternal.

698
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,370
They're eternal as far as we're 
concerned,

699
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,683
you know?
Okay,

700
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,480
so you got the wolf and then you think,
well,

701
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,314
what kind of wolf gets to the top and 
you might think the toughest wolf that 

702
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,530
sort of like the caveman theory,
you know,

703
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,760
but it's unlikely that it's the toughest
wolf.

704
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,770
It's a wolf that's well adapted across 
multiple dimensions,

705
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,933
but this,
the wolf that successful in the 

706
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:52,981
dominance hierarchy you could think of 
as the archetipal wolf right now.

707
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,270
What kind of Wolf is that?
Well,

708
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:57,160
I don't know enough about wolves to 
know,

709
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:57,994
but I do know some things about dogs 
mean a dog is cooperative as well as 

710
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:03,814
competitive and it's,
it's pretty sophisticated at picking up 

711
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,850
the cues that indicate the nature of 
social relationships.

712
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:13,090
Like it can do that in human society.
The dog doesn't know the rules,

713
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,860
but the dog has the morality of a 
dominant system already built into it.

714
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,960
So it's,
it's a predicate of its,

715
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,480
of its biological existence.
Okay.

716
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:27,040
So we'll switch to chimps because you 
can actually talk a little bit more.

717
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,363
So with a little bit more concrete 
knowledge about which chimps when says 

718
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:33,264
lot from de wall,
which chimp stays on top because 

719
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,280
mailchimp's make a pretty vicious 
hierarchy,

720
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:42,260
right?
And it's almost always a male on top.

721
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,850
It's not so clear with Bonobos,
but Benobos,

722
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,600
I never know how to say that,
but.

723
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,090
But the chimp that stays on top,
brutal chimps can rule for a while,

724
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,463
but because they're brutal,
they're not very good at making 

725
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:56,774
coalitions and even if your brutal and 
strong to guys that are half as brutal 

726
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:01,454
as you and three quarters is strong,
we'll take you down and that's what the 

727
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,020
chimps do.
So then you might say,

728
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:06,854
well,
in order to be optimally situated for 

729
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:11,324
maximum reach reproductive potential,
not only do you want to climb the 

730
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,224
hierarchy,
you want to climb it without being hurt 

731
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,340
too much.
You don't want to blow the straps out of

732
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,460
your group and you want to stay there as
long as possible.

733
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,080
Okay?
So that's a niche.

734
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,670
Think about that.
That's a niche.

735
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,350
It's complicated because the niche 
involves success in climbing and then it

736
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:34,190
involves success in maintaining and 
upper most position.

737
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,150
Okay,
so and that for chimps that requires not

738
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,984
only the capacity to be aggressive but 
also the capacity to be cooperative and 

739
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,204
empathic.
So one of the things to all discovered 

740
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:50,930
for example,
is that the chimp who stays on top first

741
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:51,764
of all can make coalitions,
so there's a lot of reciprocal grooming 

742
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:54,590
and so on,
so he's,

743
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,690
he can make friends even though he's 
kind of,

744
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,740
you know,
he's tough,

745
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,143
but he also pays a lot of attention to 
the females and the infants in the 

746
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:02,870
troop.
So,

747
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,973
so whatever constitutes sovereignty,
let's say from a chimp perspective is a 

748
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,460
lot more complex than mere power.
Okay,

749
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:11,660
so fine.
So that's chimps.

750
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:12,494
Now we're chimps,
so you already got the origin of human 

751
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:18,170
ethics to some degree in that it's like 
get to the top,

752
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,690
but don't be too much of a print when 
you're there,

753
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:21,410
so to speak.

754
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,580
Right?
You have to,

755
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,640
you have to let you have to rule well,
making allowances for those,

756
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,643
for making and make allowances for the 
fact that those you ruled over have 

757
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:35,504
value.
Now that's an interesting thing because 

758
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,340
now what you've done is if you've 
introduced the,

759
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,263
not the idea,
but the fact that even a defeated other 

760
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,260
is a valuable part of the group,
okay?

761
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:50,180
Now that that's starting to get 
morality,

762
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:52,430
they're starting to get fairly deep 
because that's kind of like,

763
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,830
well,
the outcasts still has value.

764
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,233
Okay,
now you come to human beings and you 

765
00:43:58,431 --> 00:43:58,971
think,
okay,

766
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:03,020
well what's what makes a human being 
successful in the dominance hierarchy?

767
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,711
You can say,
well,

768
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,740
it's the same thing the chimps have and 
that's right,

769
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,980
except that human beings have one other 
thing.

770
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,540
At least they can make new dominance 
hierarchies.

771
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,640
That's what creativity is,
right?

772
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,070
So you invent a new something and you 
can erect a dominance hierarchy rounded.

773
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,750
So if you can't climb the dominance 
hierarchy that's already here,

774
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,681
you can just say,
well,

775
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,980
here's a new thing and we'll make it a 
little dominance hierarchy over there.

776
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,963
So now you've got the addition of the 
capacity to transform the dominance 

777
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:33,624
hierarchy as another thing that's 
contributing to dominance hierarchy 

778
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,890
success.
Okay,

779
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:38,724
so I believe that what's come out of 
that is the idea that this is such a 

780
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,234
great idea so that the top of the 
dominant Turkey is the right place to 

781
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:50,004
be,
but the top of all potential sets of 

782
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:56,310
dominance hierarchies is a better place 
to be,

783
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,863
and I think were selected to be the top 
of the set of potential dominance 

784
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:05,340
hierarchies,
and that means in some sense,

785
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:06,174
if you're at the top,
you're not at the top of ad dominant 

786
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:10,590
Turkey.
You're at the top of,

787
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,330
okay,
so now imagine this.

788
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,300
So now imagine a landscape,
okay?

789
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,133
Far as you can see,
it's a plane and there's pyramids all 

790
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:20,580
over it,
of different sizes,

791
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:21,414
right?
And you're flying above it and use zoom 

792
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,654
into a pyramid and you see all people 
packed inside trying to climb to the 

793
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:28,104
top,
but there's pyramids everywhere where 

794
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,880
people are doing this,
but you're flying along the top.

795
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,690
Okay,
well that's as far as I can tell.

796
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:39,120
That's the Egyptian God.
Horus.

797
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,050
Horus isn't in the pyramid.
He's above the pyramid.

798
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,663
So.
And he's the eye because horace is the 

799
00:45:46,771 --> 00:45:47,604
eye and so horace stands for attention.
And so there's this idea that the 

800
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:55,140
Egyptian start to play with that one of 
the most important,

801
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:58,560
God's Osiris,
and he's like God of the pyramid.

802
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,740
He stands for security and stability and
the past.

803
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,340
But he can be wiped out by various 
means.

804
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:07,260
So he's not permanent enough in some 
sense.

805
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:08,340
Or he lacks something.

806
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,780
Father Architect essentially.
Yes.

807
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,410
Osiris is the father,
the great father.

808
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,150
It's half of the archetype because he's 
the.

809
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,910
He started the positive element of the 
great father.

810
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,830
He's,
he's not the negative element,

811
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:20,664
although he makes himself susceptible to
the negative element by being willfully 

812
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,450
blind.
Okay.

813
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,860
So his son is horace and horace is the 
eye of Horus pays attention.

814
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,350
So the Egyptians are starting to get the
idea that,

815
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,690
well you should be,
oh cyrus.

816
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,510
That means you're the embodiment of the 
dominance hierarchy.

817
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,580
Say,
but you also should be horus,

818
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:39,414
which is the thing that pays attention 
because the dominance hierarchy as it's 

819
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:46,080
currently structured may be 
restructured.

820
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:49,320
And then so you don't want to just be 
adapted to this dominance hierarchy.

821
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,220
You want to be adapted.
So if it transforms it structure,

822
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,450
that's no problem for you.
Because you're not stuck in it,

823
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,060
you're in it and not in it at the same 
time.

824
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,490
And that's the big contribution of 
Egyptian thought.

825
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:04,740
I think it's brilliant.
Brilliant.

826
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,990
Just a slight tangent,
what you're talking about there,

827
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,370
just to make that distinction clear for 
other people.

828
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,190
When the Egyptians are experimenting 
with these ideas,

829
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,120
are you saying that they're doing this 
consciously or this is a,

830
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,690
um,
uh,

831
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,813
some,
some sort of natural happens 

832
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:30,610
automatically level representation?
Yeah.

833
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:32,230
Well think about it this way.
So,

834
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,183
so imagine that one of the things that 
characterize whether or not you can 

835
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:36,514
climb the dominant Turkeys,
how good you are at watching people who 

836
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:40,660
can climb the dominant Turkey and 
imitating them.

837
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,800
Okay.
So that means that part of it's going to

838
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,460
be built in your biology because you've 
been at,

839
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,410
you know,
the dominance hierarchy has been working

840
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,244
on you for a long time.
So you have the capability of being the 

841
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,234
thing that can climb.
But then let's say you get an edge by 

842
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:58,510
watching someone who's successfully 
climbing because they're like adapted to

843
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:01,420
the current circumstances precisely and 
you can imitate them.

844
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,950
Okay.
Then the question is,

845
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,113
well,

846
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:05,893
what does it mean to imitate them and 
what it means is you can model their 

847
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:10,520
behavior with your behavior.
Okay,

848
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,580
so that's a form of.
That's a form of representation.

849
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,380
Okay,
now you've got it.

850
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,573
Now we're all watching each other and we
find those people who can climb up 

851
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:21,470
dominance.
Turkey is very interesting.

852
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,810
So we tell,
we start to tell stories about them,

853
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:28,010
which is the representation of behavior 
in image and articulation.

854
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,413
So it's like you tell the story about 
some interesting person that you admire 

855
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,430
and then it's a pretty good story so 
other people remember it,

856
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:38,264
but then it sort of gets commingled in 
with some other stories about some 

857
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:41,564
interesting people who can climb the 
dominance hierarchy and then thousands 

858
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:44,804
of you gathering those stories all have 
a war over centuries and what you 

859
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:49,394
extract out of it is like the most 
interesting person who's the best at 

860
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:52,904
climbing the dominance hierarchy and 
that's where you start to get the idea 

861
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:59,330
of the savior and so it's a bottom up 
process and so.

862
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:02,660
And then once that's.
Once you started to get that,

863
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,320
well then the process can be more than 
merely.

864
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,133
You can start to understand and model in
some sense what the principles are that 

865
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:20,330
govern success,
but it's universal success,

866
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:22,430
right?
It's not success in a given hierarchy.

867
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,910
It's like what are the principles that 
guarantee universal success?

868
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,313
So you might say,
well that's the ultimate question of 

869
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,090
life.
It's like,

870
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,400
yes,
that is the ultimate question of life.

871
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,700
So what did the Egyptians figure out 
while they figured out that,

872
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:38,060
oh,
cyrus was a good guy,

873
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,380
you need it,
but he's Kinda blind because he's old,

874
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,113
can be any.
He's willfully blind to and that makes 

875
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:52,091
them susceptible to the forces that want
to overturn the hierarchy.

876
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:55,040
But the negative forces,
the ones that just want to destroy,

877
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:57,440
that's his brother Seth.
So Oh,

878
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,790
cyrus remains willfully blind and he let
seth basically chop them into pieces and

879
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,770
distributed throughout the Egyptian 
state.

880
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,930
So things fall apart and seth rule.

881
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,763
So the Egyptians had already figured out
in models that the hierarchy can become 

882
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,080
probably corrupted by power and deceit,
something like that.

883
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:15,943
Right?
So it's no longer functioning as it 

884
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,764
should.
And it can continually do that instead 

885
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:23,320
it descends into chaos or that's just 
sort of.

886
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,261
Yeah,
yeah.

887
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,020
Well it's the demolition of order and 
well,

888
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,930
when Isis makes her appearance,
because she's goddess of chaos.

889
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:30,764
It's like outcomes.
Isis and her husband is so cyrus and 

890
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,320
he's all chopped up.
So she goes around Egypt.

891
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,483
He's not killed because you can't kill 
those cyrus because he's the dominance 

892
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:40,790
hierarchy.
You can disrupt it,

893
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,970
you can break it into pieces,
but it's going to come back together.

894
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,230
So isis wanders around Egypt trying to 
find his fellas.

895
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,710
So she finally does and she makes 
herself pregnant with it.

896
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:55,370
And so the idea there is that when the 
pieces of society fall into chaos,

897
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,720
they're still alive.

898
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,850
So something new can be born out of 
them.

899
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,743
Right?
It's like the creative destruction that 

900
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:04,000
the economists talk about.
Isis makes herself pregnant.

901
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:09,030
She gives birth to horace.
Now Horace is Cyrus his son.

902
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,240
But the big difference between him and,
oh Cyrus,

903
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:14,150
is that he can see he's not willfully 
blind.

904
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,640
In fact,
he's the opposite of willfully blind.

905
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,450
He's almost only the eye,
the famous Egyptian I,

906
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,403
he's also a falcon.
And Falcons are those things that fly 

907
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:25,430
above and they can really,
really,

908
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:30,140
really see.
So horace grows up outside the kingdom.

909
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,013
Well,
why?

910
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,873
Everybody grows up outside the kingdom 
because the old kingdom has always 

911
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:37,850
corrupt and are archaic and willfully 
blind,

912
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:38,684
so you're always alienated from it.
So alienation is like a permanent 

913
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:41,984
element of being.
But then horace goes and because he can 

914
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:46,154
see,
he sees seth for who he is and then he 

915
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:52,241
has a horrible fight with seth and he 
wins and then he bandaged his seth.

916
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:53,923
Now you can't kill him because he said 
it's like the fact that dominance 

917
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,640
hierarchies can become corrupt is an 
eternal facts.

918
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,080
So there is no getting rid of seth,
but you can get rid of them temporarily.

919
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,573
So when he gets rid of them,
he steals his eye back and then you 

920
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:07,851
think,
okay,

921
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:08,684
well he's got rid of whole seth.
It's like he's got the kingdom end of 

922
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:12,230
story,
but the,

923
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,970
that is what happens.
Horace takes his eye.

924
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,373
He goes back down to chaos and 
underworld and finds those cyrus down 

925
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,320
there who sort of like,
you know,

926
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,110
he's a ghost,
is a shade of his former self,

927
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,333
and horace gives him his eye,
so now cyrus can see with the eyes of 

928
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:30,764
youth and then horace and Noah Cyrus go 
back to really the kingdom together and 

929
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:40,160
the Pharaoh is Osiris and horus 
together.

930
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,090
If he's a good feral.

931
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,620
So that means he's wisdom and tradition 
and attention and that's,

932
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,080
that's you're starting to get very close
there.

933
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,400
Now the Egyptians identified that 
horace,

934
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,540
so cyrus thing with the immortal soul.
It's like,

935
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,374
yes,
they're right and it's not some trivial 

936
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:58,540
superstition.
It's,

937
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,900
it's there,
right?

938
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,750
That is the immortal soul.
It's the thing,

939
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:03,950
it's the,
it's,

940
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,790
it's the best in each person.
That's another way of thinking about it.

941
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,624
Now you know that those ideas get much 
more developed as we get much more 

942
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:17,840
civilized.
So by the end of the Egyptian periods,

943
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,240
they call this the democratization of 
Cyrus,

944
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:25,010
although only the Pharaoh to begin with 
could sort of use the symbolism that was

945
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,853
associated with Cyrus Horace.
It sort of spread down the dominance 

946
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:31,680
hierarchy.
So and then for me,

947
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,680
what happens after that is that while it
starts to get universalized,

948
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:35,514
right?
So this is not a particularly linear 

949
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,330
progression,
but for the sake of simplicity,

950
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,850
we can make the case.

951
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,830
The Greeks give every adult male a soul,
right?

952
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,130
Well,
by the time Christianity rolls around,

953
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:50,964
it's like,
Oh huh.

954
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,040
Isn't it weird?
Everybody has a soul.

955
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,410
Even the Weirdos that you'd rather get 
rid of.

956
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,660
Even those things that you think of as 
enemies,

957
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,030
it's like it's in people.
Okay,

958
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:00,864
now Christianity really starts to play 
around with exactly what the hell this 

959
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,150
soul is.
And they,

960
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,143
you know,
the ideas come out in very bizarre ways 

961
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,800
and like the,
the,

962
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,663
one of the most bizarre ways is that 
Christianity makes the assumption that 

963
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:15,594
the word of God,
that that pulls order out of chaos at 

964
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:22,380
the beginning of time.
So logos is the thing.

965
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,090
That's Christ.
You know?

966
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,350
So many eons later they're the same 
thing.

967
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:27,900
It's like,
well,

968
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,850
what the hell does that mean?
Well,

969
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:34,851
it's like if you embody the immortal 
soul pro properly,

970
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,993
your,
the thing that generates order from 

971
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,920
chaos or sometimes the reverse you make,
you know,

972
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,900
you're the transforming agent that sits 
at the middle of order and chaos.

973
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,433
Okay,
so that's the same thing that was there 

974
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,320
in the beginning.
Well,

975
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:50,154
that's the beginning of,
of being not the beginning of the 

976
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:53,860
universe.
It's the beginning of being.

977
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,160
Those aren't the same thing.
So.

978
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,263
And the Christians figure out that this 
logo's thing is very much associated 

979
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:03,930
with articulated truth,
articulated truth.

980
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,170
And so the Christian idea in part is,
and this is,

981
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,040
this is where Dj had it wrong,
I think because he was,

982
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,740
he was,
he was too cynical about cyrus.

983
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,574
He was too cynical about Christianity.
He thought all it was was rotten 

984
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,890
infrastructure,
you know,

985
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:23,724
so he,
he saw how it had become dogmatize and 

986
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,850
corrupted across time,
but he didn't see what was in the center

987
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:30,684
of it and you know,
his superman was sort of a substitute 

988
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:36,150
for that.
But he never fleshed that out.

989
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:36,984
Well,
but young started to play with the 

990
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:38,754
superman idea and with the idea of the 
philosopher stone and he was studying 

991
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,820
Christianity and at one point he thought
he saw,

992
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,710
oh,
those are the same thing.

993
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,100
They're all the same thing.
It's complicated,

994
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,340
but one of the things that you 
recognized was that the core doctrine of

995
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:56,874
Christianity in some sense is the truth 
buttresses you most thoroughly against 

996
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,640
the vicissitudes of being.
That's your salvation,

997
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,710
the truth,
the spoken truth.

998
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,120
It's not so you might say,
well,

999
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:19,260
people say,
Christians say,

1000
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:20,580
well,
if you believe in Christ,

1001
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:22,320
you're saved.
Well,

1002
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,120
what do you mean by belief?
Exactly?

1003
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,630
You say,
Jesus Christ is the son of God,

1004
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,823
and you say,
I believe that just because you say 

1005
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,880
that,
it doesn't mean you believe it at all.

1006
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,400
It has almost no bearing on what you 
believe.

1007
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,683
The question is how do you act and the 
fundamental question that's under all 

1008
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:45,670
that is,
is your speech true?

1009
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,560
Now?
Then you might ask,

1010
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:48,670
well,
what is true mean?

1011
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,440
Well,
unanswered.

1012
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,540
That would be.
There's twofold.

1013
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,750
What are you trying to do with your 
speech?

1014
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,053
There's two things you can do with it.
One is you can manipulate reality so 

1015
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:02,194
that it does what you want it to do,
so and that's the sort of speech that 

1016
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,260
people use when they're trying to get 
what they want.

1017
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,060
The problem with that is that there's no
way that they.

1018
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,283
They can't actually know what they want.
They just hypothesize what it is that 

1019
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:17,344
they want based on some theory,
and then they try to manipulate the 

1020
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:21,424
world so that they get that,
but it's an unsatisfying venture and 

1021
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:26,530
often when they do get it,
it's not good anyways,

1022
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,010
so and it involves a kind of falsity of 
speech.

1023
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,023
The other way is to try to say what you 
mean and think and perceive as clearly 

1024
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:40,630
as you possibly can always and see what 
happens.

1025
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,740
Now the,
the story that underlies Christianity,

1026
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:45,574
and it's not only Christianity but 
Christianity that I'm most familiar 

1027
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:48,724
with,
is that the rule is live in accordance 

1028
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:56,500
with the truth and see what happens.
So in the sermon on the Mount,

1029
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:58,630
for example,
Christ basically says,

1030
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,530
set your sights on allegiance to God.
It's like whatever the highest value is,

1031
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:12,541
we'll say and act in a manner that's 
concurrent with that.

1032
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,103
So that's your goal.
Then pay attention to the here and now 

1033
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,360
your best strategy for the future.
Well,

1034
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,580
you know,
then you might say,

1035
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,391
well,
prove that.

1036
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:23,620
It's like,
well,

1037
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,990
that's when the question starts to 
become existential.

1038
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:26,921
It's like,
well,

1039
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,420
you can't prove it.
You have to try it.

1040
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,060
That's like character guards,
leap of faith.

1041
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,690
You cannot tell if this works unless you
do it.

1042
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,470
And that's a commitment.
It's like it.

1043
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,360
Those two ways of being like the 
manipulative way of being.

1044
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:42,660
That's an adversarial way of being 
architecturally.

1045
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,700
It's manipulative.
It's got the lie at its core.

1046
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,760
That's completely different than this 
path.

1047
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:50,963
So.
So it's a hypothesis while inside 

1048
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,300
apotheosis that you and get a good job 
of elaborating.

1049
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,190
Although you know,
even with young,

1050
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,953
it's not fully articulated.
He still saturated and image to a large 

1051
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:03,184
degree,
but no wonder it's very complicated to 

1052
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:07,480
make this,
this sort of thing fully articulated.

1053
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,850
You read Solzhenitsyn's,
you think,

1054
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:10,684
okay,
why did the Soviet Union become the 

1055
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:15,670
absolute hell hole that it was sold 
units and says,

1056
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,370
because everyone lied.
It's like,

1057
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,750
oh,
isn't that interesting?

1058
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:21,830
Well,
that isn't the hypothesis you hear every

1059
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:22,664
day.
So then you think about Freud and you 

1060
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:24,711
think,
well,

1061
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,870
what's the major cause of mental 
illness?

1062
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,910
Repression?
Well,

1063
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:31,160
that's a lie.
Fundamentally.

1064
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,580
I mean Freud's played around with it to 
some degree,

1065
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:35,414
so it's sort of like,
it's more like lying by omission 

1066
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:44,200
actually than lying by omission,
but it doesn't matter.

1067
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:46,570
It's still lying young says the same 
thing.

1068
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,261
It's like,
oh,

1069
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,094
well,
wouldn't it be interesting if the 

1070
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:52,000
fundamental root of psychopathology was 
the lie?

1071
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,540
The fundamental root of political 
psychopathology is the lie.

1072
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,913
It's like,
well,

1073
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,830
what if that's what's demolishing your 
life?

1074
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,270
You know,
people say,

1075
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:05,100
well,
people think,

1076
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,950
especially when they're nihilistic and 
they and they become destructive,

1077
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:08,784
that the universe is sort of,
it's an unfair and arbitrary place and 

1078
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:14,400
it's basically bent on their random 
destruction.

1079
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:15,360
Well,
they suffer.

1080
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,580
It's something like that.
Yeah.

1081
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,170
Right.
Okay.

1082
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,480
What do you do under those 
circumstances?

1083
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:23,610
That's the question.
Well,

1084
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,103
one potential answer is twist the thing 
so that you can maybe get what you 

1085
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:33,660
hypothetically want out of it.
The other is

1086
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,600
rely on your perceptions and your 
capacity for accurate representation.

1087
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:44,940
Communicate that and take your chances.
It's like who's right?

1088
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,340
Well,
that's the battle between good and evil,

1089
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,790
who's right.
It's a continual battle.

1090
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,860
I think it's really important to drive 
home this notion of right and truth.

1091
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,100
You're talking about here as in terms of
action,

1092
01:00:59,130 --> 01:00:59,963
what is the right action?
Because action is essentially is almost 

1093
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:03,984
the unit of truth that you're.
That you're hypothesizing based on but 

1094
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,010
for,
but for most people,

1095
01:01:11,011 --> 01:01:11,844
I think when they hear the word truth,
especially people in academia or people 

1096
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:18,810
are involved in the sciences in any way,
they think of something very different.

1097
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,520
Yes,
of course.

1098
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:24,000
And their truth is representational.
Right?

1099
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,440
So can you elaborate?
Maybe.

1100
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,580
See,
that's also.

1101
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,533
That's also partly why the Catholic 
church historically has been so put off 

1102
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,980
by the rational intellect.
You know,

1103
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:36,780
like people like dark and say,
well,

1104
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:37,411
you know,
yeah.

1105
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:40,620
They went after Galileo because he was 
undermining their superstitions.

1106
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:41,910
It's like,
yeah.

1107
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:47,450
Partly right,
the other part was seth,

1108
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,443
like the figure of evil throughout 
history is always the hyper rational 

1109
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:56,460
intellect and the reason for that is the
intellect is God's highest angel,

1110
01:01:56,461 --> 01:02:00,660
so that's Lucifer and it falls in love 
with its own creations.

1111
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:03,420
It likes to make totalities out of its 
own creation.

1112
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,660
Once there's a totality,
there's no room for the transcendent.

1113
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:11,070
There is no god that Satan's error by 
the way and everything immediately turns

1114
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:11,904
into hail.
Now you see that was all put together 

1115
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:19,191
particularly well by Milton.
Milton was a visionary and what felt and

1116
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:22,044
put together was the images stick sub 
straight out of which the totalitarian 

1117
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:27,870
states we're going to grow.

1118
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,150
He envisioned it.
Now it was visionary,

1119
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:30,984
right?
He saw it as a battle between heavenly 

1120
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:35,100
agents,
but he codified it and he said,

1121
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:35,934
well,
you know,

1122
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:39,000
here's.
Here's the approaching problem.

1123
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,720
Here's the problem.
That totalitarian intellect,

1124
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,250
it's like,
and that's exactly right.

1125
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,353
If you.
If you talk to people who are suffering 

1126
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,510
existentially,
they're always in love with the products

1127
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:53,490
of their intellect.
They do not pay attention.

1128
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,481
They say,
well,

1129
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:57,210
I can't see how my life has any meaning 
and answered.

1130
01:02:57,211 --> 01:03:02,211
That is you're not seeing your thinking 
and you can easily think yourself into a

1131
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:06,870
corner where your life has no meaning.
It's a cheap trick I can say,

1132
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,450
who cares about this documentary?
No one.

1133
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:11,700
It's not going to matter in a billion 
years,

1134
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,130
right?
Or in a hundred years or whatever.

1135
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,820
I can pick a timeframe within which this
event is irrelevant.

1136
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,163
Okay,
so then you can derive from that fact 

1137
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:22,583
that it's irrelevant or you can derive 
from that fact that that's a stupid way 

1138
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:30,840
to think so and you can.

1139
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,733
You can derive the conclusion that it's 
a stupid way to think if you haven't 

1140
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,564
made thinking you're God so and there's 
lots of other things that work better 

1141
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:41,634
than thinking.
Paying attention is better than 

1142
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:44,820
thinking.
It's much better than thinking.

1143
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,970
Paying attention allows you to listen to
people who don't agree with you.

1144
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,360
Paying attention allows you to learn 
things that you don't already know,

1145
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,580
so you know if it's thinking or 
attention,

1146
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:54,414
that should be the God.
It's like attention rules thinking 

1147
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:02,670
that's a subordinate phenomena,
but it likes to pop up on top,

1148
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,451
you know,
because it likes.

1149
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:06,090
It's a little tight theories and it 
likes to be right.

1150
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,470
Well,
you know,

1151
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,860
forget that you're not going to be 
right.

1152
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,760
You could say that the image of Christ 
is the West's attempt to most accurately

1153
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:21,384
represent the,
the path of being that constitutes 

1154
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:29,760
success across an infinite set of 
dominance hierarchies.

1155
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,800
That's,
that's essentially.

1156
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:32,783
Or that's,
that's at least one way of looking at 

1157
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:35,190
it.
Now there are figures,

1158
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,790
hero figures,
you know,

1159
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,470
because Christ is like a hero,
but he's sort of a Meta hero,

1160
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,580
right?
He's the amalgam of many,

1161
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:42,391
many,
many,

1162
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,970
many heroes.
But the hero is,

1163
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,760
has key attributes.
Like the hero for example,

1164
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:50,400
is always encountering chaos and 
defeating it.

1165
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,080
Well,
that's the human path.

1166
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,650
You know,
we encountered chaos so often the snake,

1167
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:56,903
well,
that also points to it's deep 

1168
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:02,340
evolutionary roots.
So there's a anthropologist,

1169
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:04,380
Lynn,
Isabelle,

1170
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,930
who wrote a book a while back called the
tree,

1171
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:07,764
the serpent and vision.
I think I've got that right and she was 

1172
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:10,764
interested in why human beings can see 
so well because we can see really well 

1173
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,650
the only things that can see better than
us are birds of prey.

1174
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,160
And she thought,
well why

1175
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,320
would a primate like us have such good 
vision?

1176
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,663
So she went around the world.
She thought she knew also that we were 

1177
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:29,350
particularly good at detecting the kind 
of camouflage patterns that characterize

1178
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:30,184
snakes,
especially in the lower half of our 

1179
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,880
visual field.
And she was kind of curious about that.

1180
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:34,720
And then she thought,
well,

1181
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:35,823
you know,
maybe we were preyed upon by snakes and 

1182
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,224
you know,
maybe we had to develop good vision 

1183
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,160
because we were preyed upon by snakes 
like 60 million years ago,

1184
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,420
way back when we weren't even people,
which is about how old snakes are.

1185
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,280
It's like 60 million years,
something like that.

1186
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,533
So then she went around the world and 
she correlated the acuity of primate 

1187
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:55,510
vision with the prevalence of predatory 
snakes.

1188
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,300
It's like nice correlation.
So she thought,

1189
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,340
oh,
human beings in snakes coevolved.

1190
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,760
Well,
so what gives you vision snakes?

1191
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,530
That's what it says in Genesis.

1192
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,570
What else gives you vision?
Fruit.

1193
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,210
That's also right.
That's why we have color vision,

1194
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,460
right?
What makes you self conscious?

1195
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:14,380
If you're a man,
women,

1196
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:16,600
right?
That's eve.

1197
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,320
So you know the stories in the Bible,
the pre flood stories,

1198
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,373
they're really old.
We have no idea how old they are and 

1199
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,603
like they're extremely old and you might
say well and story for well like actual 

1200
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:34,930
story for them.
God only knows how old they are,

1201
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,490
but in terms of behavioral pattern that 
could easily be 60 million years old.

1202
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:40,953
It's like the thing that defeats the 
snake gets the women and you imagine 

1203
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:49,570
that in tree dwelling primates say well 
upcoming the snakes.

1204
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,420
It's like the first guy who figured out 
how to drop a stick on a snake.

1205
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,160
He was very popular so you know,
and so the snake,

1206
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:57,994
what's happened is that religion.
So what what's happened as far as I can 

1207
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,304
tell is that the systems that our brain 
evolved to detect basically rapacious 

1208
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:10,060
predators.
It's not just snakes,

1209
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:13,840
but it'd be like reptiles with teeth,

1210
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:18,150
predators in the dark,
things under the water,

1211
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:19,440
like,
like crocodiles.

1212
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:24,000
That's like,
that's the lurking a normally,

1213
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,043
right?
It's the thing you have to contend with 

1214
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,110
and it's actually a monster.
You know,

1215
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:31,560
people say monsters aren't real,
so like it depends on your timeframe.

1216
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:32,873
If you add up and average all the 
predatory monsters across 60 million 

1217
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:37,620
years,
you get a monster.

1218
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,860
Okay.
The,

1219
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,720
the,
so the,

1220
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:40,554
the,
the Amalgam of monster is a 

1221
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:47,670
representation of the class of predatory
stimuli.

1222
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,650
That might be a way of looking at it.
Okay.

1223
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:52,710
So we're very sensitive to that because 
we were prey animals.

1224
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:53,843
Okay.
Then our cortex leapt up a level of 

1225
01:07:56,431 --> 01:07:57,264
abstraction,
so then that same system started to 

1226
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:00,264
detect anomaly as such.
It wasn't just the predatory thing that 

1227
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:04,644
was outside the dominance hierarchy.
It was the abstract thing that was 

1228
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,990
outside the system of ideas.
It's the same thing,

1229
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,943
and so that became symbolized by the 
chaos monster and we can easily throw 

1230
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:15,920
that our enemies.

1231
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:16,851
It's like,
well,

1232
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:18,470
who are you?
You're outside the hierarchy.

1233
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,450
Oh,
you're a chaos monster.

1234
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,980
While yes you are,
that's not a arbitrary prejudice.

1235
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,320
It's like you are absolutely a chaos 
monster.

1236
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,260
Then the question is,
what do you do with chaos monsters?

1237
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,580
One answer is killed them.
The other answer is get their gold.

1238
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,103
That's a better answer because there's 
information in chaos and we're 

1239
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:42,200
information scavengers,
and that's our niche.

1240
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:45,980
It's like outside what we know.
There's information.

1241
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:51,200
You might die retrieving it,
but if you don't die,

1242
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,050
you're like a major hero.
Yep.

1243
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,003
That's great.

1244
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,123
So is this the sense in which these 
religious or philosophical stories and 

1245
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:03,510
images are true?
Yeah,

1246
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:04,344
in the sense that they instruct action 
in a way that in the Darwinian sense is 

1247
01:09:10,591 --> 01:09:11,320
true.

1248
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,020
Great.
And that's the only sense in which truth

1249
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,760
exists.
Well,

1250
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:17,050
if you're a Darwinian,
right,

1251
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,063
right.
So that's the problem with modern 

1252
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,654
scientists.
It's like,

1253
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,350
are you Newtonian or are you Darwinian?
It's like Newton.

1254
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,480
He's wrong by the way.
Right?

1255
01:09:25,481 --> 01:09:28,870
We already know that because Newton's 
only a subset of Einstein,

1256
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,733
let's say,
and God only knows what the whole 

1257
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:32,194
quantum thing is going to end up being.
We don't even know how to structure our 

1258
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:37,450
thought in accordance with those 
presuppositions,

1259
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,130
but Darwin,
trump's newton.

1260
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,160
That's my hypothesis.
So you know,

1261
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,683
you might say those who have.
So then the question is what attitude 

1262
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:52,000
towards religion is truly scientific,
right?

1263
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:55,480
I think my attitude towards religion is 
precisely scientific.

1264
01:09:56,290 --> 01:10:01,290
So because it's predicated on Darwinian 
really on Darwinian presuppositions,

1265
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,140
Dawkins is a rationalist.
He's not a Darwinian.

1266
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,730
He just thinks he's a Darwinian.

1267
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:07,831
Okay.
Can we.

1268
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:08,664
Can we.
Can we explore this a little bit in 

1269
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:10,884
terms of,
in terms of describing how you're 

1270
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,900
working with these definitions and 
terms.

1271
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,023
When you say that your approach to 
religion is a Darwinian one and 

1272
01:10:18,451 --> 01:10:20,220
doctrines is unwittingly perhaps

1273
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:22,450
he's an enlightenment guy,
right?

1274
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,373
So enlightened lightened is dislike.
It's really thin paint on a mile deep 

1275
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,580
piece of rock.
It's nothing.

1276
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,833
One of the things I really liked about 
reading young was that young tracks the 

1277
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:37,720
development of thought.
Say Back Ten thousand years.

1278
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,583
It's like,
wow,

1279
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,750
that's a 10,000
year span of history.

1280
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,670
That's a long time.
It's like,

1281
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,890
well,
not compared to 300 million years.

1282
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,990
That's a really long time.
Okay.

1283
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:47,824
So if we're going to talk about the 
Darwinian underpinnings of the brain or 

1284
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:54,700
of the human organism,
let's use some time spans.

1285
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,720
So darkens has darwinism painted on 
enlightenment,

1286
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,200
rationality.
He's a postseason enlightenment guides,

1287
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:02,530
like rationality,
rules.

1288
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,450
It's like this is how you make sense of 
the world.

1289
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:05,471
So like,
okay,

1290
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,290
well we thought that more or less for 
400 years.

1291
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,800
So what did we think for the other like 
300 million years?

1292
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,700
How did we manage without that?
If it's truth?

1293
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,553
So it's a form of truth.
It's a partial form of truth and it's a 

1294
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:28,860
powerful partial form of truth.
But to say it's truth.

1295
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,370
Well then it depends on what you mean by
truth.

1296
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,960
So yeah.
Well,

1297
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,410
and that's where it gets back and 
that's,

1298
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,980
that's where it starts to go back into 
the Darwinian issue,

1299
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:38,814
which is there's only one way you can 
define truth in relationship to finite 

1300
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:44,910
beings.
It's true enough,

1301
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,523
true enough for what?
True enough so that you survive and 

1302
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:51,030
reproduce.
That's it.

1303
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,970
You don't get to go any farther.
What's,

1304
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,780
what's more true than that?
Sorry,

1305
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,120
can't ask that question.
That's it.

1306
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:00,780
You've hit the limit and that's 
basically Darwin's claim and that's what

1307
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:02,460
the pragmatist recognized as well.

1308
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:03,483
So it was another way of really helpful.
What you just went through can be very 

1309
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:09,940
useful,
so is another way of articulating that.

1310
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:11,103
What's true is what enables you to 
successfully achieve a goal and you 

1311
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:16,910
know,

1312
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:17,630
yeah,
no,

1313
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,640
that's what.
That's what's true enough,

1314
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,253
but there's only true enough,
but there's like there's varieties of 

1315
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:27,800
true enough so it doesn't turn you into 
a relativist.

1316
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,440
It's like some things are only true for 
one thing.

1317
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:31,483
Some things are true for 10 things,
some things are true for a million 

1318
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:35,660
things.
It's like,

1319
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:37,580
well that's a better truth.
Well,

1320
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:40,700
in what what,
what the religious imagination,

1321
01:12:40,701 --> 01:12:41,534
which is the imagination that's 
concerned with values is always trying 

1322
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:46,340
to determine is well,
what's the highest value?

1323
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,430
That's the religious question.
What's the highest value?

1324
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,810
Which is what should you serve,
let's say,

1325
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,920
to ensure your viability across the 
broadest domain of time.

1326
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:06,470
While we don't know,
so what we've done is,

1327
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,420
well,
we've watched successful people.

1328
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,130
What does successful mean?
Well,

1329
01:13:10,131 --> 01:13:10,964
we know what it means,
where we can stay within the Darwinian 

1330
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:13,970
framework.
I mean,

1331
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:14,900
I don't think,
by the way,

1332
01:13:14,901 --> 01:13:15,734
I don't think the Darwinian framework is
the last word on things because we're 

1333
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:20,510
starting to discover,
for example,

1334
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,240
that there are epigenetic 
transformation,

1335
01:13:23,241 --> 01:13:25,070
so you know,
we'll see where that goes.

1336
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:26,630
It's going to go somewhere very 
interesting,

1337
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:27,710
but that's okay.
For,

1338
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:28,730
for the time being

1339
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,530
were were,
were enamored of successful people.

1340
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,720
Okay,
there's success.

1341
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,570
There's a successful person,
a successful person,

1342
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:40,404
be there,
successful person c and what makes them 

1343
01:13:42,121 --> 01:13:45,120
the same is that they're successful.
Okay.

1344
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:45,954
Then the question is what is successful?
Well then in some sense the variations 

1345
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:55,260
of Harold Mythology are complex answers 
to that question.

1346
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,341
It's like,
well,

1347
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:57,174
if you're a hero,
you're successful while there's a bunch 

1348
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:00,210
of different kinds of heroes.
Okay,

1349
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:02,820
so you get all of these heroes together.
Now have a big fight.

1350
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,610
Who comes up on top?
Well,

1351
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:06,953
I can tell you one answer to that 
because that's exactly what happens in 

1352
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:12,100
Mesopotamian mythology.
It's there's a bunch of heroes,

1353
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,113
their gods,
and then they're confronted by a 

1354
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:18,520
horrible chaos monster that actually 
gave birth to them.

1355
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,970
That's time at and they,
these gods,

1356
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:26,971
they know that singly,
she'll just plow them to nothing,

1357
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,863
so they're all freaking out about this 
and then at one point a new God gets 

1358
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,124
born,
his name is Martin and he's kind of an 

1359
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:35,824
interest in God because he could speak 
magic words and his eyes all the way 

1360
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:39,484
around his head so they send out a god 
now and then to go after time out 

1361
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:44,983
because she's angry with them for like 
making too much racket essentially and 

1362
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:48,430
killing her husband.

1363
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,860
It's not a very good idea.
They're careless.

1364
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,083
They're like two year olds really?
So they throw out a god now and then to 

1365
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:58,120
go fight time out,
but she just wants them.

1366
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,070
There's not even any contest.
So they're,

1367
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,240
this martyr is born in Negros up and 
they're pretty impressed with him.

1368
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:05,920
So they asked him one day,
well,

1369
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:07,660
how would you like to go out and fight 
time at?

1370
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,030
And you know,
maybe he's not too thrilled about that,

1371
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,620
but he says,
okay,

1372
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:12,311
okay,
I'll do it.

1373
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:14,500
But here's the rule.
Call a council.

1374
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,870
You put me in charge,
I'm top God.

1375
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,720
And that means from here on in,
I determined destiny,

1376
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:24,580
so he's the thing that determines the 
way the future's going to unfold and you

1377
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:25,870
know,
they're not that happy about that,

1378
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:26,704
but they arranged them into a hierarchy 
and they put them on top and then he 

1379
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:32,200
goes out and he catches tie matt into 
net.

1380
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:34,780
So we conceptualize as her,
so to speak,

1381
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,900
counselor into pieces makes the world 
out of her.

1382
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,760
It's like that's what a human being 
does.

1383
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,900
Pays attention to where the chaos is,
encapsulates it,

1384
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,700
cuts it up,
makes the world.

1385
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,880
One of his names was actually he who 
makes ingenious things out of the combat

1386
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,280
with ty.
Matt was actually like a literal name of

1387
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:55,114
Martin.
And so the Mesopotamian emperor had to 

1388
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:58,624
imitate Martin.
So to the degree that he had 

1389
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:03,010
sovereignty,
the reason he had sovereignty was he,

1390
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:07,070
he was a Martech and then he could be a 
good martech or a bad mark.

1391
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:11,590
So at the New Year's festival,
they'd take the king outside the city.

1392
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,453
So that's out into chaos.
They'd strip him of his kingly clothes 

1393
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,083
and then they'd make them kneel and then
he had to confess to all the ways that 

1394
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,520
year he hadn't been a very good martech.

1395
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,410
They'd actually hit him with something 
first.

1396
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,393
Then he had to confess while I wasn't a 
good mark this way or that way and you 

1397
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:28,960
know,
so it got all his sins out in the open.

1398
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,820
Then they had a big ceremony with the,
like the statues of the gods.

1399
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:38,190
They replayed the battle between Marta 
can tie a math and then they.

1400
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,930
There was some other things that 
happened to which I won't get into,

1401
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,093
but then the.
Then they went back inside and the new 

1402
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,400
year was renewed,
so they acted out the the eternal battle

1403
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:53,401
between attention say and embodied 
detention and chaos,

1404
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,430
and they realized that reverence for 
that was the was the,

1405
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,990
was the basis for valid authority,
valid authority,

1406
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,920
and the king had a moral obligation to 
act in that manner.

1407
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,770
That's why he got two,
became like brilliant.

1408
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,040
Now

1409
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,551
you say,
well,

1410
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:14,840
are they conscious of this?
They're conscious enough to act it out,

1411
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,990
right?
That's as conscious as they were,

1412
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:18,824
they could use their bodies and their 
collective as a representational 

1413
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:25,040
mechanism,
but they couldn't,

1414
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,083
you know,
and then they could tell stories about 

1415
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:27,554
it too,
but as far as deriving out what that 

1416
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:34,460
meant philosophically and in a fully 
articulated way,

1417
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,570
it's like,
no,

1418
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,463
they couldn't do that,

1419
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,260
which is fascinating for me.
So what that does,

1420
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,990
at least in my interpretation of what 
you're saying,

1421
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,940
is that religious systems that are often
derided by,

1422
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,550
let's say a mentor post enlightenment 
thinkers for their,

1423
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,433
um,
for axioms that are just not true or 

1424
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,290
false about the world,
right?

1425
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,380
That's religious superstition.
It's clearly wrong.

1426
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,820
It's backwards.
What you're saying is they were there,

1427
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,173
they were and are very much true in the 
sense that they are almost preconscious 

1428
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,440
representations of correct action

1429
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,580
and the environment in which correct 
action takes place,

1430
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,710
which is fundamentally the dominance 
hierarchy,

1431
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,450
right?
We don't contend with protons and Adams,

1432
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:28,480
we contend mostly with other people and 
to some degree we contend with nature,

1433
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,720
right?
But nature is sort of outside our proper

1434
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:33,000
domain,
right?

1435
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:33,843
That's partly why that idea infuses 
environmentalism or it's like we've got 

1436
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,250
environmental ism is mythology,
right?

1437
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:42,280
To the core.
It's like pure mother nature.

1438
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:43,930
She's a virgin,
right?

1439
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:47,980
And she's being raped by the terrible 
father and the son,

1440
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:49,540
his evil sons.
It's like,

1441
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,140
yeah,
yeah,

1442
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:50,973
true.
But what about the good father and his 

1443
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:56,150
good sons and cancer and you know,
um,

1444
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,913
well there was this horrible worm in 
Africa that used to burrow inside 

1445
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:01,900
people's skin.
Yeah,

1446
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:03,950
it's horrible.
And it was just eradicated day.

1447
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:07,600
So some doctor took it upon himself to 
get rid of that worm.

1448
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,441
It's like,
yeah,

1449
01:19:08,441 --> 01:19:10,150
well that's mother nature to,
you know.

1450
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,140
So Environmental Islam is an ideology 
because it only tells half the story.

1451
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,420
Of course people are patients and 
horrible,

1452
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,703
you know,
and Mother Nature is beautiful and 

1453
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:19,391
virginal.
It's like,

1454
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:20,050
yeah,
yeah,

1455
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:25,050
but she's also an absolute terror and 
you better be thankful for the fact that

1456
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:30,160
you have a roof over your head and that 
everybody isn't an adversarial rapist.

1457
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,233
So you know,
you better balance out the story a 

1458
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:33,850
little bit.
So the,

1459
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,773
the stories tell you how to act,
but they also tell you what the 

1460
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,180
environment is.
No,

1461
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:45,990
not environment.
They tell you how to conceptualize.

1462
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:48,970
They.
They modeled the nature of being.

1463
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,340
That's the best way of thinking about an
actual b,

1464
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,413
and in being is the social world.
How do you act in relationship to the 

1465
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,950
social world?
Let me tell you.

1466
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:01,580
Oh yeah,
isn't that what you're saying?

1467
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:02,414
Is isn't that different mythologies at 
different points in time will tell you 

1468
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,373
how to act under particular conditions 
in which that and wish that society 

1469
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,683
developed?

1470
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,330
No,
no.

1471
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,800
It's broader than that.
It's broad.

1472
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:15,730
It's broad.
Well,

1473
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,740
look,
I understood once who said,

1474
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,900
well,
if these archetypes are true,

1475
01:20:19,901 --> 01:20:22,660
why don't we just tell the architectural
story over and over,

1476
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,720
why do we need like literature?
And I thought,

1477
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,980
wow,
that's a really good question.

1478
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,870
And then I thought,
well,

1479
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:32,110
for much of human history we just told 
the archetypal story over and over.

1480
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,363
Okay.
So,

1481
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:34,443
but then there's this tension.
So this is why I think that there's 

1482
01:20:37,181 --> 01:20:40,410
three persons in the Christian Trinity.
It's like there's,

1483
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,730
there's the Holy Ghost will just forget 
about him for a minute,

1484
01:20:42,731 --> 01:20:45,130
but there's God the father that needs no
explanation.

1485
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:45,700
That's,
you know,

1486
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,980
the benevolent element,
benevolent.

1487
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:51,010
That's the great father.
And then there's the sun.

1488
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:52,540
That's the hero.
Okay.

1489
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:53,374
But the hero is weird because there's 
this sort of logos hero that's been 

1490
01:20:57,011 --> 01:20:58,980
there since the beginning of time.
That's logos,

1491
01:20:58,990 --> 01:20:59,890
right?
That's the word.

1492
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,170
And then there's Jesus Christ,
the carpenter,

1493
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,270
he's this guy that lived in,
you know,

1494
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:09,271
some little bitty irrelevant village 
2000 years ago and died young.

1495
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,133
Why do you need him?
While it's because the universal isn't 

1496
01:21:14,351 --> 01:21:18,050
real until it's been made.
Particular and what we are.

1497
01:21:18,051 --> 01:21:18,884
Our particular manifestations of the 
universal and the particular and the 

1498
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:25,900
universal are both important.
So the general pattern is crucial,

1499
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,970
but so are the details.
So,

1500
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,930
so the archetype is a general pattern,
you know,

1501
01:21:31,931 --> 01:21:32,764
it's not,
you have your religious task in a sense 

1502
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:40,240
is to figure out how to embody the 
archetype in actual time and space.

1503
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:41,760
So it's a pattern,
but,

1504
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:42,723
but you know,
you still have to fill in the details 

1505
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:46,840
and it's not like the details are 
irrelevant.

1506
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:47,674
They're really irrelevant details 
culturally and temporarily specific in 

1507
01:21:50,941 --> 01:21:51,551
some cases.
Yeah,

1508
01:21:51,551 --> 01:21:52,500
sure,
sure.

1509
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,260
Let's say that's why we have Christ in 
the Christian tradition,

1510
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:57,820
but we have put in the Buddhist 
tradition,

1511
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:58,893
the Hindu tradition has its own plethora
with its own embodiments of universal 

1512
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:05,780
truth versus individual app.
My,

1513
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,053
I mean,
because the va case you make for the 

1514
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:10,474
power of the,
let's say the Christian archetype 

1515
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,210
narrative is most familiar to us in the 
West,

1516
01:22:13,211 --> 01:22:15,580
whether it's Georgia or otherwise

1517
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:19,840
or while I also think that Christianity 
has the best,

1518
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,530
the most thoroughly developed philosophy
of evil.

1519
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,820
So I think that's a big advantage.
So,

1520
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,080
um,
but yeah,

1521
01:22:29,081 --> 01:22:29,914
I mean if you think about religions as 
at least in part variations of hero 

1522
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:35,110
mythology,
which they are in part,

1523
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,180
then it,
it's a story that can be told a thousand

1524
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:41,680
times in a thousand ways.
I mean,

1525
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:43,870
that's what a movie is.
If it's an adventure movie,

1526
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,090
it's always a hero myth of some sort.
I mean,

1527
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,253
Christ,
they're the ones we have now are almost 

1528
01:22:48,761 --> 01:22:51,730
purely archetipal,
like all the superhero movies,

1529
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:53,920
those are architectural right to the 
core.

1530
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:55,323
You know,
and it's funny because I know a comic 

1531
01:22:56,741 --> 01:22:57,574
book artists or author,
he writes Batman and Wolverine and 

1532
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:06,250
there's a community that the

1533
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,660
comic figure serves.
So if it's Batman and you're writing for

1534
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,494
Batman,
you don't just get to do anything with 

1535
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:13,894
Batman.
There are Batman rules and the whole 

1536
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:18,400
community of Batman fans,
they know the rules.

1537
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,160
And so if you muck about with Batman,
then they tell you.

1538
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:25,900
So Batman is actually an archetype 
that's been generated by the collective.

1539
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,970
Right?
And they all feel,

1540
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:29,470
well,
that's not quite right.

1541
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,060
Well,
how,

1542
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:33,550
why do you feel that the story isn't 
quite right?

1543
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,720
Well,
the answer to that,

1544
01:23:34,721 --> 01:23:37,390
it's like a platonic answers.
You know the story.

1545
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,310
You just don't know that you know the 
story.

1546
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,740
And so when someone tells you the story 
properly,

1547
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:42,371
you think,
wow,

1548
01:23:42,371 --> 01:23:45,730
that's the story.
It's like lock in lock key and lock,

1549
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,750
which is fascinating.
Is your argument bend?

1550
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:52,970
We know it's right when we see it 
because it's so ancient and.

1551
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,270
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1552
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,131
Yeah,
that.

1553
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:58,450
And that's the other thing.
So there's.

1554
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:03,250
Piaget had this idea of a equilibration 
man,

1555
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:05,950
it's a smart idea because piaget,
I don't know if you know this or not,

1556
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:06,784
but the motivation,
Piaget's motivation was to bridge the 

1557
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:10,384
gap between science and religion and he 
had very intense messianic experiences 

1558
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:14,860
when he was a young man.
Yeah.

1559
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:15,694
Yeah.
So no one ever teaches that about 

1560
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:17,224
piaget.
Piaget is way more interesting than you 

1561
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:19,564
think.
The FDA was very interested in the 

1562
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:21,424
origin of morality and he traced the 
origin morality back in some sense to 

1563
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:30,160
the rules that govern social 
interactions.

1564
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,450
Okay.
So you can think.

1565
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,053
Piaget thought it really got going once 
kids were able to play games with each 

1566
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:40,430
other that had a shared goal.
Okay.

1567
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,670
So that was kind of Piaget's definition 
of a gate.

1568
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,913
It's like there's a bunch of people 
cooperating and competing in 

1569
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,660
relationship to a mutually agreed upon 
goal.

1570
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,550
So like a monopoly game,
you know,

1571
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:53,290
you want to get all the money.
It's like why?

1572
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,660
Because everyone agrees that that's what
we're doing,

1573
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,960
so it's like that's an artificial 
dominance hierarchy.

1574
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:01,720
We just whipped it up on the fly.
Here's the top value,

1575
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,913
we'll play it out,
so then we're playing with his kind of 

1576
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,470
dominance hierarchy,
right?

1577
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,420
You get all sorts of information about 
people doing that and you also know,

1578
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:10,423
clue yourself into the nature of 
dominance hierarchies in the way that 

1579
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:16,510
they can be constructed even somewhat 
arbitrarily.

1580
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:17,763
Now,
what piaget noted was that children 

1581
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:24,961
could play together and they could get 
along and they could pursue the goal,

1582
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,780
but if you took them out when they were 
young,

1583
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:31,150
out of the context and you ask them what
the rules were,

1584
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:32,283
well they didn't know because the rules 
were actually the behavioral patterns 

1585
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,390
that all the kids had agreed upon.

1586
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,890
One way or another.
They.

1587
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,220
They didn't sit down and codify the 
rules and then act them out.

1588
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,290
They acted out a coherent action 
pattern,

1589
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:52,960
and then when polled from that,
they couldn't articulate it.

1590
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:56,350
That wasn't the level at which the 
knowledge was embodied.

1591
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,810
Well,
that's.

1592
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,400
That's exactly what happened to us 
across the course of history.

1593
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:05,300
It's like we learned to act before we 
learned the rules for how we acted.

1594
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,090
It's exactly the opposite of a 
rationalist perspective,

1595
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:08,924
by the way,
and nature was the first person to 

1596
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:11,760
really point this out.
You know,

1597
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,840
he said that a philosophical of 
philosophy is the unconscious confession

1598
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:17,804
of a philosopher,
so in here you can think about this in 

1599
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:25,571
terms of of the story of Moses to.
It's like Moses realizes the rules,

1600
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:26,930
right?
Because God gives them to him.

1601
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:29,810
Well,
before Moses gets the rules,

1602
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:35,110
he spends like years in the desert as 
judge,

1603
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:36,973
like all the Israelites who were always 
scrapping with each other that get into 

1604
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:40,370
a fight.
They come to him and say,

1605
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:41,780
okay,
who's right here?

1606
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:46,490
And he's doing like all day for years 
adjudicating.

1607
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,100
So his mind is assembling all of these

1608
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:56,720
instances of moral conflict and he 
couldn't recognize patterns.

1609
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,003
Well,
one day it's like it's a blinding flash 

1610
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:01,440
of illumination.
It's like,

1611
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:02,274
oh,
these are the rules that we're 

1612
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:05,124
following.
It's the translation of the behavioral 

1613
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:07,464
knowledge into abstraction.
Now you know Moses is a composite 

1614
01:27:10,321 --> 01:27:11,154
character,
although there are many stories about 

1615
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,530
the original law giver.
It's not the original law giver,

1616
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:21,710
it's the original law observer.
Like we're our own wolf pack.

1617
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,633
We're we're an anthropologist or or 
ethnologist and wolf pack at the same 

1618
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:27,150
time,
oh,

1619
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:31,620
here we are doing things.
What are we doing while we watch?

1620
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,290
And we make stories out of it.
This is what we seem to be doing.

1621
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,260
What are the stories mean?
This is what they seem to mean.

1622
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,920
Oh,
those are.

1623
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,753
Those are those rules.
They're articulated descriptions of 

1624
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:44,250
behavioral patterns.
We must be following them.

1625
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,500
It's like,
well now we're following them because we

1626
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:47,430
know what the rules are.

1627
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:51,840
Before we were just acting out the 
equivalent embodied pattern.

1628
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:53,491
So,
and you know,

1629
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:56,760
the like the conspiracy theorists,
you know,

1630
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:57,780
the people who say,
well,

1631
01:27:57,781 --> 01:27:58,614
you know,
this is all about control by the upper 

1632
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:00,474
classes.
It's like they assume that you can just 

1633
01:28:02,191 --> 01:28:03,024
generate up some arbitrary rules that 
happen to serve you and then enforce 

1634
01:28:05,761 --> 01:28:06,780
them on a community.
It's,

1635
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,550
well,
no,

1636
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:12,350
partly,
but fundamentally no.

1637
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,820
You know,
because that,

1638
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,350
that's not,
that's not biological thinking.

1639
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,653
You know,
that's dawn of the industrial age 

1640
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:22,200
thinking or something like that.
Or post agricultural thinking.

1641
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:24,250
Who cares about that,
you know?

1642
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:25,084
Well,
let's go back to when we lived in trees 

1643
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:27,444
will go back 60 million years and start 
talking about who we are from that 

1644
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:35,100
perspective and that's just the start.
We're older than that,

1645
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,830
so it just.
It's too.

1646
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:43,280
It's way too narrow a view.
It's not informed by biological reality.

1647
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:48,150
When you mentioned the Moses story as 
logged giver versus Law Observer,

1648
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,583
and then I was thinking of the actual 
biblical story of where God speaks to 

1649
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:53,994
Moses.
Then my introductions are my inner 

1650
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,160
enlightenment saying,
okay,

1651
01:28:59,161 --> 01:29:02,100
all well and good,
but why do you this ridiculous

1652
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,360
sky figure who is a representation of 
the dominance hierarchy?

1653
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,220
That's the father.
It's like,

1654
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,430
why not?
Okay that.

1655
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:13,530
Let's talk about that.
What is it?

1656
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,840
Agency detection module.
Okay.

1657
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,740
First of all,
that's a stupid way to conceptualize it.

1658
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,833
It is not an agency detection module.
It's not some little gadget that stuck 

1659
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:26,880
to a computer.
It's really deep.

1660
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,860
Okay,
so let's think about who we are.

1661
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,920
Monkeys.
Where do we live in a dominance?

1662
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,754
Herc,
what's a permanent element of the 

1663
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:37,170
dominant Turkey?
The dominance hierarchy.

1664
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,000
What else?
Well,

1665
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,810
males,
females and you.

1666
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:44,363
Okay,
so we're going to say what's the world 

1667
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:48,510
made out of males,
females,

1668
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,290
and you.
Why is the world made out of that?

1669
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,260
Because no matter where you go,
no matter when,

1670
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:59,670
no matter how far back in time,
those are things you can rely on.

1671
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,710
So then,
so now we have this circuit,

1672
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:02,940
it's the brain.

1673
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:03,871
It's like,
well,

1674
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:04,704
what are males like?
What are females like and what are we 

1675
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:10,170
like and how do we interact?
Okay,

1676
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,510
so there you get the constituent 
elements of reality.

1677
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,190
So first of all,
it's just social,

1678
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,113
but it's complex because the males are 
just singular figures like the father 

1679
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:20,783
isn't an individual.
The father is the whole patriarchal 

1680
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,710
dominance hierarchy,
right?

1681
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:28,560
The individuals,
just a representation of that.

1682
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,800
So our minds are more evolved to 
consider masculinity as such rather than

1683
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:34,944
the male individual,
you would say of Freud's problem 

1684
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:42,030
patients that they confuse their own 
fathers with the masculine.

1685
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,940
The masculine is like a God.
You say,

1686
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:45,840
well,
is it a god?

1687
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,591
It's like,
well,

1688
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:49,950
it shapes your behavior.
It determines your destiny.

1689
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,650
It determines your,
your fitness.

1690
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,830
Is it alive?
That's a good question.

1691
01:30:56,670 --> 01:31:00,780
It depends on how you describe alive.
So okay,

1692
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:03,060
so we've,
we've got this system that can recognize

1693
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:06,870
like the masculine living thing,
the feminine living thing,

1694
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:08,670
the self living thing.

1695
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:14,030
Well that's the underlying priest sobbed
presuppositions of our nervous system.

1696
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:16,650
That's the world of being.
Okay.

1697
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:21,210
At some point our cortex inflates,
so now we can use abstraction,

1698
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,390
but you know that evolution is a 
conservative process.

1699
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,710
You don't just build a new thing,
you call,

1700
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,583
you build a new thing on an old thing 
and so the new thing still thinks like 

1701
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:34,080
the old thing,
but it can do some more things.

1702
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:35,400
Well,
so what's happened,

1703
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,103
what's happened to us,
and this is something that's amazing to 

1704
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:40,164
me,
is that we've taken these basic social 

1705
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:42,504
cognitive categories and we've been able
to map being itself using the same 

1706
01:31:47,551 --> 01:31:49,380
categories.
And it works.

1707
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:53,400
You've mapped the masculine onto the 
dominance hierarchy.

1708
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:58,580
Umass Mac map the feminine onto nature.
Well that works.

1709
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,090
All of a sudden that works.
It's like you can,

1710
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:03,010
you can survive like that.
So you think,

1711
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:04,000
well,
is that a metaphor?

1712
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,260
It's like,
no,

1713
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:07,750
it's not a metaphor.
Here's an example,

1714
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,320
why is mother nature,
Mother Nature?

1715
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,340
What's nature?
Well,

1716
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:19,350
nature is that which selects.
That's as far as I can tell you Carl.

1717
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:21,520
So you're going to define nature.
Nature.

1718
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:24,040
Select women select.

1719
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,940
I mean that's what women do.
Who?

1720
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,980
Human women,
they're not like chimps.

1721
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,353
They're selective maters,
so as far as men are concerned that 

1722
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:35,940
maybe as far as women are concerned to 
women,

1723
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,860
our nature,
it's not a metaphor.

1724
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:39,683
It's like they're there.
The thing that stops you from 

1725
01:32:41,821 --> 01:32:43,470
reproducing,
let's say,

1726
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:45,540
and that's partly why they make you self
conscious.

1727
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:46,374
When you rejected,
it's like they're the portal to 

1728
01:32:48,631 --> 01:32:50,730
immortality.
That's another way of looking at it.

1729
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,060
They are nature.
It's not like they represented.

1730
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:57,330
They are nature in the most direct 
possible way.

1731
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,630
So like is that a right way of looking 
at the world?

1732
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,900
Too difficult to make an alternative 
case?

1733
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:05,730
If you think from a Darwinian 
perspective,

1734
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,593
now there's a metaphorical element to it
too because you can also projected on 

1735
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:13,380
that which lies outside of the 
patriarchy,

1736
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,513
which is also white.
Women get in trouble with men sometimes 

1737
01:33:16,111 --> 01:33:18,840
because men can easily get confused,
right?

1738
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,943
It's easy for women to be the chaotic 
thing that doesn't fit in the hierarchy 

1739
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:24,300
and women are always complaining about 
that.

1740
01:33:24,301 --> 01:33:26,070
Right,
and and as they should,

1741
01:33:26,071 --> 01:33:30,000
it's a constant battle,
but what's happened for,

1742
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:31,043
for better or worse,
is that we've been able to take that 

1743
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:33,564
initial social cognitive architecture to
build a system of abstraction on top of 

1744
01:33:37,591 --> 01:33:42,591
that to use the same basic categories to
explain how to behave and it worked.

1745
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:46,770
So it's mind boggling.
It's mind boggling to me that,

1746
01:33:46,771 --> 01:33:47,604
that works.

1747
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,500
So are you familiar with the theories of
embodied cognition and like,

1748
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:56,501
and I'm like George Lake off in his,
his metaphor theory of thought.

1749
01:33:58,410 --> 01:33:59,243
Sure.
I think what you're saying is the same 

1750
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:01,581
thing,
right?

1751
01:34:01,581 --> 01:34:02,414
We have these categories that emerged 
from our lived experience as humans in 

1752
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:07,990
our human.
Sure.

1753
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,781
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1754
01:34:08,781 --> 01:34:09,614
Yeah.
And because these are actually the only 

1755
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:11,894
tools we have,
we use them in recombination with each 

1756
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:18,590
other with themselves if nif necessarily
modification,

1757
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:21,920
but we use them as ways of making sense 
of the world.

1758
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:25,690
Even our scientific models are 
predicated on the,

1759
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,070
the embodied experiences.

1760
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:28,440
Yeah.
Well that's a tough one.

1761
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,830
That's a tougher one because I do think 
that there's.

1762
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:35,690
The science does have a qualitative,
there's a qualitative difference.

1763
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,350
It is in some sense stepping outside of 
the mythological framework,

1764
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:40,663
you know,
and it's because it's this really 

1765
01:34:41,961 --> 01:34:43,790
powerful technique.
It's like,

1766
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:44,624
okay,
what is the nature of our shared 

1767
01:34:46,401 --> 01:34:47,920
experience?
Now it's,

1768
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,793
it's.
That's not exactly what science is 

1769
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:50,624
about.
It's more like if we behave in such and 

1770
01:34:52,631 --> 01:34:54,590
such a way something will happen.

1771
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,020
We're going to that from a subjective 
perspective,

1772
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:04,520
like a personal perspective let's say,
but what happens if we get 100 people to

1773
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:05,354
do that and they all observe the outcome
and then they all tell a story about it 

1774
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:11,990
and then we take what's common across 
the stories.

1775
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,123
It's like,

1776
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:13,963
oh,

1777
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:18,560
well that's interesting.
We get a new way of describing things.

1778
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,850
Well,
is that true?

1779
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:27,890
Well then you get back into the problem 
of what constitutes truth.

1780
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,040
Is it useful that we also don't know 
that because we don't have the timeframe

1781
01:35:33,681 --> 01:35:34,514
across which to analyze it yet.
Like we're staking our survival on the 

1782
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:43,510
presupposition that it's useful,
but it's like there wouldn't be constant

1783
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:47,570
bouts of apocalyptic thinking if we 
didn't have our doubts about it.

1784
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:48,853
Right.
And it's certainly an anomaly in the 

1785
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:53,300
natural world,
while no one,

1786
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:54,163
no other creature has science.
It's like they did perfectly well 

1787
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:58,100
without it.
Maybe science is fatal.

1788
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,470
I mean it could easily be fatal.
So you know,

1789
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:03,920
and,
and,

1790
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,920
and someone who's a scientist in that 
sort of ideological sense would say,

1791
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:11,810
well,
even if it's fatal,

1792
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:13,190
it was still true.
It's like,

1793
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,950
well,
it depends on how you define truth.

1794
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:21,220
Like if you're willing to say that fatal
is true,

1795
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:23,143
well then go ahead.
But I think that's a not a good 

1796
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:25,334
definition of truth.
And that's where are our disagreement 

1797
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:28,244
really lies.
You have your definition now I have my 

1798
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:32,870
definition.
I think my definition is Darwinian.

1799
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:36,350
So you have to contend with that if 
you're a scientist,

1800
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,573
but you might dispute that,
although it's not clear to me how you 

1801
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:41,870
would dispute that,
but.

1802
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,870
Well we've already run through that 
argument.

1803
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:46,730
He'd gets tangled up at the bottom.
You know,

1804
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:47,743
and I also think part of the problem 
with strictly with the view that only 

1805
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:53,564
what is objective observable is real,
which you can have a science without 

1806
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:00,470
that presupposition.
You could say only what is,

1807
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:04,310
what is objectively true is uniquely 
useful and valuable,

1808
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,511
but it's,
you know,

1809
01:37:05,511 --> 01:37:08,120
it's part of a bunch of things that are 
uniquely useful.

1810
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,100
Invaluable.
But let's not discounted.

1811
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,620
It's also dangerous.
So we got to keep an eye on it.

1812
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:14,300
You know,
it's a big tool.

1813
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:17,300
Well,
that's perfectly reasonable thing to do.

1814
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,213
What do you,
you take the next step and you say only 

1815
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:23,000
that.
Well then I also think another way.

1816
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,860
It's like,
why are you claiming only that?

1817
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:26,540
You say,
well,

1818
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:29,420
it's because I'm pursuing truth and I 
think,

1819
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,030
Oh,
you're sure about that are you.

1820
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,280
You actually think that like you're on 
this,

1821
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,173
you're sure that you're on this pristine
path and all those other people who 

1822
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:40,214
aren't there,
they're diluted or there's something 

1823
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:43,100
wrong with them,
but you,

1824
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:46,280
you're on this pristine path.
You're so sure of that.

1825
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,440
I don't think you know anything about 
yourself.

1826
01:37:48,441 --> 01:37:53,441
If you think that it's like all 
scientists are devoted to the truth,

1827
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:55,940
what truth,
like

1828
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,000
maybe they're devoted to the purpose of 
demonstrating that there's no meaning in

1829
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,970
life so that they don't have to bear any
moral responsibility.

1830
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:04,740
It's like,
why not that,

1831
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,150
oh,
we wouldn't think that.

1832
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,721
It's like,
well,

1833
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:07,554
I'm a psychoanalyst.
I might think that because whenever 

1834
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:12,300
anybody says to me,
I believe x,

1835
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,223
I think,

1836
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,080
what does it allow you not to believe 
I'm for x.

1837
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:20,820
What are you against?
Well,

1838
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,560
I've thought about this a lot.
It's like,

1839
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,900
oh,
it's a catastrophe that the,

1840
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,650
the war between science and religion 
blows the,

1841
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,753
our capacity to believe in transcendent,
meaning it demolishes our ability to 

1842
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:35,670
believe in transcendent meaning.
Isn't that a catastrophe?

1843
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:36,553
Sort of the Nietzschean viewpoint.
It's like I don't know if it's a 

1844
01:38:40,201 --> 01:38:42,030
catastrophe because then I think,
alright,

1845
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:46,650
well under what conditions would you be 
motivated to accept that catastrophe?

1846
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:50,220
Well,
you could say your life is meaningful,

1847
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:56,330
but meaning comes at a price.
The price is basically moral and part of

1848
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:59,250
that moral price is truth and 
responsibility.

1849
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:02,710
You have to bear that.
Okay.

1850
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:03,341
It's like,
yeah,

1851
01:39:03,341 --> 01:39:06,100
you get meaning,
but now we've got some work to do.

1852
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:08,770
You don't get to regard your actions as 
trivial.

1853
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:09,783
You don't get to rationalize your,
your errors of speech as as casual and 

1854
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,390
and a forgivable.
None of that.

1855
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:20,050
You get the whole burden that goes with 
meaning or you can say,

1856
01:39:20,051 --> 01:39:21,070
well,
nothing's meaningful.

1857
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,083
Well,
Dostoevsky figured this out a long time 

1858
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:25,660
ago.
If there's no god,

1859
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,690
there's no moral values.
Everything is permitted.

1860
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:29,591
It's like,
okay,

1861
01:39:29,591 --> 01:39:33,490
maybe that's what you want.
Maybe your whole argument,

1862
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:34,803
even though you don't know it.
Maybe that whole argument of which 

1863
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:43,090
you're only a part of is actually 
predicated on the desire to demolish the

1864
01:39:43,571 --> 01:39:47,650
necessity for truth and responsibility.
So what you could say no.

1865
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,610
It's like,
okay,

1866
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:49,443
but you know,
it's not like science has always been 

1867
01:39:51,641 --> 01:39:55,030
put to two purposes that we would regard
as ethical.

1868
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:57,070
And then you also have to ask,
well,

1869
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:58,743
what allows us to ask the question of 
whether or not sciences put the ethical 

1870
01:40:01,421 --> 01:40:04,540
purposes?
What's the framework for evaluation?

1871
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:06,820
What's not scientific?
Well,

1872
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:07,663
does it exist?
Soldier Nets and said something 

1873
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:11,944
interesting about the Nuremberg judgment
because he thought of that is like a 

1874
01:40:14,411 --> 01:40:17,190
pinnacle event in the 20th century and 
it,

1875
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,060
I,
I can understand this because

1876
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:23,241
like,
you know,

1877
01:40:23,241 --> 01:40:24,074
there was this Cartesian,
one of the things they cart did 

1878
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:27,013
hypothetically was to try to doubt 
everything until he found something he 

1879
01:40:28,851 --> 01:40:31,570
couldn't doubt and what he couldn't do 
it was the fact that he,

1880
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:34,130
he thinks now that's a,
that's a translation.

1881
01:40:34,131 --> 01:40:37,310
So I don't really know if he met.
I think whatever.

1882
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,730
He had this process of radical doubt.
Well,

1883
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,950
I did that too before I wrote maps of 
meaning,

1884
01:40:42,951 --> 01:40:44,660
except I didn't know that descartes had 
done it.

1885
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,240
I was trying to think,
what do,

1886
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:48,290
what do I actually believe?
What's,

1887
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:53,291
what's unassailably true for me?
And I thought pain pain's

1888
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,930
true.
It's really hard.

1889
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,720
You can't argue yourself out of pain.
It's like when it happens,

1890
01:40:58,810 --> 01:40:59,650
it's real.
It.

1891
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,830
No matter what you say about 
subjectivity,

1892
01:41:01,831 --> 01:41:03,070
it's like you're running around 
screaming,

1893
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:05,530
so who cares what you say?
Now I thought,

1894
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:10,531
well the infliction of pain is real,
and then I thought well,

1895
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:15,520
if and pain is pain is unpleasant,
it's got that quality about it,

1896
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,081
you know,
and I,

1897
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:18,430
I,
so that was good.

1898
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:19,264
And then there was another process of 
argumentation that led me to conclude 

1899
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:23,044
that what constitutes a evil was the 
infliction of unnecessary pain and for 

1900
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:31,810
me like so not only like if I'm really 
evil,

1901
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,620
I'm going to inflict pain in a way that 
not only damages whoever I'm inflicting,

1902
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:36,543
it also damages me and that's fine.
It's like the shootings and the high 

1903
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:40,774
schools.
It's like,

1904
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:43,180
why don't they just shoot themselves to 
begin with?

1905
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,640
Why go to all the trouble?
Well,

1906
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,013
try answering that.
You should read some of the writings of 

1907
01:41:49,091 --> 01:41:50,380
the columbine killers,
man.

1908
01:41:50,381 --> 01:41:52,360
They'll make the hair on the back of 
your neck.

1909
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:53,770
Stand up.
You know,

1910
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,613
it's,
you cannot believe what those kids 

1911
01:41:56,201 --> 01:41:56,980
wrote.
It's,

1912
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:01,450
it's uncanny what they were thinking 
truly so.

1913
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,580
Well,
they're motivated by something.

1914
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:04,720
What,
what,

1915
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,690
while it's something say panic from an 
architectural perspective,

1916
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,280
you know,
so for me,

1917
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,183
what ended up at the bottom of reality 
was it's wrong to inflict unnecessary 

1918
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,490
pain.
So pain even that's,

1919
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:19,420
that's,
that doesn't serve your own purposes.

1920
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:24,160
Even that's the Nuremberg judgment.
Fundamentally it's like there are things

1921
01:42:24,161 --> 01:42:25,780
that are wrong.
Okay,

1922
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:30,000
are you going to accept that or not?
Well,

1923
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:34,600
if you accept that there's a place you 
go and if you don't accept that there is

1924
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:35,434
another place you go.
And we already saw what happened when 

1925
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:40,600
people go to that place and so you can 
say,

1926
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:44,500
well that's irrelevant.

1927
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:49,270
Okay fine.
You pay the price for your belief.

1928
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,780
So will other people.
So for you know,

1929
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:53,643
so that's why soldier and it's was at 
least in part an admirer of the 

1930
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:56,674
Nuremberg judgment.
So like there are things that are 

1931
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,293
archetypally evil.
You don't get to his escape from them 

1932
01:43:04,121 --> 01:43:04,954
because of culture.
You don't get to escape from them 

1933
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,760
because of the particulars of the 
situation.

1934
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:13,750
Well,
you could make a strong case that that's

1935
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,830
victor talk and revenge.
Fair enough.

1936
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:18,843
But when I wandered through the 
Holocaust literature and the literature 

1937
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:28,291
on the Japanese invasion of China and 
the literature on the stalinists camps,

1938
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,410
that was sufficiently convincing for me,
it's like,

1939
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,960
no,
not there.

1940
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:38,650
That's not the right place to go.
Is that a scientific judgment?

1941
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:43,510
No.
You're judging from your own logic.

1942
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:49,620
Interesting that your judgment is 
predicated on your existence as a human,

1943
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,340
a dominance hierarchy,

1944
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,173
and that's what makes that judgment of 
the fact that this sort of behavior is 

1945
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,620
wrong.
True.

1946
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,170
Because of the biological context almost
sure.

1947
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,380
Which sure.

1948
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:03,383
Which is embedded.
It's more than that because as an 

1949
01:44:07,621 --> 01:44:10,110
individual I'm an individual,
but as a human,

1950
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:13,500
I'm not an individual at all.
I'm this unbelievably old thing.

1951
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:14,873
I'm like as old as life.
I'm really old while there's the me in 

1952
01:44:19,081 --> 01:44:21,660
this,
which is this thing that was like,

1953
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:22,523
come around in 1962,
but there's the deeper reality of this 

1954
01:44:26,401 --> 01:44:28,880
thing that I am.
And that's the.

1955
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:30,870
You could say,
well that's the union itself.

1956
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,890
That's one way of looking at it,
but it has its nature.

1957
01:44:35,490 --> 01:44:39,030
It's the human nature,
not what good and evil are human terms.

1958
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:39,953
You know,
now whether they refer to something 

1959
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:43,290
transcendent,
that's a whole different question.

1960
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,153
It is not a simple question because we 
don't know what rural consciousness 

1961
01:44:47,101 --> 01:44:47,934
plays in being so I,
I like the deepest strata of thought 

1962
01:44:53,941 --> 01:44:54,774
that I've encountered,
makes the case that the most real thing 

1963
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:02,310
is the eternal battle between good and 
evil and I'm prone to believe that.

1964
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:07,100
So what exactly that means.
That's a,

1965
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:09,980
that's a different story.
It's complicated idea to,

1966
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,833
to the.

1967
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,513
My inner list in my brain now is saying 
that that's a confusion of facts and 

1968
01:45:18,551 --> 01:45:19,410
values,
but what,

1969
01:45:19,411 --> 01:45:20,244
what I'm what I'm assuming that you 
would say back and correct me and tell 

1970
01:45:24,191 --> 01:45:28,030
me what you would say back even as a,
as a materialist scientist,

1971
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:32,140
you yourself are human participating in 
this human drama.

1972
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,760
You're better than one.

1973
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:35,803
Yes,
that's right.

1974
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,820
That's exactly right.
That's right.

1975
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,430
Because that's the question.
Objective reality,

1976
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,920
mythologies,
one,

1977
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:45,860
proposition,
mythology,

1978
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,740
objective reality,
another proposition.

1979
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:49,783
That's my proposition.
It's like this is way deeper than this 

1980
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,950
to its incomparably deeper.
Now that doesn't mean this is deep.

1981
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,900
It's deep,
but it's,

1982
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,640
it's,
it's sterile and that's dangerous.

1983
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:08,000
And then when you forget,
which is embedded in which then you make

1984
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:09,290
mistakes,
it's like,

1985
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:11,870
yeah,
well why not cross Ebola was smallpox.

1986
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,330
Well,
that's a good question.

1987
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:17,690
Why not do it?
Well,

1988
01:46:17,691 --> 01:46:19,730
you know,
a rationalist would say,

1989
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:20,960
well,
I'm,

1990
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,240
I'm capable of making that judgment.
Okay,

1991
01:46:23,241 --> 01:46:24,074
well let's really specify that.
What exactly do you mean that you're 

1992
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,370
capable of making that judgment?
Because again,

1993
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:31,250
with Dawkins and his ilk,
you know,

1994
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,700
they make the claim that they can have 
their cake and eat it too,

1995
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:37,460
is thinking of all the benefits of 
eating evolved morality,

1996
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:40,010
which is basically a Judeo Christian 
morality in the West.

1997
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,660
And they can say,
well yeah,

1998
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:44,390
but we don't have to accept any of the 
metaphysical presumptions.

1999
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:48,290
It's like says who like,
yeah,

2000
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:51,150
you could be right,
but why would you assume that you are.

2001
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,030
So maybe the metal.
This is niches point.

2002
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:57,060
Maybe the metaphysical presuppositions 
are absolutely necessary.

2003
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:58,730
So

2004
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,563
the question that is asked by the 
millennia old individuals or cultures 

2005
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:10,421
that gave birth to them or reinterpreted
as as preconscious symbology.

2006
01:47:11,690 --> 01:47:12,410
You see what I'm saying?

2007
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:12,890
No,
no,

2008
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:13,980
no,
not exactly.

2009
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:15,430
You have to specify that,

2010
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:17,050
right?
Because then Dawkins might say,

2011
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,430
or you know,
or I'll try not to pick on,

2012
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:26,250
but then the materialist positivist 
restrooms might say I'm okay,

2013
01:47:27,701 --> 01:47:31,420
but what does it mean to accept that 
mythology or to accept the metaphysics?

2014
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,570
Does it mean that I have to believe that
there's this omnipresent,

2015
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,250
um,
you know,

2016
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,180
uh,
a sadistic God who,

2017
01:47:39,181 --> 01:47:42,700
who pits nations against each other and,
and orders you to,

2018
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,470
you know,
to,

2019
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:48,010
to murder your,
that your neighboring tribe or rather is

2020
01:47:48,011 --> 01:47:48,844
it necessary to accept that metal,
those metaphysical to metaphysical 

2021
01:47:52,061 --> 01:47:53,890
background with the substrate,
if you will,

2022
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:57,060
in,
as understood now in,

2023
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:57,903
as I'm Persian symbolic imagery from a 
culture that had no other means of 

2024
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:06,130
articulating it so that [inaudible] then
they might say,

2025
01:48:06,131 --> 01:48:06,521
well,
sure,

2026
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:07,354
I can,
you know,

2027
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:10,300
I can accept that it had some value in 
its time and place.

2028
01:48:10,301 --> 01:48:11,470
But so

2029
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:12,700
no.
But okay.

2030
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,180
That's where I would,
that's where the problem would start for

2031
01:48:15,181 --> 01:48:17,520
me still that time and place,
you know,

2032
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:20,960
you get this idea too that like the 
evolutionary psychologists do this.

2033
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,090
Well.
Our evolutionary,

2034
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,470
where we evolved was the African Savanna
and you know,

2035
01:48:27,471 --> 01:48:29,810
our moral systems are adapted.
It's like why,

2036
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:30,921
why,
why?

2037
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:31,754
They're like,
why not in the oceans 300 million years 

2038
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:34,960
ago,
you know,

2039
01:48:34,961 --> 01:48:35,794
like when,
why is that the preferential place from 

2040
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:41,840
which our values are derived?
The rest of it's just nothing.

2041
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:43,430
It's like,
I don't understand.

2042
01:48:43,431 --> 01:48:45,380
That makes no sense to me at all.
Well,

2043
01:48:45,381 --> 01:48:48,260
you could say that's where we 
differentiated from chimps.

2044
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:48,951
It's like,
well,

2045
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:50,540
so what?
We're not that different from chimps.

2046
01:48:50,541 --> 01:48:52,790
So you know,
what about the chimps?

2047
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,830
They have a lot to share,
a lot in common with us.

2048
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:57,020
They didn't go through the SAVANNA.
It's like,

2049
01:48:57,050 --> 01:49:01,280
so the idea that these values say are 
shallow.

2050
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:02,143
I mean if you put it in an evolutionary 
basis and you go back to the African 

2051
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:06,500
Savannah,
well that's something.

2052
01:49:06,501 --> 01:49:06,861
It's a,
you know,

2053
01:49:06,861 --> 01:49:07,694
a few million years anyways,
but to me that's still icing on the 

2054
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:12,530
cake.
It's not deep enough.

2055
01:49:12,531 --> 01:49:15,110
This is way deeper now.
The metaphysics.

2056
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:17,450
Okay,
well let's talk about the metaphysics.

2057
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:18,980
Okay.
Who's idea of God?

2058
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:19,843
Are you talking about?
It's like it's got an old man with a 

2059
01:49:22,071 --> 01:49:24,620
beard and he lives in the sky.
Okay,

2060
01:49:24,621 --> 01:49:26,930
well let's take that argument apart a 
little bit.

2061
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:27,891
Okay.
First of all,

2062
01:49:27,891 --> 01:49:28,724
the ancient Jews,
they didn't like you to say the name of 

2063
01:49:30,291 --> 01:49:31,370
God.
Why?

2064
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:34,790
Because they didn't want you to confuse 
the representation with the phenomena,

2065
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:38,720
so whatever was real for them was 
something beyond words.

2066
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:39,703
Okay?
The same thing obtains with the Dow is 

2067
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:46,310
the same idea,
right?

2068
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:47,970
Don't make a image because

2069
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,630
you confuse the damn image with the 
thing.

2070
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:50,493
What's the thing?
It's that which is beyond the imaging 

2071
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:56,650
does that which beyond is beyond imaging
exist obviously.

2072
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,020
What's its nature?
Well,

2073
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:02,200
that's a different question.
Now in the Old Testament,

2074
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:04,960
it's nature is arbitrary and it's like,
look,

2075
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:07,390
the hell out.
You're going to get swatted down.

2076
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,493
But if you look carefully at the 
structure of the Old Testament and 

2077
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:14,470
northrop Frye did this,
fries argument was basically this,

2078
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:15,880
well,
you've got the really old stories.

2079
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:16,714
Forget about that.
History starts basically with Abraham 

2080
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:23,800
was the old testament about the 
Israelites climb up to dominance.

2081
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:24,783
They get corrupt,
they forget about the widows and the 

2082
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:27,190
children.
God,

2083
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,410
a prophet comes up and says,
you better look out.

2084
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,660
You're off the path.
They ignore him.

2085
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,960
WHAP,
they're in chaos for a long time.

2086
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:36,373
They get all humble and they build 
themselves up again and when they get 

2087
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:41,050
power,
they get all corrupt and a prophet comes

2088
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,940
along and says,
you better look out.

2089
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:43,803
You're off the path.
You're not paying attention to the 

2090
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:48,130
widows and the children and all hell's 
gonna break loose,

2091
01:50:48,131 --> 01:50:50,290
like bang down.
They go six times,

2092
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:53,380
six times,
so you know,

2093
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:59,930
is that arbitrary or is that actually 
the right idea to derive from history?

2094
01:50:59,931 --> 01:51:03,290
It's like power corrupts,
so you make your kingdom,

2095
01:51:03,291 --> 01:51:06,140
you make your empire and it's serving 
its proper purpose,

2096
01:51:06,141 --> 01:51:09,290
but you let it get corrupt.
Things are going to fall apart.

2097
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:10,663
So I can give you an example of that.
It's like what caused the flooding in 

2098
01:51:14,571 --> 01:51:19,571
New Orleans hurricane?
No,

2099
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:22,680
no corruption.

2100
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,810
If the dikes would've been built 
properly,

2101
01:51:25,811 --> 01:51:28,090
as everyone knew,
they should have been built.

2102
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,163
If all those millions of dollars had 
gone into the pockets of corrupt 

2103
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:32,374
politicians,
there wouldn't have been any flood in 

2104
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,960
Holland.
They build the dikes for the worst storm

2105
01:51:37,961 --> 01:51:40,930
in 10,000
years in New Orleans.

2106
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:43,090
They built them for the worst storm in 
100 years.

2107
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:45,160
Well,
everyone knew that was insufficient,

2108
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,170
so why didn't they do something about 
it?

2109
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,660
Well,
if you get corrupt enough,

2110
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:52,840
God will send a flood.
It's like it's an old story.

2111
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:54,790
It's,
it's right.

2112
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,140
It's right.
Now.

2113
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:57,490
The question is,
who is God?

2114
01:51:57,940 --> 01:52:02,940
Where all I would say that the ancient 
Israelites never made.

2115
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:06,670
They never said who god was.
They just said,

2116
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:08,020
look,
the hell out for him.

2117
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:10,600
You deviate from the path,
man.

2118
01:52:10,601 --> 01:52:13,840
You're going to get flattened.
The people who wrote that book,

2119
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:17,410
first of all,
like it was assembled loosely as a book,

2120
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,120
right?
It's a bunch of books.

2121
01:52:19,121 --> 01:52:19,954
That's what Bible means.
It was edited and assembled across vast 

2122
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:23,704
stretches of time.
We have no idea what process led people 

2123
01:52:25,901 --> 01:52:26,734
to assemble it that way,
except that they felt that that made 

2124
01:52:28,901 --> 01:52:29,950
sense.
You know?

2125
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:32,740
So they were guided by their intake,
internal intuition of meaning.

2126
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:36,640
Weirdly enough,
it produced a document with a narrative.

2127
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:41,740
Now the narrative is difficult in some 
ways to discern,

2128
01:52:41,741 --> 01:52:43,750
given all the detail,
you know,

2129
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:46,700
so I would say give our ancestors

2130
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,530
a break for God's sake.
What do you want?

2131
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:53,531
You want absolute perfect coherence when
they're trying to be so inclusive.

2132
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:58,880
Like it's very hard to be coherent when 
you're trying to be inclusive.

2133
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:02,030
Those two things battle.
So you know,

2134
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,910
have a little respect.
That's what,

2135
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:07,520
that's how it looks to me.
Those people weren't stupid.

2136
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,200
They were seriously not stupid and what 
they thought was not stupid.

2137
01:53:12,201 --> 01:53:13,880
Now we can.
We can look at it another ways.

2138
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:15,740
Why is God in the sky?

2139
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:17,253
Well,

2140
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:22,510
I know you can't see it in the city.
What's the fastest way to see infinity?

2141
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:25,330
I'll look up at the night sky.
It's like,

2142
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:29,050
why is God up there?
Because when you look at the night sky,

2143
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:32,860
that's how you feel.
So is that wrong?

2144
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,810
Well,
it's not bad,

2145
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:35,740
you know,
it's like,

2146
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,590
well where's the infinite?
Because that's really the question.

2147
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,710
Well it seems to be up there.
It's like,

2148
01:53:41,711 --> 01:53:43,360
yeah,
right.

2149
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,240
Okay.
So you make your sacrifices.

2150
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:47,440
It's like,
why do people do that?

2151
01:53:47,441 --> 01:53:48,520
God,
that's primitive.

2152
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:49,503
It's like,
no,

2153
01:53:50,170 --> 01:53:51,003
the invention of the sacrifice was 
probably the single greatest stroke of 

2154
01:53:54,431 --> 01:53:56,440
genius that mankind ever

2155
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:59,383
was.
Was,

2156
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:02,840
was given or produced.
What is the sacrifice?

2157
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,033
You give up something of value now so 
that things might be better in the 

2158
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:09,140
future.
It's like that's the human discovery.

2159
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:12,830
That's the human discovery of time.
Everybody makes sacrifices.

2160
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,620
It's like,
I'm going to go to university instead of

2161
01:54:15,621 --> 01:54:18,350
partying and snorting cocaine.
It's like,

2162
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:20,780
because that's fun.
Why?

2163
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:21,733
Well,
because if I organize my behavior 

2164
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:24,650
properly and I make the right 
sacrifices,

2165
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,513
God will smile on me in the future.
Or at least the probability seems 

2166
01:54:27,981 --> 01:54:29,180
enhanced.
It's like,

2167
01:54:29,181 --> 01:54:31,520
okay,
well we don't use the same terminology.

2168
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,330
What we use the same terminology.
We don't burn rabbits,

2169
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:36,980
you know,
but then again,

2170
01:54:36,981 --> 01:54:37,814
we're not agriculturalists.
So the people who are playing with the 

2171
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:41,954
idea of sacrifice,
like they were acting out the discovery 

2172
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:47,540
of time,
you can give up something now try to get

2173
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:50,120
a bone from a dog and tell them you're 
going to give him two boats.

2174
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:52,670
So like he doesn't give a damn about 
that bone.

2175
01:54:52,671 --> 01:54:53,504
Now you know,
and we regard the civilized person as 

2176
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:59,900
the person who's capable of deferring 
gratification.

2177
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:03,680
Deferring gratification is a sacrifice.
Does it please God?

2178
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:04,783
Well,
everyone thinks so or they wouldn't do 

2179
01:55:05,931 --> 01:55:08,060
it.
So the burden,

2180
01:55:08,061 --> 01:55:09,530
the sacrifice,
why?

2181
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:12,170
Well,
God's in heaven,

2182
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:15,320
how else is it going to figure out the 
quality of your sacrifice?

2183
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,371
Well,
you might say,

2184
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:17,240
well,
that's primitive.

2185
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:19,040
It's like,
don't be so sure.

2186
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:21,470
It's like they got to sacrifice idea,
right?

2187
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,300
They go out to all part,
right?

2188
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,880
Like they're acting it out.
It's concretized.

2189
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:29,060
It's like a drama.
Does that make it primitive?

2190
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:30,543
Well,

2191
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,480
no,
it's not primitive.

2192
01:55:33,481 --> 01:55:34,314
It's unbelievably sophisticated.
It's ridiculously sophisticated because 

2193
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:39,074
the mode in the old testament is you 
make the right sacrifices and you will 

2194
01:55:41,851 --> 01:55:42,980
thrive.
Just like,

2195
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:46,080
do we believe that it's the basis of 
civilized behavior.

2196
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,260
You've don't get a complex civilization 
without presupposition.

2197
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,930
I think we've actually done quite well.

2198
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:54,333
Good,
good.

2199
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:55,383
It's hard to keep to a linear track.
Another problem with this kind of 

2200
01:55:58,451 --> 01:55:59,284
material,
it's like you can call that the process 

2201
01:56:02,621 --> 01:56:05,750
of coming to terms with this material,
a circumambulation,

2202
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:10,640
a continual wandering around,
a center know,

2203
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:14,770
and you sort of specify the center by 
almost by inference,

2204
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:16,480
so it's,
it's,

2205
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:18,603
it's one of the things that make us very
difficult to read because everything 

2206
01:56:20,981 --> 01:56:23,320
that he says is dependent on all the 
other things he said.

2207
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,500
That's one of the problems I ran into 
when I was reading maps of meaning to.

2208
01:56:26,501 --> 01:56:27,334
It's like there's a presupposition at 
the bottom that you have to accept in 

2209
01:56:32,081 --> 01:56:32,914
order to follow the logic and the 
presupposition is there are alternative 

2210
01:56:36,731 --> 01:56:37,564
ways of laying out your initial 
presuppositions about the nature of 

2211
01:56:40,541 --> 01:56:42,010
reality.
It's like,

2212
01:56:42,011 --> 01:56:42,844
well,
why should I accept that while I can't 

2213
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:45,304
show you why until you accept it,
because I can't walk you through the 

2214
01:56:46,901 --> 01:56:48,370
argument.
It's a paradigm problem.

2215
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,930
Fundamentally.
So.

2216
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:51,603
So the way I did that in maps of meaning
was that it was kind of like a small 

2217
01:56:54,521 --> 01:56:55,354
circle to begin with and then a bigger 
circle and then a bigger circle and you 

2218
01:56:58,061 --> 01:56:58,894
know,
so I could get all the elements 

2219
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,263
described in a simple way and then make 
it a little more complex than a little 

2220
01:57:03,881 --> 01:57:04,714
more complex.
And that seemed to work to some degree 

2221
01:57:08,471 --> 01:57:09,304
anyways.

2222
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,590
There's something,
I mean not the music of panic,

2223
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:15,840
but there's something so compelling 
about it I think largely in part because

2224
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:21,470
that basic precept position is not 
articulated well or even accepted in the

2225
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:25,470
sorts of science or social science that 
we learned in university.

2226
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,120
Well that's partly why it's so shallow.
The social science in particular,

2227
01:57:29,121 --> 01:57:30,680
it's like,
man,

2228
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:31,613
it's unbelievable.
This like I should be careful about 

2229
01:57:34,101 --> 01:57:34,934
that.
I learned a lot from animal 

2230
01:57:35,691 --> 01:57:38,660
experimentalists a lot and from 
neuroscientists,

2231
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:42,380
but mostly the ones working on animals.
They learn things.

2232
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:44,750
And part of that was a consequence of 
behaviorism,

2233
01:57:44,751 --> 01:57:45,321
which was,
you know,

2234
01:57:45,321 --> 01:57:49,730
a very reductionistic method.
Useful,

2235
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:51,080
you know.
So it's like,

2236
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:51,973
it's not like I dismissed the capacity 
of science to produce useful 

2237
01:57:55,581 --> 01:57:56,810
information.
It's like,

2238
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:59,180
but I'm also terrified of it,
you know,

2239
01:57:59,181 --> 01:58:02,810
it's like there's no reason to be so 
optimistic about scientific truth.

2240
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,440
You know?
The other thing that,

2241
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:09,740
that I've noticed about the rash and 
lists the empiricists,

2242
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,890
you know,
they're sort of often the same corner,

2243
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,083
is that they always make the assumption 
that if we transcend our historical 

2244
01:58:19,011 --> 01:58:24,011
religions will no longer be religious 
and what we will be as rational.

2245
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,040
It's like,
I think,

2246
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:25,581
no,
no,

2247
01:58:25,581 --> 01:58:26,414
you're,
you're completely out of your cotton 

2248
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:28,550
picking mind.
If you think that.

2249
01:58:28,551 --> 01:58:29,780
It's like,
well,

2250
01:58:29,781 --> 01:58:33,380
how do you account for the emergence of 
new age philosophy?

2251
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:37,280
It's like if you want incoherent,
just take a wander through that desert.

2252
01:58:37,281 --> 01:58:40,750
It's like you blow out these 
historically this,

2253
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:44,320
these carefully constructed historical 
frameworks.

2254
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:49,000
What you get is like rampant and insane 
protestantism.

2255
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:50,163
The idea that people will magically 
become like Newton because we blown out 

2256
01:58:55,721 --> 01:58:59,560
the substructure road morality like 
that's so.

2257
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:04,740
That's so absurd that that's the sort of
thought that I think is motivated.

2258
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:06,093
It's like there's a reason to believe 
that because who the hell would believe 

2259
01:59:08,621 --> 01:59:11,560
that it's just you don't know anything 
about people.

2260
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:16,561
If you believe that people are,
it's hard to think scientifically.

2261
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,200
It's really hard.
Here's a way of thinking too.

2262
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:24,220
You can think,
you can reduce religion to,

2263
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:28,150
to sort of Darwinian principles and sort
of destroy it that way,

2264
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,273
you know,
or you can expand your notion of 

2265
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:31,750
Darwinism.

2266
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:36,010
So that actually encompasses the genuine
phenomena of religion.

2267
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:38,830
Man,
that is way more interesting,

2268
01:59:38,831 --> 01:59:41,320
but the problem is it's also the 
problem.

2269
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:44,800
The reason that people won't read young 
first.

2270
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:46,660
He's very difficult.
Second,

2271
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,553
he is terrifying.
It's terrifying to reveal so well 

2272
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:55,240
because it means no one thinks like,
like he thought,

2273
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:57,060
nobody thinks like that.
I mean he,

2274
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,340
his grasp of the development of ideas 
stretched over,

2275
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:01,660
like I said,
10,000

2276
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:02,430
years.
It,

2277
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:05,560
it puts the enlightenment thinkers to 
shame,

2278
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:07,420
but,
but the,

2279
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:08,313
if you start grappling seriously with 
the idea that ideas have people instead 

2280
02:00:11,591 --> 02:00:15,640
of people having ideas,
that forces you to reevaluate the entire

2281
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:16,930
nature of your being.
Does.

2282
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:21,490
The other thing he asked is which ideas 
have you and where are they?

2283
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:22,743
Where are,
where are they suggesting that you go 

2284
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:27,550
and like,
that's like the Greek God idea,

2285
02:00:27,551 --> 02:00:29,950
right?
We're play things of the gods like,

2286
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:31,480
well,
don't darken already.

2287
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,313
Darkens already knows about memes.
These are like metal memes and so let's 

2288
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:40,150
not be too in cautious about who's in 
control here.

2289
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,710
So it's like,
okay,

2290
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:42,783
well you've developed a nihilistic 
philosophy that's predicated on 

2291
02:00:45,281 --> 02:00:46,450
rationalism.
Fine.

2292
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:49,420
Why?
Who's behind that?

2293
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,970
Precisely you.
It's like he had,

2294
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:53,770
right?
No Way.

2295
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:58,250
Thousand other people wouldn't think 
exactly the same way if it was you,

2296
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:03,460
you're just in its grip and what's it up
to the.

2297
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:06,880
It's up for the betterment of humanity.
Sure.

2298
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:08,860
Maybe,
but you know,

2299
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:12,640
I wouldn't bet my life on it when you 
wrote about Alchemy,

2300
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:16,780
which his writings on alchemy are 
incredibly opaque,

2301
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,790
but I can give you a bit of an insight 
into them.

2302
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,800
You can understand young's readings on 
copy.

2303
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,643
If you start from the presupposition 
that the matter that alchemists were 

2304
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:28,810
studying wasn't matter,
it was information.

2305
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:30,783
Now you know the relationship between 
matter and information is very complex 

2306
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:38,320
and some people think the substrate of 
things is information and matt matter is

2307
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:40,370
sort of an emergent property,
whatever.

2308
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,140
It's complicated.
Now,

2309
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:48,040
if you're studying information,
you can't study it objectively precisely

2310
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:54,140
because as you study the information,
you get informed that changes you.

2311
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,450
And so the problem with studying this 
sort of thing is that you can't study it

2312
02:01:59,451 --> 02:02:02,990
without being changed because if you're 
not changed by studying it,

2313
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:04,003
you're not studying it.
It's not your no anthropologist who's 

2314
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:07,784
outside of this.
You can't be because if you're outside 

2315
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:10,574
of it,
you don't understand it because if you 

2316
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:14,930
understand it,
then you're not the same person anymore.

2317
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,183
So you can't keep it at bay.
And so that's also partly why humans is 

2318
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:21,770
terrifying.
You know,

2319
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:25,370
there's this I read and I don't remember
where,

2320
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:26,930
you know,
there's a crucifix,

2321
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:31,970
has Latin letters on the top of it and 
it's Inri.

2322
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:36,050
It means it's,
it's the representation of Jesus Christ,

2323
02:02:36,051 --> 02:02:36,884
King of the Jews,
hypothetically that was put on his 

2324
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:39,674
cross.

2325
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,693
Um,
there's an occult interpretation of 

2326
02:02:42,891 --> 02:02:44,210
that,
which is also Latin,

2327
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:45,073
which I can't remember,
but it means all nature is renewed by 

2328
02:02:47,691 --> 02:02:49,740
fire.
And so the,

2329
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:54,440
the crucifixion then is assimilated to 
the idea of a forest fire.

2330
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:56,510
Everything burns down before there's new
growth.

2331
02:02:56,930 --> 02:03:00,650
If you study religion properly,
it will demolish your personality,

2332
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,293
your personality,
the personality that's you is like the 

2333
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:07,400
dead branches on a,
on a pine tree.

2334
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:09,620
So like you might be clinging to them 
because you think,

2335
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:11,060
well,
I'm all these dead branches.

2336
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:11,894
It's like,
well,

2337
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:14,750
yeah,
but first of all,

2338
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:15,584
you should let go of the and second you 
should let them burn off and then you 

2339
02:03:18,231 --> 02:03:18,741
might think,
well,

2340
02:03:18,741 --> 02:03:20,990
I don't want them to burn off because 
that's me.

2341
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,891
It's like,
yeah,

2342
02:03:21,891 --> 02:03:23,080
that's true,
but it's,

2343
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:25,640
it's the false you that you're clinging 
to.

2344
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:29,000
Well that doesn't mean you want to be 
burned up in the flames.

2345
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,403
So to study this material properly is to
be burned up in the flames and there's 

2346
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:37,970
no escaping that.
You're just not in it.

2347
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,740
If you're.
If that doesn't happen,

2348
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:44,510
you don't get it.
Like one of the things I realized when I

2349
02:03:44,511 --> 02:03:49,220
started studying this was that virtually
everything I said was a lie.

2350
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:55,360
I would say 99 percent.
And by lie I mean it was manipulative.

2351
02:03:56,450 --> 02:03:57,283
It was unclear,
it was vague and that was all often 

2352
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:04,271
motivated or it was a false attempt to 
gain dominance status,

2353
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:06,950
which is typical of someone who's 
intellectuals like,

2354
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:08,720
well,
I've got these ideas,

2355
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:12,500
I've taken them from places and now I 
can use them as say,

2356
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:13,460
status,
weapon,

2357
02:04:13,461 --> 02:04:14,294
something like that,
which is what people do when they're 

2358
02:04:15,621 --> 02:04:18,890
trying to win an argument.
Say it's like that's all lies.

2359
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,581
It's like,
well,

2360
02:04:19,581 --> 02:04:22,160
that's rough when it's 99 percent of 
what you say,

2361
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:23,323
first of all,
the first thing you realize is how much 

2362
02:04:24,591 --> 02:04:26,560
you aren't.
You're not neat.

2363
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:28,790
You know,
you're,

2364
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:33,380
you have your experience as your claim 
to reality and it's often pretty thin.

2365
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:34,963
But,
but the development of authentic speech 

2366
02:04:37,951 --> 02:04:40,530
is worth the price that you have to pay 
for it.

2367
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:41,933
So,
but you just can't stay detached from 

2368
02:04:44,851 --> 02:04:47,370
this.
This isn't the phenomenon to study.

2369
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:51,770
It's like the basis of.
It's the basis of being so,

2370
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:52,860
so on that note,

2371
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,410
because that's,
that's,

2372
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,150
that's,
uh,

2373
02:04:56,151 --> 02:05:00,380
an expression of your experience really 
delving in depth into the material.

2374
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:04,970
Whereas there are other researchers 
looking at this from a,

2375
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,110
from a different angle.
I'm not saying it's more or less valid,

2376
02:05:07,130 --> 02:05:08,470
it's just different.
Right,

2377
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:13,100
and they're looking at this from a why 
not necessarily why or how does religion

2378
02:05:13,101 --> 02:05:13,934
come about?
Where did these ideas come from and why 

2379
02:05:15,171 --> 02:05:18,590
are they important so much as once 
they're there,

2380
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:22,940
why do they perpetuate?
Why are they successful?

2381
02:05:22,941 --> 02:05:27,941
Why do religions exists when they seem,
when there's seems to be so much that or

2382
02:05:28,461 --> 02:05:30,700
rationalist would find objectionable or 
just.

2383
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:31,753
Sure.
Sure.

2384
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:34,790
So then that begs the question,
whose silly?

2385
02:05:35,630 --> 02:05:37,790
The rationalist assumes that it's not 
him.

2386
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:39,320
It's like,
okay,

2387
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:42,680
let's have some evidence while we can 
fly to the moon.

2388
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:45,410
Fair enough.
That's one form of evidence.

2389
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:48,860
How long has this been working?
Two hundred years.

2390
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:53,480
Okay.
Let's say rate rated for a million years

2391
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:54,613
and see what happens right now.
You know when you can object to that 

2392
02:05:57,141 --> 02:05:57,861
because you can say,
well,

2393
02:05:57,861 --> 02:05:59,690
who knows where the future will lead and
so on,

2394
02:05:59,691 --> 02:06:01,710
but my point is is that,
well,

2395
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,653
it's again,
it's what you assume to be true 

2396
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:09,243
structures your argument and you have to
assume something to be true because you 

2397
02:06:12,701 --> 02:06:16,180
don't have infinite knowledge.
So you make that initial choice.

2398
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:17,343
Why?
While it might be because you're a true 

2399
02:06:20,771 --> 02:06:22,540
truth seeker.
Well,

2400
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,760
I would be careful about making that 
claim.

2401
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:27,370
Right?
Because you're probably not.

2402
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:30,040
So then who are you

2403
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:31,860
innovated by something that we're not 
aware of that

2404
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,470
is that there's no probably about that.

2405
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:37,400
Yeah.
Not only that,

2406
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:40,250
you might be motivated by terrible 
things that you're not aware of,

2407
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:43,310
like truly terrible things.
You know,

2408
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:44,144
one of the things he said about the 
shadow which was for him that was sort 

2409
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:48,314
of all those parts of you that weren't 
very developed and are mad about it 

2410
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:52,590
because you're like,
you know,

2411
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:57,680
trying to kill them and all those sort 
of storehouse of lies and deception that

2412
02:06:57,681 --> 02:06:58,514
you've managed and all the things you've
left on done and the motivations for 

2413
02:07:01,971 --> 02:07:04,460
doing all that.
It's like that's the shadow said,

2414
02:07:04,461 --> 02:07:09,100
well the shadow is rooted in hell and,
and you know,

2415
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:10,550
you think,
well that's a nice metaphor.

2416
02:07:10,551 --> 02:07:12,950
It's like,
don't be so sure it's a metaphor.

2417
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:16,760
It's not exactly a metaphor.
I mean,

2418
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,960
I can,
I can,

2419
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:18,943
I can elaborate on that a little bit.
If you walk down bloor street and you 

2420
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:27,734
watch,
you can see people in hell with no 

2421
02:07:29,451 --> 02:07:30,284
problem.
I think they're not only the people who 

2422
02:07:32,421 --> 02:07:37,090
are completely lost the homeless,
but the homeless that you cannot look at

2423
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:38,643
and the reason you can't look at them is
because they find your act of mirroring 

2424
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:47,320
their state of existence intolerable.
It will instantly enrage them and that's

2425
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:50,200
because they're in chaos there in the 
underworld,

2426
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,273
but they're in a particular suburb of 
the underworld and that little suburb 

2427
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,530
that's hell.
And you think,

2428
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:57,340
well,
is it a more,

2429
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,270
is it eternal?

2430
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:02,550
Depends what you mean.
It's been around a long time.

2431
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,580
It's been around a long time and it's 
really deep.

2432
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:07,710
And there's another weird thing about 
hell,

2433
02:08:07,711 --> 02:08:10,860
which is if you're in it,
no matter how bad it is,

2434
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:13,950
there's some stupid thing you can do to 
make it worse.

2435
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:17,880
And that's why it's bottomless.
It's not obvious.

2436
02:08:17,881 --> 02:08:21,030
What's a metaphor?
You know?

2437
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,200
Does Heaven Exist?

2438
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,633
Depends on what you mean.
I think people get glimpses of it all 

2439
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:30,310
the time.
Those are,

2440
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:33,040
those are the times in your life when 
the meaning shines through,

2441
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:37,240
it's like that's a place when the 
meaning shines through.

2442
02:08:37,241 --> 02:08:40,690
That's a place like if you conceptualize
things as four dimensional,

2443
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:46,140
this place shifts with time.
So we're actually sitting in a multitude

2444
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:47,314
of places here now and then that place 
configures itself so that it's as 

2445
02:08:52,541 --> 02:08:56,410
perfect as it can be.
You get a glimpse and then you think,

2446
02:08:56,411 --> 02:08:56,930
well,
what?

2447
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,260
What if it could always be like that.
It's like,

2448
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:01,270
well,
what if it could be always like that?

2449
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:03,790
And also you might say,
for example,

2450
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:06,160
what would happen if everybody told the 
truth?

2451
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:11,470
We know what happens when people don't.
You get the Gulag archipelago.

2452
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:16,930
What's the opposite of that?
Well,

2453
02:09:16,931 --> 02:09:17,764
we don't know.
We do know that there's an opposite 

2454
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:20,344
though,
so people are in cautious about their 

2455
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,193
discussions of what constitutes real.
They don't even notice their own 

2456
02:09:29,171 --> 02:09:31,690
experience.
You've never been to the underworld,

2457
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:34,780
so like you've been there every time 
things have fallen apart in your life.

2458
02:09:34,781 --> 02:09:36,730
I tell people that all the time in my 
lectures.

2459
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,470
Here's what the underworld meets.

2460
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,760
You've been married for 10 years,
you're happily married,

2461
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:44,980
you come home,
your wife's go on.

2462
02:09:44,981 --> 02:09:49,450
There's a note that says I'm leaving 
with my lover of the last 10 years.

2463
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:51,250
It's like,
well,

2464
02:09:51,251 --> 02:09:52,084
you were somewhere before you walked 
into the house and now you're somewhere 

2465
02:09:54,971 --> 02:09:56,770
different.
Where are you now?

2466
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,300
What year where you go when the bottom 
drops out,

2467
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,400
where's that?
Well,

2468
02:10:02,401 --> 02:10:04,950
it's in the underworld like here in the 
underworld.

2469
02:10:04,951 --> 02:10:09,720
You're in that chaotic state that exists
before order is constructed.

2470
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:11,130
You go there all the time

2471
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,073
and the reason people can't,
can't see the connection between their 

2472
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,580
experience and these earlier,
um,

2473
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:18,673
mythological representations is because 
people are being adequate mystic and 

2474
02:10:22,311 --> 02:10:23,144
reinterpreting the mythological 
representations as if their scientific 

2475
02:10:26,571 --> 02:10:29,120
theories as if these people were naive 
scientists,

2476
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:30,303
really what they were doing is coming up
with images to explain things that they 

2477
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,033
otherwise represent.
But we're real in terms of their lived 

2478
02:10:36,081 --> 02:10:36,914
experience.

2479
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:38,760
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2480
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,820
Yeah.
Why?

2481
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:42,100
Why would we think they were naive 
scientist?

2482
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:45,790
What?
What is a chimp a naive scientist like?

2483
02:10:45,810 --> 02:10:47,910
It's just silly.
It's it.

2484
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:49,960
They weren't live scientists,
whatever they were doing.

2485
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:50,973
Well,
I think they were naive 

2486
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:54,100
phenomenologists,
but they weren't very naive.

2487
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:57,640
They weren't concerned with material 
reality.

2488
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:00,940
They were concerned with the nature of 
being.

2489
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:03,130
It's not.
I mean that's heidegger's claim,

2490
02:11:03,131 --> 02:11:04,120
right?
He believed that.

2491
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,550
And I again,
I didn't know this until much later.

2492
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:11,710
Heidegger believe that philosophy 
actually lost its way with the Greeks,

2493
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:14,860
with Plato for example,
when things became rationalized,

2494
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:15,933
Nicha thought the same thing in many 
ways because he was very interested in 

2495
02:11:18,281 --> 02:11:20,680
the Dionysian right.
Which is more like,

2496
02:11:22,150 --> 02:11:24,940
well that's more like lived experience,
the Dionysian,

2497
02:11:24,941 --> 02:11:25,774
you know,
that's the chemist who goes out and you 

2498
02:11:27,791 --> 02:11:28,624
know,
maybe he's a punk rocker in his spare 

2499
02:11:31,601 --> 02:11:34,170
time and he goes out in the evening and 
listens to a,

2500
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:35,023
you know,
a thrash metal band in bounds himself 

2501
02:11:37,031 --> 02:11:38,020
against other people.

2502
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:40,180
It's like,
it doesn't see any contradiction there.

2503
02:11:40,510 --> 02:11:41,343
It's like,
well,

2504
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:45,070
one's rational and now there isn't.
That's a contradiction,

2505
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:46,043
you know?
And while you find the irrational 

2506
02:11:47,171 --> 02:11:49,630
activity enjoyable,
well how do you account for that?

2507
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:53,110
You don't just keep the world separate.
It's like,

2508
02:11:53,111 --> 02:11:53,944
so these are ancestors were 
phenomenologists and they were 

2509
02:11:58,061 --> 02:11:59,550
accounting for the,
their,

2510
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:01,060
their landscapes.
There,

2511
02:12:01,061 --> 02:12:04,510
the geography of being straight.
Well there's an underworld.

2512
02:12:04,660 --> 02:12:05,890
Well,
when do you go there?

2513
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:06,430
Well,
when,

2514
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:08,020
when things fall apart,
it's like,

2515
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,660
that's where you end up.
Like everyone gets that,

2516
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:13,270
you know,
I tell these stories to retirees and all

2517
02:12:13,271 --> 02:12:14,950
sorts of people say,
well look,

2518
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:17,600
you know,
there's a place that you go.

2519
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:19,210
When everything falls apart,
it's like,

2520
02:12:19,211 --> 02:12:20,470
oh,
I've been there.

2521
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:21,910
Then the question is,
well,

2522
02:12:21,911 --> 02:12:22,744
what do you do when you get there?
Because everybody needs to know that 

2523
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:26,133
that's another thing that religious 
stories or trying to tell you when 

2524
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:30,430
things fall apart,
what do you do?

2525
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,190
Well,
we don't think of when things fall apart

2526
02:12:33,191 --> 02:12:35,860
as a place,
but that's our problem.

2527
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:37,053
It's a place.
I mean people live in del you'd have to 

2528
02:12:38,891 --> 02:12:40,630
do is go look on the street.
So like,

2529
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:42,490
oh look,
that person's in the underworld.

2530
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:46,090
It's like adding that person's inhale 
and you can tell,

2531
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,130
but you won't look.
Hey.

2532
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:47,973
You know,
what usually happens in a circumstance 

2533
02:12:49,241 --> 02:12:50,074
like that is there is so much inhale 
that you'll just walk around them and 

2534
02:12:53,231 --> 02:12:55,480
you will look at them.
Why not?

2535
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:58,780
You don't want to go there.
Yeah,

2536
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,570
that's right.
That expression in English.

2537
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:02,870
Yeah.
Right,

2538
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:03,820
right.

2539
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:04,653
So there,
there is encoded in the way we think 

2540
02:13:06,431 --> 02:13:09,130
there is this inherent locality or 
geographies.

2541
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:09,801
Yeah.
Well,

2542
02:13:09,801 --> 02:13:11,360
and it is a geography,
like it's,

2543
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:12,203
it's a,
it's a,

2544
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:14,660
it's a slice of space time,
you know,

2545
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:17,510
so you know,
it's also the street,

2546
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,430
but it's not just the street,
it's,

2547
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:23,810
it's,
it's the being of the street,

2548
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:27,580
it's everything that's,
that's afforded by the representation of

2549
02:13:27,581 --> 02:13:28,350
street.
Nevermind,

2550
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:31,070
it has,
it has other meanings beyond what we do,

2551
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:33,080
which is something that we didn't touch 
on at all actually,

2552
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:33,953
which we had,
which is as the complexity management 

2553
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:42,620
theory angle in the sense that how we 
compartmentalize reality is not at all a

2554
02:13:42,991 --> 02:13:43,890
given,
right?

2555
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:44,350
I mean,

2556
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:45,670
no,
you do it on the fly,

2557
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,460
right?
And you do it for pragmatic reasons,

2558
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,353
you know,
and so in some sense what you do is you 

2559
02:13:50,471 --> 02:13:51,304
look for the simplest possible and least
energetic way of conceptualizing the 

2560
02:13:55,991 --> 02:13:59,800
current situation so that the next thing
you want to do happens.

2561
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:03,250
It's something like that.
And I like to think about it in terms of

2562
02:14:03,251 --> 02:14:04,900
resolution,
you know,

2563
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:07,750
because I think resolutions are really 
useful idea.

2564
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:11,650
Most of our representations of reality 
are extremely low resolution,

2565
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:14,020
like will rely on a thumbnail,
well why not?

2566
02:14:14,650 --> 02:14:15,860
What's good enough?
Right?

2567
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:17,470
It's pragmatic,
it's good enough,

2568
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:18,333
you know,
don't make it any more complex than it 

2569
02:14:19,661 --> 02:14:20,494
has to be.
And what you are managing always is 

2570
02:14:22,511 --> 02:14:25,310
complexity because the thing that 
you're,

2571
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:28,150
the representation you use,
which is an image,

2572
02:14:28,151 --> 02:14:28,984
let's say,
is a low resolution representation of 

2573
02:14:31,331 --> 02:14:33,070
the reality behind the image.

2574
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:35,320
So for example,
you're sitting there,

2575
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,213
okay,
well I can't see your back so I can't 

2576
02:14:38,111 --> 02:14:40,240
see your family.
I can't see your culture.

2577
02:14:40,241 --> 02:14:43,510
I can't see your education.
I can't see the biosphere that you're an

2578
02:14:43,511 --> 02:14:46,570
embedded part of.
I can't see any of your substructures.

2579
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:50,500
It's like they're all there.
They're just as real as the thing that I

2580
02:14:50,501 --> 02:14:51,334
see.
They're causally implicated in 

2581
02:14:53,351 --> 02:14:56,170
everything that you do.
It's like that's complexity.

2582
02:14:56,171 --> 02:14:58,000
So you know,
maybe you know,

2583
02:14:58,001 --> 02:15:00,490
I'm assuming that you're,
you're,

2584
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:05,550
I'm assuming that you're what we both 
decided to allow to be possible here,

2585
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:09,550
right?
Because we're both polite.

2586
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,790
We're doing this little act that,
you know,

2587
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,330
we both agree on,
we've never met,

2588
02:15:13,331 --> 02:15:16,570
but we were going to run this routine.
We're going to play by the rules.

2589
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,673
But you know,
like for all I know you could just turn 

2590
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:21,580
left right now.
You know,

2591
02:15:21,581 --> 02:15:25,060
and then all of a sudden all that 
complexity is like,

2592
02:15:25,061 --> 02:15:25,960
it's there.

2593
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:28,450
That's chaos.
It's like that's a potential too because

2594
02:15:28,451 --> 02:15:29,890
maybe I think,
well,

2595
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:33,760
what we're doing is too mundane,
boring,

2596
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:34,653
and I'm,
I'm,

2597
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:35,613
I'm caught in it.
It's like I hope you turned left a 

2598
02:15:37,571 --> 02:15:40,660
little bit because then that's the water
of life to that,

2599
02:15:40,810 --> 02:15:43,750
you know,
that refreshing complexity comes back.

2600
02:15:43,751 --> 02:15:45,640
But hopefully not too much of it.
Right?

2601
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:46,723
I don't want too much of it.
I want a little bite size piece of it 

2602
02:15:49,421 --> 02:15:51,910
that will make me interested in not 
terrified.

2603
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:53,373
So that's complexity and that's,
that's a better way of conceptualizing 

2604
02:15:57,011 --> 02:16:00,490
what the terror management guys are 
after with regards to the fear of death,

2605
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:02,073
you know?
So partly I don't think they're very 

2606
02:16:03,581 --> 02:16:04,414
imaginative.
There's much many worse things than 

2607
02:16:07,301 --> 02:16:11,560
death to be terrified of.
Like insanity is probably one,

2608
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:14,890
you know,
pain that's a bad one.

2609
02:16:15,070 --> 02:16:18,010
Longterm pain,
that's a bad one.

2610
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:20,590
Well then there's longterm pointless 
pain,

2611
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:21,933
you know,
then there's your longterm pointless 

2612
02:16:23,291 --> 02:16:24,760
pain and that of your family.

2613
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:25,593
Like there's,
there's horrors that exceed death by 

2614
02:16:28,181 --> 02:16:32,170
orders of.
So to make that,

2615
02:16:32,171 --> 02:16:35,470
the fundamental fear I think is.
I think that's an error.

2616
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:37,110
You know,
it's like,

2617
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:41,320
what are people more afraid of dying or 
having their children die?

2618
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:43,090
You know,
that's,

2619
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:49,260
that's a perfectly reasonable question.
So I read Becker,

2620
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:53,140
really read it.
Like I liked Becker's book.

2621
02:16:53,141 --> 02:16:55,990
It's brilliant,
but he makes a bunch of mistakes for one

2622
02:16:55,991 --> 02:16:57,280
of the things he does,
for example,

2623
02:16:57,281 --> 02:16:58,114
is right in the intro,
he says it's a book that's trying to 

2624
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:04,240
bring about the psychoanalytic closure 
of the study of religion.

2625
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:05,343
So it's Neil Freud in smartly,
neil frightened and he wants to explain 

2626
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:12,490
religion pretty much completely within 
the psychoanalytic framework,

2627
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:15,220
does a great job,
but in the intro he says,

2628
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:16,083
well,
you might wonder why in a book that's 

2629
02:17:17,501 --> 02:17:22,090
devoted to the last word in 
psychoanalytic thinking about religion,

2630
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:24,100
I never mentioned you.

2631
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:26,260
So then he says a bunch of things about 
young.

2632
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:30,730
One of them is I could never understand 
a single thing he was talking about when

2633
02:17:30,731 --> 02:17:32,620
he wrote all his works on alchemy.
It's like,

2634
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,633
oh,
well that's a problem because that's 

2635
02:17:35,021 --> 02:17:39,520
where all the information that your book
lacks is all of it.

2636
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:40,810
You missed it.
It's like,

2637
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:43,720
yeah,
you're thinking about the hero myth,

2638
02:17:43,721 --> 02:17:47,320
for example,
as a delusion and you know,

2639
02:17:47,321 --> 02:17:48,154
as a hero project and has something 
that's only there to stave off the fear 

2640
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:51,880
of death.
It's like,

2641
02:17:51,881 --> 02:17:56,881
well you got a good way into the depths 
but,

2642
02:17:58,950 --> 02:18:03,950
and way farther than most people get,
but you missed the next 300 stories.

2643
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:07,780
So.
And that's too bad.

2644
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:09,393
So you know,
and it's funny because I've also read 

2645
02:18:10,781 --> 02:18:13,720
the social psychology,
a fair bit of it that is associated with

2646
02:18:13,721 --> 02:18:14,554
Tara management and most of the problem 
with it is it hasn't moved becker one 

2647
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:18,310
inch.

2648
02:18:18,310 --> 02:18:19,120
It's like,
yeah,

2649
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:22,000
that's what Becker said.
So we're proving it.

2650
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:22,893
Well no,
not really because the demonstrations 

2651
02:18:27,731 --> 02:18:30,370
are amenable to multiple 
interpretations,

2652
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:34,090
but Becker he covered it.
I mean it's a brilliant book,

2653
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,300
but it's wrong.
So,

2654
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:38,133
so on that note is this argument is 
wrong for people that may not have read 

2655
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:44,770
it back or they're not fully aware of 
the terror management theory.

2656
02:18:44,910 --> 02:18:45,743
Well,
because he thinks he thinks of 

2657
02:18:46,331 --> 02:18:49,610
everything that we do to contend with 
mortality as Ann Rousse,

2658
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:54,100
you know,
and I don't think that's right because I

2659
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:58,300
don't think that it's necessary to be 
terrified of death now.

2660
02:18:58,301 --> 02:19:02,440
It's not easy not to be,
but you know,

2661
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:03,633
it's fate that as far as Becker's 
concerned is that that's what you're 

2662
02:19:07,061 --> 02:19:08,380
going to be terrified.
It's like,

2663
02:19:08,381 --> 02:19:12,220
well,
I don't think that that's right.

2664
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:15,040
I think that people don't have to be 
terrified of death.

2665
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:19,300
It's not an easy state to achieve.
It's not like I want to die.

2666
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:22,390
Although I can certainly imagine things 
that are worse than that,

2667
02:19:22,450 --> 02:19:25,060
like no problem.
So I think,

2668
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:28,340
and this is something sold units and 
laid out in the Gulag archipelago too,

2669
02:19:28,341 --> 02:19:31,130
I think there are ways of living that 
are worse than death.

2670
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:34,100
That's why people commit suicide.
That's their decision.

2671
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:38,360
So obviously hell is worse than death,
you know,

2672
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:42,710
given how I described it earlier.
So it isn't death.

2673
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:44,090
That's the problem.
It's complexity.

2674
02:19:44,091 --> 02:19:46,700
That's the problem is that things are 
beyond us.

2675
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:47,803
Because of that,
they always exceed what our models tell 

2676
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:55,340
us they're going to do,
or they always transformed themselves in

2677
02:19:55,341 --> 02:19:58,460
some ungainly ways so that we don't get 
what we want.

2678
02:19:59,090 --> 02:20:01,160
So then the question is,
well,

2679
02:20:01,161 --> 02:20:01,994
how do you best deal with complexity?
And the reason I think truth is so 

2680
02:20:05,271 --> 02:20:08,900
useful is because generally it reduces 
complexity,

2681
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:10,130
right?

2682
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:10,963
I mean,
one of the things that's really useful 

2683
02:20:12,531 --> 02:20:13,364
about trying to say things that you 
believe to be true is you don't have to 

2684
02:20:17,271 --> 02:20:19,880
remember what you said.
It's like,

2685
02:20:19,881 --> 02:20:20,714
well,
what did I say?

2686
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,381
Well,
I don't know,

2687
02:20:21,381 --> 02:20:23,780
but I was trying to explain things 
properly.

2688
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:24,733
Then you don't have to tear through all 
your rationalizations and think about 

2689
02:20:28,251 --> 02:20:30,860
what you have to keep track of like 
deceptions.

2690
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:32,270
They grow,
you know,

2691
02:20:32,271 --> 02:20:34,610
they're like hydrus so well,
don't do that.

2692
02:20:34,611 --> 02:20:37,040
Okay,
truth simpler.

2693
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,870
That's one big advantage.
You know,

2694
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:41,060
and people can say,
well,

2695
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:44,240
truth isn't always the answer.
Well,

2696
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:47,840
there are some times you get into a 
situation that's so awful.

2697
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:48,973
You've made so many mistakes that not 
only would it be very difficult for 

2698
02:20:54,501 --> 02:20:55,334
truth to rescue you,
you've already worked your character to 

2699
02:20:58,161 --> 02:21:00,020
such a degree that you couldn't even use
it.

2700
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:01,010
Well,
you've had it,

2701
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:02,000
you know,
you're,

2702
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:02,833
you're off the radar at that point,
and nothing short of a miracle would 

2703
02:21:04,941 --> 02:21:05,774
save you.

2704
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:11,400
To what degree do you think that one of 
the lessons that you've extrapolated and

2705
02:21:12,311 --> 02:21:14,950
you put it in,
you put it into words,

2706
02:21:14,951 --> 02:21:15,784
are,
are easily applied across various 

2707
02:21:18,791 --> 02:21:19,624
cultures that you may not have 
necessarily addressed in your 

2708
02:21:21,881 --> 02:21:22,714
examination of mythology.
And I'm challenging you a little bit 

2709
02:21:24,761 --> 02:21:26,650
here just because it's an interesting 
topic.

2710
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:31,690
For instance,
Islam just doesn't feature at all in the

2711
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,880
work that you've written as I've as I've
read,

2712
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,773
but it's,
it's a,

2713
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:38,710
it's a hugely important religion on a 
global scale.

2714
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:41,590
And even in countries like Canada.
Um,

2715
02:21:42,610 --> 02:21:43,443
and then there's also the question of 
with so many people coming with 

2716
02:21:46,991 --> 02:21:47,824
different specific mythologies or 
embodiments of the universe mythology 

2717
02:21:53,241 --> 02:21:55,870
that we're discussing,
what are the,

2718
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:56,704
I mean this is sort of a unique episode 
in human history in the sense of just 

2719
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,400
the scale and the rapidity with which 
people are coming into contact with each

2720
02:22:03,401 --> 02:22:04,234
other from very different backgrounds.
So what do you see as the implications 

2721
02:22:07,991 --> 02:22:11,300
of that for good or for bad in a,
in a country like

2722
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,193
Canada,
the fact that people are coming 

2723
02:22:13,681 --> 02:22:14,514
together,

2724
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:15,623
but from those very different cultural 
places in which maybe there's a 

2725
02:22:19,511 --> 02:22:22,570
universal mythology that,
that envelops all of them.

2726
02:22:22,571 --> 02:22:23,404
But the values and the particular 
embodiments of mythology that people 

2727
02:22:27,250 --> 02:22:28,083
have grown up with are often very 
different than they and these and these 

2728
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:32,490
come,
these can clash.

2729
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,070
I mean I'm not a,
not a tribal,

2730
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:38,730
tribal,
tribal and I don't mean in a,

2731
02:22:38,731 --> 02:22:39,564
in a,
in the clash of civilizations sort of 

2732
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:42,660
overblown away.
But I'm just saying on a,

2733
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:43,573
on a pragmatic level,
people are often operating in different 

2734
02:22:45,211 --> 02:22:46,320
psychological space.

2735
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:47,913
Well,
to some degree that the issue there is 

2736
02:22:49,071 --> 02:22:52,820
whether or not you can negotiate,
right society,

2737
02:22:52,821 --> 02:22:57,230
a multicultural society in many ways is 
dependent on negotiation.

2738
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,870
And you know,
here's another sort of axiom.

2739
02:22:59,871 --> 02:23:02,450
It's tyranny,
slavery in negotiation.

2740
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,160
Those are your options.
You want to be a tyrant?

2741
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:05,810
Fine,
you're going to be a slave,

2742
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:06,793
that's an option,
but if you don't want to be either of 

2743
02:23:08,241 --> 02:23:09,260
those,
you'd negotiate,

2744
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:10,543
okay?
So how do you negotiate or partly you 

2745
02:23:12,711 --> 02:23:13,544
pay attention so you listen.
And so now here's another way to think 

2746
02:23:17,421 --> 02:23:18,930
about it.
Just like the totality,

2747
02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:19,783
your tarion assumes that what he knows 
will redeem him to sort of the basis of 

2748
02:23:23,511 --> 02:23:25,400
terror management theory in some sense,
right?

2749
02:23:25,730 --> 02:23:28,220
So what you know protects you and keeps 
you safe,

2750
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:29,503
okay?
And so you want to tighten that up and 

2751
02:23:30,951 --> 02:23:31,784
you want to make it rigorous and you 
don't want anything to exist outside of 

2752
02:23:33,651 --> 02:23:34,360
it.

2753
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:35,860
Okay?
Now they're so,

2754
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,570
so in some ways you worship the great 
father.

2755
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:42,230
That's a way of thinking about it.
Here's another way of thinking about it.

2756
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:44,960
What you don't know will redeem you.
Well,

2757
02:23:44,961 --> 02:23:45,650
why?
Well,

2758
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:49,330
because you already know what you know 
and now then you can ask yourself,

2759
02:23:49,331 --> 02:23:50,420
well,
is that enough?

2760
02:23:51,170 --> 02:23:52,940
And then that the answer to that is,
well,

2761
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:57,890
what's the quality of your life if the 
quality of your life is what you want it

2762
02:23:57,891 --> 02:24:02,270
to be,
really then what you know is enough,

2763
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:03,853
but the probability that your quality of
life is what you want it to be is very 

2764
02:24:06,411 --> 02:24:07,244
low because you're still prone to all 
sorts of suffering and all sorts of 

2765
02:24:10,730 --> 02:24:14,410
ignorance and and you know you can face 
that forthrightly.

2766
02:24:14,510 --> 02:24:15,343
It's one of the things that didn't 
happen in the Soviet Union because 

2767
02:24:17,511 --> 02:24:19,550
everybody said,
my quality of life is great.

2768
02:24:19,550 --> 02:24:23,290
We know everything we need to know when 
in reality it was like abysmal,

2769
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:24,890
murderous,
treacherous,

2770
02:24:24,891 --> 02:24:26,390
deceitful.
It was horrible,

2771
02:24:26,391 --> 02:24:27,980
but you know,
so what that meant,

2772
02:24:27,981 --> 02:24:30,800
it was at that in the Soviet Union.
If you admitted to ward,

2773
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,790
if you admitted to your own suffering,
you were a trader.

2774
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:36,193
Well,
that's the.

2775
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:37,033
That's hell.
So you can't even let your suffering be 

2776
02:24:39,771 --> 02:24:40,604
true,
right?

2777
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:43,700
Not only do you have to suffer,
but you can't even admit it.

2778
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:45,650
Okay?
So back to listening,

2779
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:46,543
it's like,
well,

2780
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:51,650
if you assume that what you don't know 
his redemptive,

2781
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:55,460
then you can listen,
you can listen because he never know.

2782
02:24:55,461 --> 02:24:58,940
That person might know something that 
you don't know and maybe that would be a

2783
02:24:58,941 --> 02:24:59,774
useful something you know and maybe you 
have something to say that they don't 

2784
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:04,340
know that would be useful.
You know,

2785
02:25:04,341 --> 02:25:06,620
now there's some presuppositions that go
along with that.

2786
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:07,453
It's like you have to be willing to meet
the other person in the space between 

2787
02:25:11,301 --> 02:25:15,350
cultures and you have to know how to 
operate in this space between cultures.

2788
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:17,660
And that's part of the hero myth.
By the way,

2789
02:25:17,661 --> 02:25:18,494
if you're a hero of the right form,
you knew how to operate in this space 

2790
02:25:21,621 --> 02:25:24,430
between cultures.
Well then how do you operate there?

2791
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,383
Well,
I think we know what makes cultures 

2792
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:33,910
rich.
Trust what makes trust possible.

2793
02:25:34,030 --> 02:25:37,420
Honesty,
you know you want natural resources.

2794
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:40,480
There's nothing more valuable than trust
and honesty.

2795
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:44,740
Why is the world poor?
Corruption?

2796
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:46,353
That's why all the poor countries,
almost all the poor countries are 

2797
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:49,954
corrupt.
Part of the reason they're poor is 

2798
02:25:51,051 --> 02:25:52,990
because they're corrupt.
Now,

2799
02:25:52,991 --> 02:25:53,711
you know,
you might say,

2800
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:56,290
well,
are the western countries so uncorrupt?

2801
02:25:56,670 --> 02:25:59,020
It's like,
well they've got their problems,

2802
02:25:59,021 --> 02:26:02,380
but generally the answer is they're not 
corrupt.

2803
02:26:02,770 --> 02:26:04,720
So [inaudible] bay is a good example of 
that,

2804
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:06,790
you know,
because when Ebay first emerged,

2805
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:09,580
people thought,
you send me John,

2806
02:26:09,581 --> 02:26:12,880
could I send you a check that bounces?
So that's the end of Ebay,

2807
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:15,940
right?
So these third party,

2808
02:26:16,270 --> 02:26:17,103
I can't remember what they're called,
agents set themselves up so that you 

2809
02:26:20,561 --> 02:26:21,394
could pay them a fraction of the price 
and they would get the check and the 

2810
02:26:25,421 --> 02:26:28,580
product validate them and ship them off 
and you know,

2811
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:32,740
they'd take 10 percent or whatever.
There's a particular name for people who

2812
02:26:32,741 --> 02:26:34,570
do that,
like it's a profession.

2813
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:35,463
Anyways,
what happened was the average rate of 

2814
02:26:37,031 --> 02:26:39,400
honesty on Ebay was so high that that 
was useless.

2815
02:26:39,401 --> 02:26:43,000
It's like the default was I won't screw 
you.

2816
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:47,320
And that was between strangers who had 
never met an even more weirdly.

2817
02:26:47,321 --> 02:26:49,570
We're never going to engage in another 
transaction.

2818
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:50,913
So what that meant was that Ebay all of 
a sudden became insanely valuable 

2819
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:58,090
because people would trade property now,
re reputation markers soon evolved,

2820
02:26:58,660 --> 02:26:59,493
but the d,
and I do believe that in the west the 

2821
02:27:01,091 --> 02:27:01,924
default is you won't screw me now if 
that means that I can trust your 

2822
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:11,740
persona.
If the default is you will screw me,

2823
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:12,753
then I'm a barrel of snakes and you're a
barrel of snakes and we will never get 

2824
02:27:15,761 --> 02:27:16,430
anywhere

2825
02:27:16,430 --> 02:27:17,500
exactly.
But this is,

2826
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:18,383
I mean,
if we talked about the state of the 

2827
02:27:19,821 --> 02:27:20,654
world,
most of humanity does not live in the 

2828
02:27:23,871 --> 02:27:27,390
west where the default assumption is I 
can probably trust this person.

2829
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:28,573
What are the lessons to learn from what?
From what you're arguing and from and 

2830
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:35,510
from where you've extrapolated from your
experience or these contexts.

2831
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:36,401
Okay.
I mean,

2832
02:27:36,401 --> 02:27:37,234
I can only speak about that at the most 
general level because what to do in any 

2833
02:27:42,791 --> 02:27:43,624
particular circumstance.
That's the sort of problem I deal with 

2834
02:27:45,221 --> 02:27:47,170
in my clinical practice all the time.
It's like,

2835
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:50,140
here's this insanely complicated 
circumstance.

2836
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:54,280
It's usually has nothing to do with 
mental illness is just the per person is

2837
02:27:54,281 --> 02:27:56,950
caught in something ridiculously 
complex.

2838
02:27:56,951 --> 02:27:59,920
Like you know,
their aunt is sick at home,

2839
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:03,100
their husband just lost his job and they
have an illness.

2840
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:04,080
It's like,
oh my God,

2841
02:28:04,081 --> 02:28:05,080
it's horrible.
You know,

2842
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:06,940
is it,
are they mentally ill?

2843
02:28:06,941 --> 02:28:08,770
It's no,
it's just awful.

2844
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:10,293
So how do you weave your way through an 
awful situation while the particulars 

2845
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:14,913
matter a lot.
And so you have to do strategic 

2846
02:28:17,111 --> 02:28:19,360
analysis,
paying attention to the details,

2847
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,250
but okay,
so that's the particular.

2848
02:28:22,251 --> 02:28:25,580
So what's the general case?
While the general case is

2849
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:27,093
maybe

2850
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:31,683
don't falsify your relationship with 
being to the degree that you can manage 

2851
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:37,624
that.
Now one of the things that I tell my 

2852
02:28:39,491 --> 02:28:40,324
students is

2853
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:44,780
try solving a problem,
fixing it,

2854
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:47,960
not trying to solve a problem,
but you know,

2855
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:53,230
if you're gonna fix it and you can fix 
it and it's a problem and you know,

2856
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:55,160
it's a problem.
Okay.

2857
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:55,994
So there's like a preconditioning.
So let's say there's a bunch of things 

2858
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:01,650
around you that bug you and you think,
hmm,

2859
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:04,010
those things bug me.
Why?

2860
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:07,040
But you don't know.
But they bug you and you might think,

2861
02:29:07,041 --> 02:29:09,350
well,
is one of those things that bugged me,

2862
02:29:09,351 --> 02:29:12,750
something I could fix,
you might think well On.

2863
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:14,820
And there's another part which is 
normally,

2864
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:17,840
could I fix it?
I would fix it because you can think,

2865
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:20,660
well I could fix that,
but I won't know if you're being honest.

2866
02:29:20,661 --> 02:29:21,740
You know,
he just won't do it.

2867
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:24,350
But there's often something that you 
would fix.

2868
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:26,600
Start there,
fix it,

2869
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:30,170
and then try again.
Try to see if there's something else you

2870
02:29:30,171 --> 02:29:31,004
could fix.

2871
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:33,320
Like.
So if you're going to beat the lie,

2872
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:38,890
you know you have to start with what you
can do and you start locally like right,

2873
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:41,060
right.
Locally.

2874
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:44,840
And you can tell it's the right amount 
of local because it bugs you.

2875
02:29:45,770 --> 02:29:49,760
You could fix it and you will fix it.
So perfect.

2876
02:29:49,761 --> 02:29:52,340
That's your problem.
That's exactly your problem right there.

2877
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:53,263
Fix it.
Well then everything shifts a little 

2878
02:29:55,071 --> 02:29:56,210
bit.
Everything around you is just.

2879
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:59,090
The balance between chaos and order is a
little better.

2880
02:29:59,570 --> 02:30:00,403
Right?
Well the same thing applies to your 

2881
02:30:01,131 --> 02:30:02,300
speech.
It's like,

2882
02:30:03,350 --> 02:30:05,030
okay,
I have to lie here because otherwise I'm

2883
02:30:05,031 --> 02:30:06,380
going to get killed.
It's like,

2884
02:30:06,381 --> 02:30:07,214
okay,
well maybe that's not the place to 

2885
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:10,940
start.
You know the baby that's just foolhardy.

2886
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,313
Okay.
What I say that you should lie in that 

2887
02:30:13,311 --> 02:30:16,400
situation,
I would say I can't tell because I'm not

2888
02:30:16,401 --> 02:30:18,470
in the situation and the particular 
matter,

2889
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:19,610
so I don't know what to say.

2890
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:20,473
That situation might be so awful that 
there's nothing you can do that isn't 

2891
02:30:22,881 --> 02:30:25,370
awful.
How about in your own home?

2892
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:28,940
How but in relationship to yourself,
it's like,

2893
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:29,893
how about you start fixing up the little
micro lies that you leave lying around 

2894
02:30:32,871 --> 02:30:33,704
everywhere.
Then it's gonna make you tougher and 

2895
02:30:35,691 --> 02:30:36,524
more formidable.
You keep practicing that for like 15 

2896
02:30:38,931 --> 02:30:40,160
years,
you know,

2897
02:30:40,161 --> 02:30:45,161
and then maybe you'll be able to start 
to address some of the larger problems.

2898
02:30:45,981 --> 02:30:46,814
Maybe you'll even start to understand 
what the larger problems are because 

2899
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:51,800
that's a problem with prematurely trying
to do too much.

2900
02:30:51,801 --> 02:30:52,580
Right?
It's like,

2901
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:53,840
oh,
is that really the problem?

2902
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:56,450
And what makes you think you'll make it 
better rather than worse?

2903
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:59,930
It's got to pick the right size problem.
So I would say,

2904
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:03,170
you know,
let's start with little weights and work

2905
02:31:03,171 --> 02:31:06,440
yourself up and that's how you develop 
competence anyways,

2906
02:31:06,441 --> 02:31:07,274
right?
Like if you're going to figure out how 

2907
02:31:08,991 --> 02:31:09,824
to set things straight,
you might as well start where you can 

2908
02:31:13,521 --> 02:31:16,310
set them straight and you might think,
well that's trivial.

2909
02:31:16,311 --> 02:31:18,920
It's not trivial.
You might think it's trivial.

2910
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:21,990
You have no idea how important it might 
be that you straighten up your,

2911
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:25,620
your relationship with your,
your wife or your son.

2912
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,990
You may have no idea what that might 
lead to.

2913
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:29,243
I mean,
just think of what Stella and his 

2914
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:31,500
relationship with his father led to.

2915
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:34,740
It was awful.
You know,

2916
02:31:34,741 --> 02:31:38,010
their salad,
he killed like $60 million people.

2917
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:43,070
His father was a brute,
so that seemed reasonably important.

2918
02:31:43,111 --> 02:31:46,110
Maybe he shouldn't have been a brute.
So.

2919
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:49,260
So you know how horrible things can be 
if you do things wrong.

2920
02:31:49,261 --> 02:31:49,711
It's like,
well,

2921
02:31:49,711 --> 02:31:51,390
how good can they be if you do things 
right?

2922
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:53,250
You don't know.
Try starting.

2923
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:56,540
It's like see what happens.
My experience has been like I'm.

2924
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:58,223
My experience has been that to the 
degree that I'm able to speak carefully 

2925
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:09,180
and I do speak carefully and I don't 
really care about the consequences.

2926
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:12,300
It isn't that it isn't,
that they don't matter.

2927
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:16,350
It's that I'm not speaking to produce a 
consequence.

2928
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,753
I'm just trying to say what seems to me 
to be the case and that for me that's 

2929
02:32:22,231 --> 02:32:27,231
been incredibly ridiculously.
I'm practically useful,

2930
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:28,973
insanely useful.
Like it's opened doors that I would've 

2931
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:33,780
never dreamed of opening.
So,

2932
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:34,653
and you know,
in my professional life it's produced 

2933
02:32:36,151 --> 02:32:36,984
all sorts of opportunities and it's been
a real aid in my private life to it in 

2934
02:32:40,381 --> 02:32:43,760
my professional life.
It's not like I don't make mistakes like

2935
02:32:43,761 --> 02:32:45,870
I,
I don't think that I am.

2936
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:51,000
I would never think of myself as 
fundamentally a good person.

2937
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:53,850
I think maybe I'm fundamentally a bad 
person,

2938
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:55,710
but because our,
you know,

2939
02:32:55,711 --> 02:32:58,560
I have dark thoughts and,
and I,

2940
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:01,110
I'm quite temperamental.
And so like

2941
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:05,860
anyways,
you know,

2942
02:33:05,870 --> 02:33:08,870
I do what I can to deal with all that 
and I don't do it perfectly.

2943
02:33:08,871 --> 02:33:13,070
And I slide backwards mostly by 
avoidance,

2944
02:33:13,071 --> 02:33:15,040
you know,
I don't always stay on top of the things

2945
02:33:15,050 --> 02:33:15,970
I should stay on top of,

2946
02:33:16,050 --> 02:33:16,883
but

2947
02:33:18,610 --> 02:33:23,610
to the degree that I've been able to 
adhere to this mode of being,

2948
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:29,110
I can't think of a single thing that's 
happened that hasn't been

2949
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:34,590
like in some ways beyond my 
expectations.

2950
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:36,053
So.
And it's really fun talking to this 

2951
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:38,940
students,
you know,

2952
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:39,773
because it's fun with the lectures 
because when I'm talking about the 

2953
02:33:42,331 --> 02:33:46,350
mythological material and I can sort of 
sort out the stories,

2954
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,690
I can just see lights going on 
everywhere.

2955
02:33:48,691 --> 02:33:49,910
It's like click,
you know,

2956
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:50,753
you can see,
it's like you can tell when someone has 

2957
02:33:53,041 --> 02:33:53,874
an insight,
I think they opened their eyes a bit 

2958
02:33:54,721 --> 02:33:55,554
more detail.
Maybe that's it because it's a bit of a 

2959
02:33:56,401 --> 02:34:00,120
surprise so you can detect it and it is 
like light going on.

2960
02:34:00,121 --> 02:34:01,140
And so,
you know,

2961
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:01,974
I'll walk someone suit three,
say through this Egyptian story and 

2962
02:34:04,441 --> 02:34:06,360
audience and they just go pick to click,
click,

2963
02:34:06,361 --> 02:34:07,194
click,
click.

2964
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:08,820
It's fun,
it's really fun.

2965
02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:10,920
So,
and you know,

2966
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:11,783
people seem to respond to it positively,
which I've always been completely 

2967
02:34:14,971 --> 02:34:16,510
surprised about,
you know,

2968
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:18,700
I can't,
that I've been able to lecture about the

2969
02:34:18,701 --> 02:34:21,180
things that I lecture about without,
you know,

2970
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:24,670
running mightily afoul of something,
you know,

2971
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:25,563
because my classes are quite different 
than the standard psychology class or 

2972
02:34:31,261 --> 02:34:33,890
the standard university class.
They're very different and.

2973
02:34:34,170 --> 02:34:35,003
But that,
but I don't know so far it seems to be 

2974
02:34:38,641 --> 02:34:41,310
working.
So which is a surprise to me.

2975
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:43,843
So.
So that's what I would say to people is 

2976
02:34:47,151 --> 02:34:52,151
like select the domain in which you can 
act straightened it up first and that'll

2977
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,490
transform things a bit.
Like,

2978
02:34:55,491 --> 02:34:56,420
it'll,
it'll,

2979
02:34:56,510 --> 02:34:57,343
you put your house in order,
then you can start to put your town in 

2980
02:35:00,381 --> 02:35:02,570
order or maybe your street or maybe your
neighbor.

2981
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:03,890
God only knows,
you know,

2982
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:07,640
start where you can start.
And you might think,

2983
02:35:07,641 --> 02:35:09,710
well that's what's that.
Well,

2984
02:35:09,711 --> 02:35:11,870
it's nothing you can wave a placard in 
the street about,

2985
02:35:11,871 --> 02:35:14,120
which is a good thing that's like 
praying in public,

2986
02:35:14,121 --> 02:35:17,570
you know,
this is more like praying in private fix

2987
02:35:17,571 --> 02:35:20,540
up what you can fix up and see what 
happens.

2988
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:23,420
And I don't think that there's anything 
that's more powerful than that.
