1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,770
Dr. Jordan Peterson.
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,050
Good morning.
Thank you so much for coming in.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,183
You're,
you're developing this enormous power 

4
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,270
and reach you.
Is it the heavy burden for it?

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,280
Well,
it,

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,560
it's heavy and light at the same time.
You know,

7
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,910
it's,
it's constant.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,780
I generally don't know what I'm doing 
day to day until that day.

9
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:19,614
And I have people managing my schedule 
and I'm busy enough so that I pretty 

10
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,964
much attend to the next thing.
But the responsibility of getting into 

11
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,220
all these heads and you are influencing 
people significantly,

12
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,410
aren't you?
Well,

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,303
I guess I take solace in the fact that 
so many thousands of people now have 

14
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,664
written to me and also talk to me to say
that things are better for them because 

15
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,650
they've been trying to do some of the 
things that I suggest in my lectures.

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,160
And so it is a heavy responsibility 
when,

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,083
when you have influence of that sort,
but it lightens it when you also have 

18
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,380
evidence suggesting that it seems to be 
doing people a lot of good,

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
you're changing lives.
Uh,

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,890
that seems to be the case.
So I been lost.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,200
Well,
I would say there were six people in the

22
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,240
audience last night I was talking in 
Melbourne.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,580
I would say there were six,
maybe there were more,

24
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,980
but there were at least six,
so half a dozen.

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,990
And they were young men who told me 
that.

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,120
That that's,
that's what they said.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,070
Yeah,
yeah,

28
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,600
yeah.
How do you feel about that?

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,573
Okay.

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,503
Breaks me up.
Why haven't said it's a very positive 

31
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,430
thing you've done what?
What do you mean that breaks you up?

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,293
Okay.

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,153
Well,
it's sad that there's so many people in 

34
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,450
that
state of crisis,

35
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,040
you know,
and they don't need

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,050
that much encouragement.
That's the thing.

37
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,043
So it's sad that it only takes that much
encouragement to make that much 

38
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,764
difference.
There's a lot of lost people in the 

39
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,014
world,
so it's a good thing to be able to help 

40
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,600
that.
It's overwhelming.

41
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,850
What can tell that you're very emotional
about it?

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,400
Yeah.
Well it's really something,

43
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,234
you know what table?
I hadn't thought much about what had 

44
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,990
happened last night,
but you know,

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,693
I probably 500 people lined up after the
talk and most of them say the same 

46
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,740
thing.
You know,

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,590
about a quarter of them say,
look,

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,960
you're putting into words things I 
already knew.

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,880
I always knew,
but I didn't know how to say.

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Just like,
well,

51
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:19,914
that's what archetipal stories do.
And I guess that's what articulate 

52
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:22,921
people do,
you know?

53
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,754
So that's a good thing.
But then the other three quarters of 

54
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,990
them say some variant of,
of,

55
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,790
of,
of,

56
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,820
you know,
my life has been turned around.

57
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,560
They say I was addicted or I was 
drinking too much,

58
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,470
or I wasn't moving ahead in my 
relationship with my girlfriend,

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,440
I wasn't getting along with my family.
I didn't have any direction in life.

60
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,180
I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious 
or any number of variants of those.

61
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,014
And I've been trying to put into 
practice what you've been talking about 

62
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,710
in your youtube lectures and podcasts 
and,

63
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,050
and it's really helped my turn my life 
around.

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,490
Thank you.
I'm just like,

65
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,660
yeah,
give you something.

66
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,060
You feel Fred John about that?

67
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,770
Well,
no,

68
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,730
I wouldn't say exactly that.
I seem to be able to handle this.

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,370
It's been going on a long time now.
It's,

70
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,293
it's been 18 months and I would say in 
many ways now it's better than it was 

71
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,450
because at the beginning,
especially when I got,

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,060
when I put my hat in the political ring 
let's say,

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,073
because I felt that the Canadian 
politicians had overstepped their 

74
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,710
boundaries.
Um,

75
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,000
you know,
my job was threatened and quite severely

76
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,910
and I thought I might lose my clinical 
license as well.

77
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,490
And um,
things were up in the air and a big way.

78
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,450
Those are a lot more gender.
I was my refusal,

79
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,430
my stated refusal to abide by the,
by the requirement that,

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,490
that I modify my language in a certain 
manner that I felt was inappropriate.

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
Oh,
it felt it was inappropriate of the 

82
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,360
government to demand that I modify my 
language.

83
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,050
The government has no right to intrude 
on people's lives to that degree.

84
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,090
It's very,
very dangerous when that happens.

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,770
And so anyways,
there was,

86
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,260
I've been in one scandal after another 
in Canada,

87
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,470
like seriously,
like nonstop for 18 months.

88
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,870
The last one,
just two days ago,

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,040
I was at Queens University in Kingston 
and there was a big demonstration,

90
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,240
there was a very eerie occurrence.
They arrested a woman who was carrying a

91
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,740
garage for God's sake,
you know,

92
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,743
and that was not good.
The Queen's university thing was not 

93
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,350
good.
We were in a hall,

94
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,720
it was kind of like a church that's 
hall.

95
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,554
It's what it looked like.
It was lined with stained glass windows 

96
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,920
and uh,
probably 20 of them.

97
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,610
And there was a protester had climbed up
in the window,

98
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,444
well of all 20 windows,
probably five or six feet off the 

99
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,560
ground.
And they were seven feet high,

100
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,020
these windows and they were pounding on 
them and forcefully,

101
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,150
forcefully enough in one case to break 
the window.

102
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,270
And so there was 900 of us inside and it
was,

103
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,730
we were surrounded by this group that 
were pounding on the windows and yelling

104
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,190
and pounding on the doors.
And um,

105
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,450
it was,
and you know,

106
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,030
you could see against the stained glass,
you could see these shouted,

107
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,760
we forms pounding away.
And it was,

108
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,170
it was very eerie.
No one.

109
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,570
And no one in that hall will ever forget
that experience.

110
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,060
Why would they trying to get in while 
the garage?

111
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,790
Why the,
it sounds like height.

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,840
He's at height.
Some of it was hate for sure.

113
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:21,760
What are the hedge?
Because they,

114
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,450
because of who they imagine I might be.
I guess that's part of it.

115
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,980
Um,
you know,

116
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,550
it's,
it's,

117
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,020
it's easy to hate someone who's been 
caricatured and so,

118
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,190
but there's more to it than that.
I have been very forceful,

119
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,680
let's say in my criticisms of the 
radical left,

120
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,170
not only in Canada,
but in the West in general,

121
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,093
not critical enough in my estimation.
So I hold no stock whatsoever for the 

122
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,384
radical leftists.
I'm absolutely appalled that they are 

123
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,414
the force they are in the universities.
And I do believe that in many ways the 

124
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,684
universities have done more harm in 
society than good over the last 20 

125
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,194
years.
And I say that you with a fair bit of 

126
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,210
regret because I've been obviously 
associated with university since 1993.

127
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,143
It's a really easy thing.
I sometimes enjoy dealing with the 

128
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:08,160
radical lift in universities.
I think you're going to grow up,

129
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,473
you're going to get through this.
And I enjoy the challenge and the drama 

130
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:13,500
and the,
yeah,

131
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,350
it's a challenge of youth saying you're 
wrong.

132
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,593
I'm right.
And I know I'm right because I'm 20 and 

133
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:20,064
I know everything.

134
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,590
Well,
it's not the students so much.

135
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,660
I'm concerned about staff.
Is it?

136
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,823
Oh yeah,
it's the staff and the administrators 

137
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,020
and no,
it's not the students.

138
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,740
I mean,
look,

139
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,570
I go,
I've been protested against,

140
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,970
I watched the protesters and most of the
time,

141
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,270
the vast majority of them are young 
people whose,

142
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,780
whose desire to have a positive 
influence in the world is channeled into

143
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,580
this particular political expression at 
the moment.

144
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:44,414
But so many of them are manipulated by 
the faculty members and there's no 

145
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,550
excuse for that.
And what they're doing is,

146
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,620
is far more dangerous than it looks.

147
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,610
Why do young men need you?

148
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,400
Well,
first of all,

149
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,234
you know,
it's not,

150
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,193
I would say it's not just young men.
Part of that's an artifact of the fact 

151
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,820
that most of the people who watch 
youtube,

152
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,320
our young men,
um,

153
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,430
but,
but I,

154
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,110
I won't evade the question.
I mean,

155
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,423
because see to some degree,
maturation among men is voluntary 

156
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,060
process.
It's not so voluntary for women.

157
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,923
They have to grow up fast.
They have a lot of things to do before 

158
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:19,770
they hit 30.
Yeah.

159
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,450
With men it can,
it can take longer.

160
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,760
And they need a call to adventure,
let's say.

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,660
And they need to call to responsibility 
and they need to be,

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,553
they need to,
to be initiated into responsibility and 

163
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:36,460
to have a case made for its utility.
And so I'm saying,

164
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,294
look,
it's better to be adult than to be a 

165
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,580
child.
It's better.

166
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,950
It's better to be in control of your own
destiny.

167
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,903
There's a place for you in the world.
The world would be lesser if you don't 

168
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:49,360
take your place in it,
that you have a responsibility to bear,

169
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,194
to sort out your education,
to straighten out your life and to 

170
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,040
become who you are.
Grow the hell up,

171
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,270
grow up and,
and,

172
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,850
and for,
for reasons that are positive for you,

173
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,890
positive for your family,
positive for everyone.

174
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,743
So he's buddies,
this generation lost [inaudible] 

175
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,140
desperate.
They,

176
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,890
they're clinging to what you're saying 
and doing in a desperate,

177
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm not criticizing what you're saying 
or doing but they need it.

178
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,390
They need it desperately.
Why?

179
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,730
I think that I think that every 
generation needs a message that,

180
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,860
that that supports maturation and 
responsibility.

181
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,870
I think that we've done a bad job as a 
culture of putting that message forward.

182
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:32,871
So to me since the mid 1960s our young 
people have been fed a never ending diet

183
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:36,960
of rights and impulsive freedoms,
something like that.

184
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,850
And that leaves a hole because most of 
the meaning that people,

185
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,230
people managing their lives and so that 
would be the meaning that you can offset

186
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:50,080
against the tragedy of life that comes 
from adopting responsibility and,

187
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:50,914
and carrying a load.
Like human beings in some sense are 

188
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,530
designed for a load and the heavier the 
load better.

189
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,693
It's,
it's one of the things that gives you 

190
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,983
this,
this proclivity among psychologists to 

191
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,000
attempt to facilitate self esteem,
which is a word I don't care much for.

192
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,120
I think that self respect is a much 
better term.

193
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,180
I think you develop self respect by 
carrying a responsibility.

194
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,320
I,

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,153
I feel very lucky to have been born in 
this linked to essentially a decent 

196
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,094
country.
Uh,

197
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,933
does follow a lot of what happens in the
United States and I get to that in a 

198
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:20,754
moment,
but I was talking to some welfare 

199
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,680
workers,
police,

200
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:27,681
salvation army yesterday signed to me,
they think society is becoming an end,

201
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,004
particularly the younger the age group,
which hawking is becoming more 

202
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,940
aggressive,
more cynical,

203
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,550
more angry.
You agree with that?

204
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,384
And if so,
why?

205
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,493
Well,
I don't think the statistics bear that 

206
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,690
out because what we've seen overall over
the last,

207
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,350
especially the last 20 years is a 
remarkable decline in violent crime.

208
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,270
I do think that there might be an 
epidemic more of aimlessness and,

209
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,130
and,
and depression and anxiety,

210
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:53,964
that sort of thing.
And I think that that's partly because 

211
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,090
the case for growing up is not made 
well.

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,980
And,
and,

213
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,780
and because we're also so cynical about 
our own societies,

214
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:04,614
you know,
I was in Amsterdam month ago talking to 

215
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,494
a group of well placed intellectuals.
They are all friends of Theo van Gogh 

216
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,100
who was,
who was killed in,

217
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,070
in,
in Amsterdam about 15 years ago.

218
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,660
It was stabbed and there said that 
embarrassment about the Dutch culture is

219
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:22,890
rampant in their society.
I that just makes my jaw drop cause I go

220
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,300
to Holland and I think,
my God,

221
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,100
this is such an amazing place.
These people,

222
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,100
they scrape this country out of the 
bottom of the ocean.

223
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,410
They built dikes to hold back the waves.
It's,

224
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,120
it's free.
It's,

225
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,130
it's liberal,
it's,

226
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,000
it's compassionate,
it's orderly,

227
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,690
it's beautiful embarrassed.
They're embarrassed by it because of its

228
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,760
tyrannical,
patriarchal nature.

229
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,560
It's like,
well who are you comparing it to?

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,560
It's like what are we comparing our 
societies to?

231
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,080
Where do you want to live it on,
on,

232
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,360
on the planet or in time,
anywhere,

233
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,910
but in the west,
not if you have any sense.

234
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,013
You've been,
you've sort of been described as a 

235
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,440
warrior against political correctness.
Is that fit?

236
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,990
Yeah.
Tell me about this.

237
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,824
And our national carrier,
Quantas got some attention earlier this 

238
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,853
week and I was thinking about this.
I knew you were coming in and that they 

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,950
were taking advice from a diversity 
group that that's a bad idea,

240
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,383
bad idea.
And I wanted to ban words like guys and 

241
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,380
chairman,
husband and wife,

242
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,243
um,
replaceable replace words like mankind 

243
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,870
and chairman.
What's your reaction to that?

244
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,160
I think that it would be better if 
people tried to solve some real problems

245
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,790
instead of playing these idiot diversity
games.

246
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,480
I think that everyone who plays identity
politics,

247
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,250
whether they play it on the right or the
left,

248
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,890
is going to pay for it in ways they can 
hardly imagine.

249
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,210
It's a very counterproductive way of 
dividing up the world.

250
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,373
It's an,
it's impossible to come to a peaceful 

251
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,490
solution in the identity politics 
universe.

252
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,860
Even the identity politics types 
themselves,

253
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,620
they've run into this problem they call 
intersectionality,

254
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,741
right?
So,

255
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,574
okay,
so you classify people by race and by 

256
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,520
sex,
let's say.

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,370
So,
and,

258
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:02,020
and seek for equity along those 
dimensions.

259
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,221
But then,
well,

260
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,830
what about the intersection between 
those dimensions?

261
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,810
So you,
you have enough,

262
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,190
uh,
um,

263
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,030
uh,
ethnic minorities in your,

264
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,000
in your organization.
Let's say you match by population,

265
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,230
which is a foolish way of doing it.

266
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,470
But you do that and maybe you're matched
by sex,

267
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,690
but then what,
what about the intersection between race

268
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,890
and sex?
Well,

269
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,380
and then what about the intersection 
between race,

270
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,970
sex,
ethnicity?

271
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,690
Then you could add social class to that.
Then you could add social proclivity.

272
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,853
Then you could add attractiveness.
There's never ending way of dividing 

273
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:39,190
people up into groups and you can't 
equalize across all those ways.

274
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,053
It's just technically not possible.
Do you think people need to a stand on 

275
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,540
issues like this and when an airline,
like quantas makes these decisions,

276
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,970
do they need to stand against it?
Do they need to boy clothes,

277
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,813
I need to do that sort of thing?
I think they need to understand it at a 

278
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,434
deeper level.
It's like we have to decide if we're 

279
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,624
going to divide people up.
If we think that dividing people up 

280
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,510
primarily by the group identity is a 
good idea and it's not,

281
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,010
it's a bad idea.

282
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,180
It will lead to,
uh,

283
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,080
an enhancement of our tribal 
proclivities.

284
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,590
And I don't think that if you're a,
an advocate of peace that you would push

285
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,360
and advocate for our further division 
into tribal entities.

286
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,130
It's a,
it's not wise,

287
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,350
is this transit.
When we move through this,

288
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,340
we'll see.
It's been not transient in the past.

289
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,200
It's caused tremendous troubles in the 
past.

290
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,040
This is another reason why I'm not a fan
of the radical leftists.

291
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,490
So the,
the radical left ideologies were,

292
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,370
were murderous in their expression 
throughout the 20th century.

293
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,353
I mentioned earlier,
this country follows a lot of the US 

294
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,820
trends,
good and bad.

295
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,780
We're a little bit behind,
but it can be fashion.

296
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,850
Well,
what do we need to be alert to?

297
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,220
What do we need to be aware of?
What we need to avoid?

298
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,433
We need to,
we need to be alert to the benefits of 

299
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,930
the societies that we now inhabit.

300
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,690
We need to be grateful for their 
existence and,

301
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,390
and note very carefully the unlikelihood
of their continued success.

302
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,423
Now,
I don't understand how we managed it in 

303
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,384
the West.
We have societies where the default 

304
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,450
assumption between human beings is 
trust.

305
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,823
I do not understand how we manage that 
because there's so many ways that you 

306
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,610
can be betrayed by someone,
especially if you don't know them.

307
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,660
How do you set up a society where the 
typical interaction between strangers is

308
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,310
straight?
Oh,

309
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,050
how many societies in the world are like
that?

310
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,680
Like 30 40 something like that?
How did that ever happen?

311
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,263
We don't know.
And it's an ongoing miracle and we 

312
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,394
should do everything we can not to 
disrupt it because the alternative to 

313
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,130
that generous trust,
that courageous trust,

314
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,580
which is unbelievably productive,
is ruled by thug.

315
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,620
And that's the rule in most of the 
world.

316
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,450
So do you have optimism or not for the 
future?

317
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,190
I think we're in a time of extreme 
chaos.

318
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,400
Things could go unbelievably well if we 
were careful.

319
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,890
There's so many good things going on in 
the world right now.

320
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,870
They're almost miraculous.
So,

321
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,560
for example,
between the year 2000 and 2012 the level

322
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:10,394
of absolute poverty in the world was cut
by 50% that was the fastest rate of 

323
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,740
improvement by a large margin in human 
history.

324
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:19,550
It was three years faster than the most 
optimistic projections had suggested.

325
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,073
There's hundreds of thousands of people 
a week now being being pulled into the 

326
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,184
electrical power grid.
Almost everyone has access to almost 

327
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:31,250
infinite computational power and all the
educational resources that go along with

328
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,084
that.
We're wiping out most transmissible 

329
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:34,664
diseases.
The fastest growing economies in the 

330
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:39,200
world are in sub Saharan Africa.
Like there are a lot of things.

331
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,890
There's no starvation in China.
There's a huge middle class in China and

332
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,410
India.
These things are absolutely miraculous.

333
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,543
So,
and God only knows what we could 

334
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,630
accomplish if we got our act together in
the next 20 years.

335
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,040
I,
you know,

336
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,030
the sky's the limit.
So,

337
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:53,864
but we're playing very foolish games in 
the west and we could bring the house 

338
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,090
down around us.
So we'll see.

339
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,850
Thank you so much for coming in.
Good luck with a burden.

340
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,183
Oh,
thanks very much for the invitation and 

341
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,160
for the interview,
Jordan B.

342
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,821
Peterson,
12 rules,

343
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:10,010
falafel,
and added to chaos.
