1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,940
So,
um,

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,153
last time we talked,
I started to walk you through the 

3
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:31,684
nervous system a little bit and uh,
we started with the monkey business 

4
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,304
illusion and one of the things that's 
really remarkable about the monkey 

5
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,964
business illusion is that,
and change blindness experiments in 

6
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:47,430
general is that they demonstrate to you 
just to what degree you,

7
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,880
you could either describe yourself as 
blind or focused.

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,030
And I think focused is actually better 
than blind.

9
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,163
You know,
like a laser beam doesn't cover much 

10
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,024
area,
but it really illuminates what it 

11
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:03,130
strikes and people are sort of like that
were really beamed into a single point.

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,683
And there's something metaphysically 
spectacular about that I think because 

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,673
that single point that were narrowed 
down to is in some thing some sense the 

14
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:16,730
thing that rates the world,
you know,

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,400
because as we interact with the world,
we're able to turn it one way or another

16
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,050
in all sorts of complicated ways.

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,930
And I mean I know our powers and doing 
so are obviously constrained to a,

18
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,580
to a substantial degree.
But by the same token,

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,230
that focal point of concentration 
enables us to interact with the world.

20
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:39,220
And then at least seemingly to change it
according to our will,

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,070
which is,
you know,

22
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:41,904
it's like we take a future that's 
potential and we interact with are the 

23
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,484
focal point and then it transforms 
itself into a past that's in some sense 

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,170
fixed and real.
So that's pretty strange.

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,790
So I guess you know,
you wouldn't,

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,760
you don't want to underestimate the 
utility of a point.

27
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,373
So I want to talk to you a little bit 
first about what you're blind to and 

28
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:03,964
then what this.
Much of what the consequences of that 

29
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:11,050
are.
So this here is a little diagram of a,

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,860
of a computer,
believe it or not,

31
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,730
conceptual diagram of a computer and a,
it's predicated on.

32
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,720
I'll tell you a quick story.
If I've told you this story,

33
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:26,554
please stop me.
But I don't think I've told you guys 

34
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,744
this story.

35
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,683
So one day back in about 1987,
I was working on my computer and I was 

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,080
typing something
long essay in doth.

37
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:41,914
And you really had to backup in those 
days because the programs didn't do any 

38
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:46,384
backup for you.
And so if the thing shut off and you 

39
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,740
hadn't been super careful,
you're just going to lose all of it.

40
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,380
So that's what happened.
I was typing away,

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,290
computer went off and so I had an 
emotional reaction to that right now,

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,773
an emotional reaction.
That is kind of an interesting event 

43
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,164
because I would say that you're not even
working with the computer until it 

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,473
quits.
And the reason I would say that is 

45
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,400
because if you think about it,
when the computer's functioning,

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,893
the fact that it's an extraordinarily 
complicated device is basically 

47
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,104
irrelevant to you.
What you're working with roughly 

48
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,820
speaking is the screen,
but not really.

49
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,820
Not even the screen you're working with.
Maybe the phrase or the or even the word

50
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,570
that's presented on the screen,
you know you're typing the word phrase,

51
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,700
sentence,
paragraph,

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,773
essay,
and only out pass that domain of 

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,300
consideration.
Do you start thinking about the hardware

54
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,490
technology that underlies what you're 
doing?

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
You don't want to think about that at 
all.

56
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,100
When something's working,
you don't have to see it.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,340
And so that gives you a clue as to 
consciousness.

58
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
Consciousness is a,
an error detecting and correcting 

59
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,630
phenomena and you're not conscious of 
things that are going well,

60
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,560
so you know,
which might explain to some degree why a

61
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,100
lot of our life seems to be made up of 
suffering and all.

62
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,943
If things are going well,
it isn't exactly like you're happy if 

63
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,700
things are going well,
you just don't notice when they're going

64
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,534
well.
Sometimes if they unexpectedly go well 

65
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,624
then that makes you happy,
but otherwise it's just the same old 

66
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:20,650
thing.

67
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,740
Even if it's amazing.
No,

68
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,683
I was yesterday I was eating breakfast 
with my son and I was complaining about 

69
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:32,761
the fact that I have eat canned tuna 
because I don't really like fish,

70
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,190
but I have to eat fish for a variety of 
different reasons and I thought,

71
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,660
Jesus,
what are you complaining about?

72
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,650
I mean really you don't have tuna is 
like most things are like,

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,600
they're like small whales,
right?

74
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,210
They weighed 600 pounds.
They're impossible to count.

75
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:50,170
So there's some poor characters out 
there hauling in tuna,

76
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,363
which is impossible.
Then they have to clean them and freeze 

77
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,670
them and smoke them and can them and 
all.

78
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,504
I have to do is go to the store to pick 
up this can of tuna and then I can 

79
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,500
complain about it for breakfast.
It's like,

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,440
it's really quite staggering,
you know,

81
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:07,441
the fact that I can even ever eat a tuna
is a complete bloody miracle,

82
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,030
but it's not the sort of thing that 
makes me happy because,

83
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,253
you know,
I just expect that which is very 

84
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,590
pathetic,
but that's how it goes.

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,980
So anyways,
back to the computer.

86
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,623
So it stops working well and I would say
that's when I noticed the computer and 

87
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,960
there's nothing more annoying than 
noticing the computer when you're in the

88
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,560
middle of writing an essay because what 
the hell do you know about computers and

89
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,990
own nothing?
What are you going to do?

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
Turn it on and off.
Well,

91
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,200
that's a problem solving process.
Number one,

92
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,220
write.
It usually works,

93
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,054
thank God,
but then if it doesn't work well then 

94
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,470
you're into either the software or the 
hardware.

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,173
So anyways,
I turned it on and off of that didn't 

96
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,024
work.
And so then I turned on light to see if 

97
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,370
I could see,
you know,

98
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,870
if something had happened at the back of
it,

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,793
but the light didn't go on so then I 
thought a half the power of probably 

100
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,644
went out or I blew a fuse so went and 
looked to see if the fuse was burned 

101
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,220
out,
but it wasn't.

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,220
And then I noticed that all the power 
and the house was off and then I noticed

103
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,060
that I went outside down to the corner 
store to get something.

104
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,894
I don't remember what.
And then I knew when I went outside I 

105
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,234
noticed that all the street lights were 
off and then the entire power grid in 

106
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,014
Montreal and was on.
And then the entire power grid for like 

107
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,610
half of Quebec was out and a big chunk 
of eastern North America.

108
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,130
And do you know why have I told you this
story?

109
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,120
Good?
Because there was a solar flare.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,860
And so you know,
the,

111
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,930
the sun is a big hydrogen bomb,
right?

112
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,810
So I don't know if you guys know this is
cheerful piece of information for you if

113
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,644
you need to be cheered up.
But if you had to have a hydrogen bomb 

114
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,560
and you exploded it,
you know,

115
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,460
a hydrogen bomb has an atom,
bomb courts trigger pool.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,583
Did you guys know that?
You need to know that because it's 

117
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,980
important because an atom bomb is a big 
thing,

118
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,814
right?
But it's just a trigger for a hydrogen 

119
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,544
bomb.
So a hydrogen bomb is unimaginably 

120
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,033
bigger than that and Adam ball anyways.
If you blew a hydrogen bomb in the 

121
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,400
atmosphere over central North America,
you could probably wipe out maybe all of

122
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:07,640
the electronic equipment in the entire 
continent permanently.

123
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,490
Because what happens is when a hydrogen 
bomb goes off,

124
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:13,850
there's an electromagnetic burst and has
that propagates,

125
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,630
it'll hit your electronic equipment and 
propagate across the wires and produce a

126
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,840
big spike in current voltage,
I think.

127
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,110
And it'll just low it.
So your car was,

128
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,640
were your tractors won't work,
your work,

129
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,370
your cars won't work,
your computers won't work,

130
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,070
your satellites won't work.
It's done.

131
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,850
And also,
just to cheer you up even more,

132
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,590
back in the late 18 hundreds,
I think it was in the 18 sixties,

133
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,520
there was this,
uh,

134
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,470
uh Oh.

135
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,303
Let's go back to the sun.
So the sun is a big hydrogen bomb and 

136
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,160
now and then it freaks out and emits no,
a big solar flare,

137
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:53,690
which is something that's gone wrong on 
the sun and maybe it flows out the solar

138
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,880
flare almost to the,
you know,

139
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:56,920
the,
the,

140
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:59,210
uh,
orbit of mercury.

141
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,044
And then that burst of radiation comes 
zooming towards earth and then nine 

142
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,114
minutes later it hits and if it's a 
decent electromagnetic pulse than it'll 

143
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,390
wipe up the power grid and come back.
And that's what happened.

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,583
So,
so the reason my computer didn't work 

145
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,480
was because the son was misbehaving and 
so,

146
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:21,950
so I liked that it was very illuminating
to me because it just shows you how many

147
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:22,784
things have to be stacked on top of each
other working perfectly for some thing 

148
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:29,720
that you're doing to actually function.
So anyways,

149
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,440
back in the late 18 hundreds in the 18 
sixties,

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,433
there was a massive solar flare and it 
produced a burst of power on the 

151
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,460
telegraph lines and it lit some 
telegraph operators on fire.

152
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,460
And so this does happen.
It happens about once a century.

153
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,294
And we just missed one last year.
So while you're worrying about global 

154
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,680
warming,
you can be,

155
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,820
you can be considering the much higher 
probability that a solar flare,

156
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,400
we'll knock out all of our electronics 
and send us to like 1860.

157
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,000
So the point is,
is that a lot of,

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,073
first of all,
but there's a lot of things going on to 

159
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,030
make up an object that you don't detect 
with your vision.

160
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,080
You know,
like you never think,

161
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,990
well the reason that the computer works 
is because the sun is,

162
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,430
you know,
acting properly.

163
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,264
But it is of course the case that 
endless numbers of things have to be 

164
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,270
stabilized that you don't see.
And you might say,

165
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:22,140
well the sun isn't part of the computer,
but well that's wrong.

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,980
It's not part of the computer in some 
sense when it's behaving.

167
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,130
But as soon as it stops behaving,
it's instantly part of the computer,

168
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,290
you know?
And then so here we've got

169
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,960
no.
And then you might say,

170
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:34,794
well,
let's say the power hadn't gone out in 

171
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:36,894
the computer,
stopped working and well then you might 

172
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:42,720
think,
well I'll never buy that brand again.

173
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,630
You know,
and maybe the brand is associated with,

174
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,673
you know,
the operation in some country where 

175
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:53,370
corruption is rife and things are made 
in properly in the parts don't work very

176
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,330
well.
So you might think,

177
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,164
well I made a stupid purchase decision 
and of course that's connected to the 

178
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:01,020
political system of that place and the 
economy and you know,

179
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,063
and then weird little things can happen 
down at the micro level as well as the 

180
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,620
macro level.
So computers have now got.

181
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,250
So the chips have now got so small,
you know,

182
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,400
they have little wires in them,
right?

183
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,233
The chips,
the wires now so small that because of 

184
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,534
quantum uncertainty.
So quantum uncertainty basically tells 

185
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:21,120
you that if you can't really tell how,
where an electron is,

186
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,540
if you want to know how fast it's going 
and you can't tell how fast it's going,

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,030
if you want to know where it is,
but more than that,

188
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,630
it also says you can't really know where
the baby is.

189
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,370
And so what that means is that once you 
get your wire short enough,

190
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,204
some of the electrons might not be in 
the wires where they're supposed to be 

191
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:40,080
at the actually cause short circuits.
So that's another issue.

192
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,943
There's other levels of reality that are
micro levels that you can't detect it 

193
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,274
all.
So there's macro levels that are way 

194
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,670
beyond you,
you know,

195
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,480
political systems,
economic systems,

196
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,750
biological systems,
physical systems outside of that.

197
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,584
And then there are these microsystems 
layered all the way down and things can 

198
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,240
go wrong at any one of those levels.

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,260
And,
and a lot of Max invisible to us.

200
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,153
You know,
the same thing happens when something 

201
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,490
goes wrong with you.
You know,

202
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,200
it's like what's wrong with you?
Maybe you're,

203
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,500
you're malfunctioning at the molecular 
level,

204
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,783
your DNA isn't working properly.
So you get cancer or maybe some virus 

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,240
which is even smaller than the DNA comes
in and takes up residence in that that's

206
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,730
really not so good.
Or you know,

207
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,613
maybe maybe you're eating something 
wrong and you have an organ malfunction 

208
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,963
or,
or maybe your family is screwed up and 

209
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,404
you're stressed half to death.
And the reason they're screwed up is 

210
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,863
because of your liver,
let's say a radically a society that's 

211
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,100
not friendly to your particular 
immigrant type.

212
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,630
And so the real reason that you're sick 
is because of,

213
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,270
you know,
people's inability to get along with one

214
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,310
another and so on and so forth and so 
on.

215
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:48,090
And so God only knows where you're 
supposed to focus,

216
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,330
but focus,
we do.

217
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,720
And one of the things that,
um,

218
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,590
motivation allows you to do is to figure
what you're going to focus on.

219
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Now you think,
God,

220
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,010
there's all these things to focus on.

221
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,640
There's an infinite number of things to 
focus on.

222
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,020
How in the world do you ever figured out
how to focus on anything?

223
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,700
Well,
the answer to that is evolution.

224
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:20,010
Fundamentally,
it's like

225
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,320
you can view evolution in the following 
way.

226
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,154
You know,
there's,

227
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,030
you can kind of think about the 
background of reality.

228
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:33,300
I think the best way to think about if 
it has this interplay of patterns,

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,553
complex patterns,
sort of like music and those patterns 

230
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,360
are always changing and that sort of 
dynamic weight.

231
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,090
And they exist at multiple levels just 
like complex music does.

232
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,670
So then imagine that you're trying to do
is to

233
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,053
to dance to the music,
to align yourself to the music and it 

234
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:53,100
keeps changing on you.
And so well,

235
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,120
what do you do?
Well,

236
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,520
if you can change that,
you can change for the music,

237
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,130
but if you can change then that's it.
You're not dancing anymore.

238
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,080
Okay.
So let's assume that there's two ways of

239
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:08,010
solving that problem.
One way is just sheer number.

240
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,383
You're a single celled organism or a 
mosquito and you don't have that much 

241
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,340
neural capacity for transformation.

242
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,530
And so you don't know what the melody is
going to be when you,

243
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,390
when you lay your eggs,
if you're a mosquito.

244
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:19,224
And so you produce like a million eggs 
and some of them can dance to the 

245
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,980
current beat and the others camp and so 
they all die.

246
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,610
And so that's what happens over the 
course of evolution for a very,

247
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,444
very long time.
The melody keeps changing and then what 

248
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:37,830
creatures do is propagate a whole 
variety of variance of themselves.

249
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,703
And in the case of like small animals or
fish even or crayfish or that sort of 

250
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:43,740
thing,
you know,

251
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:44,574
they just overproduce offspring like mad
and hope that one of them can dance to 

252
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,190
the current tune and then,
you know,

253
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:52,440
we get three and a half billion years 
later,

254
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,420
roughly speaking here,
we all are.

255
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,520
And what we've got is this dynamic 
nervous system and it enables us to take

256
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,713
an external pattern and map it to a 
neurological pattern or multiple 

257
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,830
neurological patterns because we can 
interpret things right?

258
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,610
And then to output that to multiple 
behavioral patterns.

259
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:12,444
And so in some sense what we've done is 
we've internalized the process of 

260
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:20,760
evolutionary variation into ourselves 
and the Camorra complex.

261
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,623
Roughly speaking,
the more layers your nervous system has 

262
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,683
imagined,
there's a pattern on your skin and then 

263
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,350
that's interpreted by a pattern of 
nerves.

264
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,700
And then those nerves have an output 
there.

265
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,543
Sensory nerves will say,
then those have an output to motor 

266
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,394
nerves.
And then how those have an output to 

267
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,620
muscles.
That's you roughly.

268
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,803
You know,
you're maybe a four layer thing in that 

269
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:44,040
regard,
but then you grow all these extra layers

270
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,530
of neural tissue,
you know,

271
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,480
so that the layers are hundreds of 
cells,

272
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,400
thick,
one hundreds of layers thick,

273
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,234
and then you can map a whole bunch of 
patterns in the external world onto a 

274
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,144
whole bunch of patterns in the neuro 
world and then onto a whole bunch of 

275
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,450
patterns in the motor world and so that 
makes you dynamically adaptable.

276
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,850
But you learned all that through this 
incredibly painful process of evolution,

277
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:12,160
which basically consisted of the death 
of like 99 point nine,

278
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,003
nine,
nine percent of everything that ever 

279
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,820
lived.
Species and individuals alike.

280
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,960
So now why is that relevant?
Well,

281
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,810
how do you figure out how to focus in on
something?

282
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,060
Well,
a big part of that is actually,

283
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,550
let's see how we do it.
Well,

284
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,890
first of all,
what are you focusing on in here?

285
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,900
Well,
not poisonous snakes and you know,

286
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,200
rampaging lions and chimpanzees because 
they're not in here.

287
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,690
And the reason they're not in here,
roughly speaking,

288
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,870
is because while you live in a culture 
that's very,

289
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,690
very highly advanced and it's got walls 
like mad,

290
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:51,110
this is a carcassone I think of a French
city of medieval city.

291
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,000
It's still exists.
Beautiful City.

292
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,370
You'll see how the medieval people solve
this problem.

293
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,061
It's like,
well,

294
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,380
you can't deal with much.

295
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,250
Okay,
well what do we do?

296
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,350
Build some walls,
keep a bunch of stuff out.

297
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,453
You don't have to worry about the 
rampaging barbarians then because they 

298
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,364
just can't get in.
And so a lot of the reason that you can 

299
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:07,334
handle the insane complexity of the 
world is because it's not even 

300
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,350
neurological,
right?

301
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,760
It has virtually nothing to do with your
physiology.

302
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,650
It's just that you're,
you know,

303
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,743
you're,
you're in a university and the 

304
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:20,834
university is protected by the city and 
the city is protected by the province 

305
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,554
and the province is protected by the 
country and the country is protected by 

306
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:30,560
its know all of its multiple 
entanglements and you're just,

307
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,510
you're inside walls,
inside walls,

308
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,430
inside walls,
inside walls and so on.

309
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:35,264
And so your role is pretty simple.
You can just sit there in relative 

310
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:41,060
warmth and comfort and not have to worry
about anything.

311
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,490
So that's one solution.
There's a cultural solution,

312
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,601
man.
You know,

313
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,434
inside the cultural solution,
obviously there's architectural 

314
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:48,164
solutions of various sorts and then 
there's political and economic 

315
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,244
institutions that are pretty stable and 
they keep you from having to deal with 

316
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,340
chaos.
I mean you could see that chaos breaking

317
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,174
out a little bit in the previous weeks,
right in the American election because 

318
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:07,070
the trump people in the left wingers are
going at it at the trump rallies and you

319
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,820
know,
you can see that's just tinder.

320
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,673
That could just blow up at any point.
And then all of that protection that's 

321
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,420
there because of these very complex 
games that we've agreed to play,

322
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,960
like the democracy game,
you know,

323
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,120
that just all flies by the wayside and 
all of a sudden you have to content with

324
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,790
what people are like and that is not 
something you want to do.

325
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,153
Those people,
they they're capable of anything which 

326
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:32,690
is good but also really bad.

327
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,380
Well then the next thing is you've got a
body now.

328
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,290
That's where the evolutionary process 
really kicks in and so your.

329
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,393
The reason your body is the way it is 
roughly speaking is because it's 

330
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,990
mimicked the external environment,
so just like you know,

331
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,933
piaget talks about children using their 
bodies to mimic the external 

332
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,810
environment.
You know,

333
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,013
voluntarily your body is set up through 
this evolutionary process so that you 

334
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,070
could focus on precisely that subset of 
things.

335
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,904
That seems to keep something like you 
going for long enough for you to make 

336
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,684
another one,
something that's more or less like you 

337
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,450
and you know that it only really works 
for about 100 years.

338
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,583
That's pretty much where it pops out and
so you don't solve the problem very 

339
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:17,994
well.
You don't solve the problem of radical 

340
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:23,610
complexity very well,
but you solve it well enough so that you

341
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,140
live long enough to reproduce.

342
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,033
Speaking strictly biological and that 
appears to be good enough and part of 

343
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,020
the reason why you seem to expire 
because you might think,

344
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,530
well if I evolution,
it's like why don't people just live for

345
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,720
like 500 years instead of 100 years?
You know,

346
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,554
because you think that
someone who could continue to reproduce 

347
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,253
for 200 years instead of 100 years would
have it all over someone who could only 

348
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:50,574
manage it for 50 years say,
but it turns out that your genes have a 

349
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:56,030
better time of it if you just put them 
into a new body

350
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,583
and shuffle off this mortal coil so 
you're not using up too many resources 

351
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,450
while your children and grandchildren 
are trying to,

352
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,160
you know,
survive.

353
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,910
And so that's an evolution.
You've got to,

354
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,230
that's an evolutionary solution.
It's not.

355
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,093
Death is not technically inevitable.
There are creatures that are roughly 

356
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,490
immortal gold fish for example,
which is really annoying.

357
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,323
So like really goldfish because their 
cart and cart basically just keep 

358
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,860
growing and it isn't obvious that they 
sent us or,

359
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,703
or age they get killed because they get,
they get diseases and this sort of 

360
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,700
thing.
But you know,

361
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,543
there are 300,
400 year old carp and some turtles seem 

362
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,520
to not a age really.
And you know,

363
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,360
and then of course your DNA is being 
there for ever since life started.

364
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,003
So it doesn't really age either.
And it corrects itself so things can 

365
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,830
last a very,
very long time,

366
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,210
but,
but not us.

367
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,313
So anyways,
were put inside of this floor and he 

368
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,790
frames things for us and starts 
narrowing things down.

369
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,010
In this,
you know,

370
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,844
our psychophysiological cells have a 
limited range of interests and desires 

371
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,530
and needs,
however you want to construe that,

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,633
you know,
and then that gets instantiated more 

373
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,400
into the nervous system.

374
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,743
And you know,
it's a mistake to think people always 

375
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:14,874
think your brain is in your head.
And that's really not a very bright way 

376
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,604
of thinking about it.
I don't know exactly why we think that 

377
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:22,170
way because while there's the nervous 
system,

378
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,153
you can see it right there.
There's a lot of your nervous system 

379
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,800
that's not in your head.
The,

380
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,090
you know,
the volume,

381
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,190
the motor and sensory systems are 
distributed throughout your body.

382
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,443
Your spine is smart enough so that if it
gets severed and we put you over top of 

383
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,010
a treadmill,
suspend you,

384
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,844
you can walk,
you don't know you're walking and you 

385
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,060
can't control it,
but your legs,

386
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:45,690
we'll do a perfectly good job of walking
without you being involved at all.

387
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,800
So your spine is brain tissue for all 
intents and purposes.

388
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,180
You're brain is distributed through your
body.

389
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,700
And so,
and then you know,

390
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:59,701
it's evolved so that it's pretty good at
going around specifying what it needs.

391
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,840
And so,
you know,

392
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,180
we talked about the hypothalamus the 
other day.

393
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,690
That was it and how it,
you know,

394
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,573
accounts for what I called 
subpersonalities that are motivated 

395
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,810
towards particular ends.
And those ends are,

396
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,663
you know,
obviously the things that we would 

397
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,420
identify as fundamental biological 
necessities,

398
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,003
but then they transformed themselves as 
we interact socially into more and more 

399
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,630
complex fundamental biological 
necessities.

400
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,450
You know,
you.

401
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,283
Because it's,
it's a tricky thing because people talk 

402
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,780
about needs as if they're biologically 
instantiated.

403
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,933
You know,
like they're the fundamental building 

404
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,120
elements of motivation.
But it's not really that obvious a.

405
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,560
because you know,
you might say,

406
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,280
well,
being hungry as a biological need,

407
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:52,910
but being a doctor isn't,
well not really because you know,

408
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,763
if you do end up being a physician,
you pretty much solve the food 

409
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,720
acquisition problem permanently,
right?

410
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:02,710
So it's just a higher order 
manifestation of the same thing and it's

411
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,544
higher order because instead of just 
eating once you eat everyday for the 

412
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:09,160
next 40 years and instead of just 
feeding you,

413
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,800
you feed you and your family and maybe 
some other people too.

414
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,800
So thinking of that as something that 
isn't rooted in biology is not accurate.

415
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,843
It's,
it's a kind of a continuous 

416
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:24,031
complexification from the,
from the simple local time bound,

417
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,373
a
immature subpersonalities that can only 

418
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:30,994
fulfill themselves in this moment and 
with help to the development of those 

419
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:35,824
circuits,
which I would say is your personality 

420
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:41,830
that are capable of providing you with 
what you need in order to live and to be

421
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:44,530
attractive to other people across very 
large spans of time.

422
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,960
It's like a tree,
you know,

423
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:48,490
it's like a tree expanding upward.
So good.

424
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,130
It's a good metaphor.
So.

425
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,590
All right,
so that's fine.

426
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:54,424
So that's motivation sets up your 
perceptual frame and so people often 

427
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:02,800
talk about motivation as if it's a drive
or a need,

428
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,693
something,
not that those terms are particularly 

429
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,734
well defined.
A drive I suppose is a deterministic 

430
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,200
sequence of motor output,
something like that,

431
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,423
but it's not accurate because the 
motivation actually it specifies what 

432
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:21,421
you look at and specifies right what you
see it's.

433
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,600
And then it specifies as well what 
you're going to respond to emotionally.

434
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,173
So just imagine this.
Say I'd offered a $10,000 prize for the 

435
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:33,874
person who counts the number of 
basketballs correctly and then you know 

436
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,404
you're doing your best to count the 
number of basketballs in the monkey 

437
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:45,100
illusion and somebody stands up in front
of you like this and blocks your view.

438
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,410
Well,
what emotion are you going to feel?

439
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,840
Negative emotion,
right?

440
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,733
In all likelihood.
And so that might be anxiety because 

441
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,023
you're not going to win.
It might be fear or anxiety because 

442
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,104
you're not going to win,
but also fear because what the hell is 

443
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,330
this crazy person doing anger,
right?

444
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,680
That's another negative emotional 
though.

445
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:10,250
There's a positive attack element to it.
You know,

446
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,990
um,
frustration,

447
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,550
disappointment,
maybe some grief,

448
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:14,384
like a whole,
I'm differentiate mess of negative 

449
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:17,690
emotions.
Well,

450
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,160
why?
Well,

451
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:24,161
in some sense the motivational system 
specifies the map and the,

452
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,940
and the goal.

453
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,350
It's a little more complicated though 
because it also specifies where you are,

454
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,890
but it's like you can think about it as 
a map with a,

455
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,870
with a destination.
That's why stories are like that,

456
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,733
you know,
because we inhabit Lumax Max like that 

457
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,480
all the time.
And then what emotions do,

458
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,640
roughly speaking is telling you whether 
or not things are going the way you want

459
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:47,474
them to as you're on that path.
And so the emotions in some sense have 

460
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:54,140
to have a motivational specification 
before their,

461
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,650
before their,
uh,

462
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,850
before they're properly functional.
Like,

463
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,680
what should you get angry at?
Well,

464
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:01,514
generally you get angry at things that 
either interfere with your progression 

465
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:08,390
towards a valued goal or upset the 
entire.

466
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,090
Some personality,
you know,

467
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:13,520
that,
that contains the goal itself.

468
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:14,780
That's a more,
that's a more,

469
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,000
uh,
what would you call it?

470
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,730
That's a more serious failure.

471
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,230
You know,
if you have to,

472
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,930
it's one thing to fail when you're 
trying to do something.

473
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:26,990
It's another thing to fail so hard you 
have to give up the whole project.

474
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,343
We would rather just fail at sub sub 
element then have to give up the whole 

475
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:31,731
project.
Right?

476
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,564
It's one thing to fail an exam,
it's another thing to fail out of 

477
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,620
university.
So,

478
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,630
and you know,
I think the reason for that,

479
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:39,464
I thought about that for a long time.
Why is it worse to fail out of 

480
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,093
university?
Assuming you want to be in university 

481
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,200
then it is to fail an exam.
How does your brain compute that?

482
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,733
No,
because you can't tell all the 

483
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,130
consequences,
right?

484
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:52,964
So it's not self evident,
but it seems to me that it's something 

485
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:59,480
like,
you think about these,

486
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,463
these functional subpersonalities as 
having a temporal and spacial range of 

487
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,000
application.

488
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,373
So if you're a university student,
if you're sort of stabilized for like 

489
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:12,530
four years,
right?

490
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,880
Wherever you go,
you can say,

491
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,781
people say,
well,

492
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,190
what do you do?
And you can say,

493
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:18,710
I'm a university student and everybody's
happy about that.

494
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,850
You know,
from an economic perspective,

495
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,370
it's probably worse than being 
unemployed,

496
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,290
right?
In some sense and,

497
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,410
but if you can't just go tell people 
that you're unemployed and then you have

498
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,990
a nice little high status slot in 
society,

499
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,824
it doesn't work that way,
but you can do that as a university 

500
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,280
student,
you know,

501
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,153
so it fulfills your social obligations 
and it makes you feel like you're doing 

502
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:42,230
something at least vaguely useful and 
you know,

503
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,360
I mean apart from the learning and all 
the other things that are positive about

504
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,940
it.
So what happens is,

505
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:50,910
is that map basically covers a space and
time.

506
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,430
The time is four years in the space is 
everywhere.

507
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,820
You go during those four years and then 
if that map burns up,

508
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,654
it's like you're exposed on all fronts 
for that entire four year period and 

509
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,890
that might even be the two years 
previously.

510
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,480
Right.
For example,

511
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,343
because it's strange to think that,
but if you bail out of university 

512
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,303
halfway through your third year,
you've also structured the map that you 

513
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:16,974
use to organize your memories in some 
sense of the previous two and a half 

514
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:20,911
years.
Right?

515
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,744
Because first of all,
they were the memories of someone who's 

516
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,503
doing just fine and going through 
university and now all of a sudden 

517
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,900
they're the memories of someone who 
failed.

518
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,600
Those aren't the same memories.
And so it's weird that you know,

519
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,260
it's weird that an error can alter the 
past,

520
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,720
but,
but,

521
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,583
but you can and often does,
I mean break any relationship breakup 

522
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,950
that's of any significance will do 
exactly the same thing.

523
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,783
Especially if you are trading right.
It's like it's not just the present and 

524
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,624
the future that dissolve into chaos and 
take you on a little trip to the 

525
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,390
underworld.
It's also your revision.

526
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,210
You're the necessity of revising your 
past.

527
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,910
So anyways,
so then I would say,

528
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,744
well,
failing a class while the class will be 

529
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,943
structured,
you in some sense and focuses you for a 

530
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:08,110
certain subset of the general going to 
university map.

531
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:08,944
So it's going to be less traumatizing to
do poorly on a class than it is to fail 

532
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:18,861
out of university because the amount of 
space and time that goes respective maps

533
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:19,974
covers differs.
And so what you're trying to do always 

534
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,023
is to lay out under a functional game 
that's a good way of thinking about it 

535
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,350
on the spacetime territory that you 
inhabit.

536
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,423
And if you understand that,
then you can start to understand a 

537
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,550
little bit about emotions.

538
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,600
So let's,
yeah,

539
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,400
yeah,
now,

540
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,710
okay,
I have to put a little Coda in there.

541
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,310
And that's the motivations and emotions 
are not technical terms.

542
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,680
There's sort of like in an ego,
you know,

543
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:50,514
their,
their,

544
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,190
their turns that you can use to 
structure a debate.

545
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,863
Like I showed you the hypothalamus and 
you see it's made out of the Volvo's 

546
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,170
little nuclei.
They're not the same.

547
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,620
So you can't say that every part of the 
hypothalamus is doing something that you

548
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:02,454
can fit into a class.
Motivation and motivations and emotions 

549
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,230
overlap.
So,

550
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,410
you know,
I would say hunger.

551
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,410
That seems to be some of them overseeing
more purely motivation.

552
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,200
You know,
like if you have a,

553
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,800
an unsettling altercation with someone 
at tends not to make you hungry now.

554
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,210
Whereas it might make you angry,
it might make you happy,

555
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,940
it might make you sad,
you know,

556
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,130
so hunger is something that seems to pop
up,

557
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:33,690
one of these maps and then emotions 
guide your way through it or telling you

558
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:37,800
where you are on it,
but then you have complex motivation,

559
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:42,801
emotions like pain and also anger 
because pain has a goal in it,

560
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:43,700
right?

561
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,040
Get away,
but it's also,

562
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,290
or stop or get away.
It's usually get away,

563
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,290
but it also has an emotional feeling,
right?

564
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,020
It feels bad.
And so it feels like an emotion.

565
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:55,450
Pain.
Grief is like pain.

566
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,690
Disappointment is like pain.
So,

567
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,350
um,
loneliness is like paint and I mean this

568
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,184
technically all of those things can be 
addressed rather successfully with 

569
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:08,740
opiates by the way.
So technically they're the same,

570
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,880
but pain you can't really be like,
is being hurt in emotion.

571
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,040
While people will say that,
I feel hurt,

572
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,143
whatever.
And anger is another one of those that 

573
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,650
sort of ambivalent because anger has a 
goal,

574
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,530
right?
It's like

575
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,120
remove obstacle removed or destroyed 
obstacle in a sense.

576
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,180
That's the goal of anger.
But people talk about it as an emotion,

577
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,133
so we're oversimplifying,
it doesn't matter because it's useful 

578
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,920
oversimplification and that sort of what
a theory is.

579
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,450
Ready,
useful oversimplification.

580
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,480
So all right,
so

581
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,030
I kind of laid out what I think are the 
basic motivations there.

582
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,430
Hunger,
thirst,

583
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,330
pain,
anger,

584
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,303
thermal regulation.
You don't want to be too hot or too 

585
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:00,940
cold.
Panic or escape,

586
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,020
affiliation or care,
sexual desire,

587
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,153
exploration play,
and you can kind of divide those into 

588
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:12,820
self maintenance motivations and south 
propagation motivations.

589
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:13,654
Roughly speaking,
I'm sort of just a way to keep track of 

590
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:17,860
them.
And then emotions.

591
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,023
So the hypothalamus is involved in law 
that it's not the only thing but it's 

592
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:22,450
involved in a lot of that.

593
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,443
So here's sort of how I've 
conceptualized one of these maps and 

594
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:29,680
we've seen this thing before.
You're,

595
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,900
you're at point a because if you're 
using a map or if you're in a game,

596
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,630
you know there's a starting point or 
you're a player.

597
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:40,080
Either way there's you there and then 
you're going somewhere,

598
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:40,914
right?
And you have to do something to get 

599
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:42,541
there.
Okay?

600
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:45,480
So that's the little map and maybe you 
have to go make a peanut butter sandwich

601
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:46,314
or you have to turn the thermostat down 
or you need to call your friend or 

602
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:49,860
whatever,
but it's,

603
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,933
it's the same kind of structure that 
you're using in all those different 

604
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,830
situations.
And they switch,

605
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,380
you know,
now you're finished being hungry,

606
00:31:58,381 --> 00:31:59,820
now you're thirsty.
Then your lonesome,

607
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,100
you know,
it's like it says if this,

608
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,910
it's one,
it's one damn thing after another,

609
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,893
roughly speaking.
And so that's what keeps you alive and 

610
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,840
you have to be chasing things all the 
time because your natural tendency is to

611
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,400
run out of fuel and became.

612
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,530
And so that's entropy.
You have to fight that.

613
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,933
And so that's a continual battle because
you're pretty organized and it's really 

614
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:24,660
hard for something that organized to 
just stay organized.

615
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,040
You know,
it's a lot easier.

616
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,020
There's a million ways to mess up your 
route.

617
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,190
There's like one way to clean it or 
maybe 10 years,

618
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,303
but you get the point.
So then it's the same with anything 

619
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,204
that's extraordinarily complex.
There's not that many ways it can stay 

620
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,093
order.
And there's a lot of ways it can fall 

621
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:41,924
apart,
so that's why you're running all the 

622
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:45,530
time on a treadmill.
You're fighting the second.

623
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,393
Is it the second law of thermodynamics?
Is entropy the second law of 

624
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,030
thermodynamics?
I think so,

625
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,310
that's a major one.
So you know,

626
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,450
good luck in your scrap because
you're going to need it.

627
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,893
So.
So all of these little underlying 

628
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:03,284
biological systems pop up the primary 
maps and then those are elaborated 

629
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:08,114
upward into maps that are more and more 
complicated and the more and more 

630
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:10,964
complicated maps maybe solve two 
problems at the same time for a week or 

631
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,000
they solve 10 problems at the same time 
for 20 years.

632
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,240
That's why you want a job or a career,
right?

633
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:24,280
I mean the whole bunch of problems are 
solved all immediately as soon as you're

634
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,123
employed.
So I mean you have some other problems 

635
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,550
but.
But that's inescapable anyways.

636
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,473
Okay.
So you're inside one of these so you're 

637
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:34,484
always motivated.
You're always running around after 

638
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,030
something.
And you know,

639
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,873
that's another thing to know too,
because the basic state of human beings 

640
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,160
is not quite essence.
You know,

641
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,500
you're not napping in front of a 
fireplace.

642
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,220
If you're not pursuing something that 
you're motivated to pursue,

643
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,293
then generally what you're doing is 
figuring out how to pursue other things 

644
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,060
that you're motivated to pursue.
And that's exploration.

645
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,090
So if you're not actively motivated by,
by biological necessity will say for the

646
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:02,714
sake of simplicity,
then the next motivation kicks in is 

647
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,660
which well,
prepare for the next time that you're so

648
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:12,740
motivated and that really accounts for 
our capacity to explore and we're always

649
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,100
zooming around the world and trying to 
figure out what to do with it next,

650
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:16,963
you know,
acquiring more information or even when 

651
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:23,030
we're entertaining ourselves because we 
almost always looking at stories when we

652
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:23,900
entertain ourselves.

653
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,763
We're still acquiring the information 
that has functional significance and so 

654
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,174
attractive to us that we find it 
innately rewarding just to observe that 

655
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,704
sort of thing.
So it's even in strange situations like 

656
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,530
people will go to horror movies.
It's like,

657
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,380
what?
What's wrong with,

658
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:40,090
uh,
you know,

659
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,820
the why do you want to go get scared or 
disgusted because that's horror,

660
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:44,654
right?
Fear and disgust that this plane 

661
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,954
uncertainty,
horror movies like the Blair witch 

662
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,290
project,
that's pretty much all fear and then you

663
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,124
know,
the slasher movies and that sort of 

664
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,190
thing,
that's pretty much all discussed and you

665
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,024
might say,
well why bother exposing yourself to 

666
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:02,441
that and part of it is get over it.
No,

667
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,463
it's exposure because life has 
terrifying elements and it has 

668
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,390
disgusting elements and you're going to 
have to learn to,

669
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,910
to maintain yourself in the face of 
that,

670
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,744
you know,
I mean certainly illness is going to 

671
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:21,390
challenge your capacity to deal with 
disgust and you know,

672
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,300
there's any number of reasons to be 
terrified.

673
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:27,650
So you go to movies and you practice 
facing.

674
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,090
Then you observed that you can know and 
I mean there's other motivations too,

675
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,073
but those are the sort of the healthy 
ones that go along with people wanting 

676
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,670
to expose themselves to dangerous 
situations.

677
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,133
So.
So even in that you see exploration in 

678
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:45,720
the preparation for what's going to 
happen next and the exploratory circuits

679
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,320
and very,
very fundamental circuit.

680
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:49,200
It's also hypothyroid,
ironically mediated.

681
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,870
So the way the hypothalamus works,
it's quite cool,

682
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,704
is that

683
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,610
on one hand it pops up all these little 
maps that you can occupy that did have,

684
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:01,360
the court will say biological 
necessities,

685
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,194
so roughly Freud's id,
but when those things all shut down 

686
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:08,150
because they're satiated,
that's a technical term by the way,

687
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:12,500
satiated.
It means satisfied and it's a form of,

688
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,690
it's a form of reward,
you know,

689
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,823
so it sort of how you feel after you've 
eaten a good meal and you're in a warm 

690
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:22,130
room and your friends around you,
you know,

691
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,590
maybe you'd go to sleep if it's your 
family,

692
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,603
you know,
because I'm thinking about Thanksgiving 

693
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:31,220
or something like that.
It's just everything is taken care of.

694
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,820
And so we fall asleep.
That's sort of that satiation.

695
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:35,654
You can see that now and almost all the 
time because they spend a lot of time 

696
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,430
seizuring dogs,
they sleep a lot,

697
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,130
cats,
they sleep a lot because you know,

698
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,500
they've already attacked her cat food.
So that's pretty much it for the day.

699
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,220
So human beings,
you know,

700
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,160
we tend not so much to enter into states
of satiation.

701
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,870
Now,
what happens when,

702
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,783
when you're,
when you're in one of those little 

703
00:36:58,701 --> 00:36:59,560
units,
you know,

704
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,463
one of those little motivated things,
there's a couple of things that can 

705
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,554
happen.

706
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,853
Got It.
Here.

707
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,280
The next one probably.

708
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

709
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,813
This is good.

710
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,370
Hmm.

711
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,080
Okay.
So we talked about motivation.

712
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:42,081
So as sort of setting up this,
just a little frame and then we can talk

713
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:43,444
about emotions.
So there you're going somewhere and 

714
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,700
there was this little straight line 
that'll take you there.

715
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,740
It's nice,
efficient way to get there.

716
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,720
Now why do you want to do it 
efficiently?

717
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,363
Well,
because you use up the least amount of 

718
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:01,734
resources so then you can maintain some 
resources for doing the next thing that 

719
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:06,654
you need to do.
So you care about efficiency and 

720
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:10,920
simplicity.
So you want to go like the crow flies to

721
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,930
the destination.
And so then what,

722
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,900
what happens along the way?
Well,

723
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,123
let's say you just get to go straight 
while basically what happens is that 

724
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,663
you're motivated by your perception of 
the goal or intermediary goals because 

725
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:25,954
the goals can be linked together and 
then as long as things are going 

726
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,520
according to plan,
you know as you move towards the goal in

727
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,354
an untrammeled way,
you're going feel mild positive emotion 

728
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:37,894
and the reason for that is is that 
you're turning the environment the 

729
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,980
environment almost never has.
Most of it's irrelevant.

730
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,400
The rest of it has a positive or 
negative valence,

731
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,230
and if things are going according to 
plan,

732
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:52,510
it has a mild positive valence,
right?

733
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,003
You think things are okay and really 
what you're doing is you're observing 

734
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:57,664
two things.
You're observing that the things that 

735
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,634
should be happening,
if you know what you're doing while 

736
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:03,694
you're acting are happening,
and so each step forward is an 

737
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:12,040
indication that
you're getting closer to your goal.

738
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,520
That's incentive reward.
That's incentive reward,

739
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,140
and that's the sort of reward that you 
actually think of as fun and incentive.

740
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:20,974
Reward is produced by activation of the 
exploratory system that's in the 

741
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,010
hypothalamus.
It has its roots in the hypothalamus and

742
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:27,844
that's the dopaminergic system and 
that's the system that cocaine and 

743
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:31,474
amphetamines and all those other drugs 
that people really like to take 

744
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,593
hyperactivates,
making them feel like they're doing 

745
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:36,994
something important and useful even 
though they're not so the dopaminergic 

746
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,730
drugs in some sense,
hijack your incentive reward systems and

747
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,550
it's incentive reward because you're 
incentivized to continue moving forward.

748
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,953
Anything that you look at that makes you
want to touch it or move forward to it 

749
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,610
basically activates the dopaminergic 
system.

750
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,140
So now,
so you say,

751
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:02,974
well,
what happens when you're on your way to 

752
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:06,160
somewhere?
Well,

753
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,360
roughly what happens is neutral things,
which is okay.

754
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,150
You can ignore them,
positive things or negative things,

755
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,013
positive things happen when things are 
going according to plan or even better 

756
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,210
than according to plan.
You know you're walking to school,

757
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,650
it's raining.
Somebody you know stops and offers you a

758
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:22,484
lift.
It's like,

759
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,643
oh,
you're doing okay getting to school and 

760
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,760
that was fine,
but all of a sudden you're getting there

761
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,360
a little faster and you're not getting 
wet,

762
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,194
so at cheers you up.
It's an indication that you're able to 

763
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:34,960
save the resource as well.
You're moving towards a goal,

764
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,073
open the we mediated and then we could 
imagine a different scenario where 

765
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,330
you're walking to school in the rain and
somebody drives by you.

766
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,450
Maybe it's even the same friend and they
don't see you and there's a puddle right

767
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,510
beside you and not only do they not 
start,

768
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,393
but they completely cover you with oily 
and frigid water and so you know that's 

769
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:53,644
not so good.

770
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,300
You're angry about that and upset why?
Well,

771
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,450
your day is,
you might say,

772
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,180
my day is ruined.
What does that mean exactly?

773
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,823
Well,
it means that you had a little map on 

774
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:11,320
top of your day and you were hoping that
the day and the map would correspond and

775
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:12,154
then all of a sudden the map burned up 
and god only knows what's going to 

776
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:14,854
happen to the day and so it's like the 
bottom has dropped out your map and so 

777
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,194
and then you have to worry about your 
clothes and catching cold and all those 

778
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,104
things and turning around and going home
and what it will mean if you miss class 

779
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,284
and so on and so forth.
So basically that's the domain of chaos 

780
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,900
that we talked about.
So that's a negative thing,

781
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,883
but it's also the thing about negative 
things is there sort of hard to 

782
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,960
disentangle from unexpected things,
you know,

783
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:39,794
because most of the things that happened
to you that are negative are also 

784
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:46,691
unexpected because you don't go around 
trying to make negative things happen so

785
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,063
well.

786
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,443
What happens when something negative 
happens while you get a negative 

787
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,850
emotion?
Pain,

788
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,103
anxiety discussed.
Those seem to be the big three and 

789
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:02,594
they're mediated by different systems.
We don't understand the disgust system 

790
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,810
very well.
It doesn't load with neuroticism,

791
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:09,644
which is quite weird because all the 
other negative emotions is load on 

792
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,620
trait.
Neuroticism,

793
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,590
pain,
pain seems to be what you experienced.

794
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:18,440
If you're receptive,
surfaces are,

795
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,890
you know,
if your physiological self is subject to

796
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,623
stimulation of an intensity that's 
sufficient either to developing to 

797
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:30,740
damage it or to damage the receptors so 
you know,

798
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,663
but pain is complicated.
It's not just physical pain from 

799
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:35,174
physical damage.
It depends on how you define physical 

800
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:41,650
damage.
If someone dies that pain,

801
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,880
if you're alone and isolated,
that's paid.

802
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,400
If you're depressed,
that's paint.

803
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,570
If you're frustrated or disappointed,
that's pain.

804
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,680
Frustrated might mean something gets in 
the way of you moving towards a goal and

805
00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:59,950
disappointment might be in the whole 
damn structure just collapsed on you.

806
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,920
Either way,
that's pain now,

807
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:03,920
that's,
you know,

808
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:06,970
the behaviors would have called that an 
unconditioned,

809
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,523
like a painful stimulus.
They would've called that an 

810
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:10,744
unconditioned stimulus.
You don't have to learn for that to be 

811
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:17,260
bad.
It's sort of built in bad and they would

812
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,740
think about anxiety in response to the 
unexpected as learned.

813
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,633
So the tech like the behaviors would 
think that you need to learn what 

814
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:28,264
predicts something painful and if you 
learn that something predicts something 

815
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:32,794
painful,
then you get anxious to it or afraid of 

816
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,190
it.
So,

817
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,223
but it turns out that it's more 
complicated than that so that we know 

818
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:43,770
what the behaviors would think is that 
pain in some senses,

819
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,160
the fundamental negative emotion.

820
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,850
And then you know,
maybe you're a kid and you,

821
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,833
you,
you stand up underneath the table and 

822
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,190
you whack your head on it when you're 
learning to walk.

823
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:55,024
And then when you go under the table,
now you get anxious because you've 

824
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,070
learned that if you stand up under the 
table,

825
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,750
you bang your head in.
That hurts.

826
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:04,600
And so anxiety under those circumstances
that learned behavior,

827
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,820
it's a conditioned response.
Got It,

828
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,983
okay.
But it's,

829
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,873
it's more complicated than that because 
anxiety can also be an unlearned 

830
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:13,444
response.
So if you just encounter something 

831
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:18,430
you've never seen before,
it's going to make you anxious.

832
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,760
And there's actually a circuit that 
mediates anxiety.

833
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,110
So it's not just a secondary derivation 
of the pain circuitry,

834
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:26,944
it's its own little unit,
and it's sort of like you figured out 

835
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:31,860
over time,
over evolutionary time,

836
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,670
not to get hurt because you know you 
don't want to be damaged,

837
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,504
but then you've,
you've learned how to detect the 

838
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,194
probability that you will get hurt for 
so long that you've also evolved a 

839
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,570
system just to respond to that.

840
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,950
And so some of that response to things 
that you have learned are dangerous.

841
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,700
Some of it responds to things that are 
generally dangerous,

842
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,470
blonde spiders,
uh,

843
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,990
in insects of various sorts,
facial expressions that indicate fear or

844
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:07,290
disgust or anger.
I'm broken.

845
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,280
Limbs bodies especially mutilated.
Once you know,

846
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,350
you can think,
you know what's in horror movies,

847
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,420
that's all sort of primary fear stimuli,
right?

848
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,503
And it's built right into now.
Psychologists debate about whether it's 

849
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:23,760
bird built in or whether you can just 
learn it really easily.

850
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,680
But I would say there's sort of a 
continuum.

851
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,770
Some of it seems pretty damn built in 
snake fear.

852
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,680
For example,
chimps who've never seen snakes,

853
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,660
you bring one into their cage.
It's a rubber snake.

854
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:34,494
Poof,
they hit the roof and then they look at 

855
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:36,954
it and snakes in the wild,
a chimp will go up to his big snake in 

856
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:42,300
the wild and who data,
if they have this special snake,

857
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:43,134
they called a snake wrapped to look at 
the thing and some of them will just 

858
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:48,810
look at the snake for like 24 hours so 
you know,

859
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:53,040
partly they're afraid of it partner,
they want to explore it and so what they

860
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:53,874
do,
they get close to it and the fear 

861
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:55,974
increases and then they back up and the 
fear decreases and the curiosity 

862
00:45:59,251 --> 00:45:59,880
increases.

863
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,713
So what happens is they move back and 
forth until they're right on the line 

864
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:04,284
where they're afraid but they're curious
and so then they're stuck and they're 

865
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,304
looking at it and you,
you experienced that all the time 

866
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:15,030
actually because when you are engaged in
something that's meaningful,

867
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,080
that's where you are and that's like the
line between order and chaos.

868
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,213
You know,
because you want to solve and it's 

869
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:22,110
important leader.
You are,

870
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:22,944
I don't know,
maybe you're reading papers about some 

871
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,610
illness that you hope to work on her 
study.

872
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:27,121
It's like,
well,

873
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,840
you're worried about the damn illness,
you know all you're doing is confronting

874
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:34,110
it through the paper so you know you're 
fairly well sheltered from it,

875
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:37,530
but you don't want it to exist and you'd
rather it wasn't around,

876
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,750
but you're curious so you're going to 
get engrossed in it,

877
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:40,584
and most of you,
to the degree that you're immersed in 

878
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:47,010
anything are part immersed because you 
perceive it as a problem,

879
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,640
so you know that's like existential 
anxiety in a sense.

880
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,140
It's like it's just part of being.
There's problems that have to be solved.

881
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,690
They produce anxiety,
they're complicated.

882
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,213
You find this,
you find a way of approaching them so 

883
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:04,800
that the anxiety doesn't overwhelm you,
and so the curiosity is optimized.

884
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,663
That's an incentive reward activation 
and then you're awake because the 

885
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,820
anxiety keeps you awake and so does the 
curiosity and you think,

886
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:12,654
yeah,
this is a good place to be and it is a 

887
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:14,784
good place to be because you're.
You're optimally protected right there 

888
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:19,350
and you're optimally learning.
So yes,

889
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,543
that's a good place to be.
You could think about that as an answer 

890
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:27,390
to the Nietzschean problem of how you 
create value.

891
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,850
You don't exactly created,
you find it.

892
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,253
There's problems that need to be solved.
They automatically engage your emotions 

893
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:38,980
both positively and negatively.
You've got to find the right balance.

894
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,130
And it's something like contending,
you know,

895
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,263
it seems to me that human beings have to
have something to contend with or they 

896
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,130
can't tolerate themselves,
you know,

897
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:48,964
because life seems like a stupid joke if
you don't have something worthwhile to 

898
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:52,504
do,
but you could have something worthwhile 

899
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:54,110
to do.

900
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:54,943
And so then maybe it's not so stupid and
observed and tragic and that's at least 

901
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:05,041
a good way to think about it.
So you've got satiation on the one hand,

902
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,033
on the positive side and the behaviors 
would have considered that an 

903
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:09,364
unconditioned response to.
They really thought about that and his 

904
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:13,120
reward initially,
you know,

905
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,350
so you take a rat,
he's hungry,

906
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,290
you feed them something,
reward now skinner,

907
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,030
he used to train rats,
right?

908
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,360
And he was the,
he was,

909
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,580
he was a very,
uh,

910
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,503
what would you call it?
Very well renowned behavioral 

911
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:27,454
psychologist.
And he could train routes to do damn 

912
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,524
near anything and what he would do is 
starve them to three quarters of their 

913
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,520
body weight because then their damn 
mode,

914
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,840
they are basically,
you know,

915
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,713
Hungry Rats,
they were hungry lonesome rats because 

916
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,630
they lived at ice isolated existence 
which rats don't like.

917
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,390
And then they would start going to three
quarters of their body weight.

918
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,224
So when,
when the behaviorist used rats as a 

919
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,210
model for people,
they actually used poetry,

920
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:56,080
lonesome rats as a model for rats as a 
model for people.

921
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,431
And you might think,
well,

922
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,370
what kind of model is that?
But it turns out it's pretty good bottle

923
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,780
because you're a lot more like a scared 
hungry rat than you'd like to,

924
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,820
that you'd like to admit.
Which is partly why you can emphasize,

925
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,020
empathize with what?
Right.

926
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:09,760
Everybody sitting there thinking,
whoa,

927
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,800
over the poor rats.
By the way,

928
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,050
the more you thought that more agreeable
you are.

929
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,900
So how many people were feeling pretty 
sorry for those rats.

930
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,750
Yeah.
So how about men?

931
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,880
How many men were feeling sorry for 
those rats?

932
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,890
Oh yeah,
about three.

933
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,193
Yeah.
There's a big gender difference in 

934
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,210
agreeableness between men and women by 
the way,

935
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,350
so
just so you know,

936
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,363
we'll talk about that more so now the 
behavior is also thought that you had 

937
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:40,660
this primary set of rewards,
call them unconditioned,

938
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,580
and then you had to learn that some 
things predicted them like,

939
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,200
oh,
classically,

940
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:52,210
maybe
rat and push a lever and get a pellet.

941
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,160
As soon as he's pushing that lever,
like Matt,

942
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,870
he's pretty happy about pushing that 
lever.

943
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,913
Okay.
And he learned that conditioned 

944
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:01,210
association between lever pushing and 
getting a reward,

945
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,690
but it turns out that because that's 
been around for so long,

946
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,643
you also have a system for it.
So it's not just a learned association 

947
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,260
to what satiates you.
It's a whole system.

948
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,183
That's the dopaminergic system and it.
The serotonin system seems to be the 

949
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,160
thing that satiates.
So you know,

950
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:21,400
if you have a big Turkey dinner,
it's like up goes the serotonin levels.

951
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,210
It's like you don't have to do anything,
and Serotonin is a calm,

952
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,223
a calming and regulating neurochemical,
which is why antidepressants stop your 

953
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:31,844
neurons from taking up serotonin before 
you've had a real chance to use it to 

954
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:39,770
regulate your nervous system.
So but Dopa mean tells you,

955
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,633
hey,
good things are on their way and that's 

956
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,520
pretty much what people run on and you 
could think about that as hope.

957
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,850
So incentive reward is sort of like hope
or promise,

958
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,773
I think promises a better term.
So there's pain and satiation and those 

959
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,074
are really ancient systems and then 
there are newer systems that are an 

960
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,753
anxiety and promise
and those are related to those more 

961
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:09,890
fundamental negative and positive 
emotions.

962
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,830
And those things regulate you while 
you're on your path.

963
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,693
Now there's one more level of 
complication because you think what can 

964
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:22,370
happen on the way to your goal?
Nothing irrelevant.

965
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,390
Okay?
So that's,

966
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,643
that's the irrelevance that enables you 
to not see the gorilla and almost 

967
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,293
everything around you is irrelevant.
And I think that's partly why people 

968
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,464
don't like to have their little maps of 
the world destroyed because if your map 

969
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:41,510
of the world is thoroughly demolished,
everything becomes irrelevant and you do

970
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:45,470
not want everything to become relevant.
It's just too much for you.

971
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:50,420
So you wake up and you're naked and it's
dark in the middle of a jungle.

972
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,090
It's like everything's relevant.
You're not going to like that.

973
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:54,943
It's going to burn me out quick.
And so most of the time you have to be 

974
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,410
protected so that almost everything's 
irrelevant.

975
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,023
And then you can focus on the few things
that you're capable of handling and you 

976
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:07,214
do that so you're in your little map and
then as you move towards your emotions 

977
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,320
play and the negative emotions appear 
when things are not going well,

978
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:16,520
when the positive emotions appear,
when things are going well,

979
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,863
that's basically how your emotions work.
Now you've got your satiation and your 

980
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,323
your pain,
then you've got your threat and your 

981
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,033
promise,
and then on top of that you've gotten 

982
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:30,763
more complicated thing,
which is novelty because that's the 

983
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:36,380
other thing that can happen when you're 
on the way from point a to point b,

984
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,720
something you didn't expect,
so what you don't understand,

985
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,853
so

986
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,453
you're walking down the street and
there's someone laying their face down 

987
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:03,230
on the sidewalk
and you know they're this,

988
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:08,330
they're disheveled and so well,
what's your emotional response while you

989
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:10,064
didn't expect it?
So you're going to be taken aback that 

990
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,163
that's anxiety.
It's like you're moving towards your 

991
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,640
goal.
The anxiety stops you.

992
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,870
Now you could think of the space.
You could think of this space,

993
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:24,470
time area around that person as 
unexplored territory.

994
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,243
Now you don't want any unexplored 
territory in your map because God only 

995
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:30,660
knows what's going to happen there.
Okay,

996
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,300
so what are you supposed to do?
Well,

997
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,620
maybe you cross the street.
You think,

998
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:35,640
well,
that person's drunk,

999
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:36,510
or maybe you think,
well,

1000
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:37,344
they're a homeless person and they're 
lying on a sleeping bag on just to 

1001
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:42,000
sleep.
You know you're going to be losing,

1002
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,923
you're going to stop,
and then you're going to observe and 

1003
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:45,954
then you're going to use little cues to 
try to put your map back together and 

1004
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:50,610
your map is what's going on here and 
what should I do about it.

1005
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,260
And so it's partly this interplay 
between anxiety and curiosity.

1006
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:57,090
Now you can just step around and 
continue,

1007
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:00,320
but maybe that'll upset your moral map.
What kind of personnel?

1008
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,163
Mind you know,
maybe I should've done something about 

1009
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:03,474
it or maybe you think there's no damn 
way I'm going to get involved in this 

1010
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:06,714
because you know,
who knows what'll happen if I step in 

1011
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:11,400
there and you know,
fair enough,

1012
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:14,460
because who knows what will happen if 
you step in there.

1013
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,910
The point is is that it's like your map 
which has made everything irrelevant.

1014
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,413
It's got a hole in it and now some of 
what's complicated is shining through 

1015
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,823
and that thing that's shining through.
So that's what the phenomenologists 

1016
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,370
talked about as shining forth.
That thing that's shining through.

1017
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,110
It's like you don't know what to do 
about it.

1018
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,750
What should you do?
Well,

1019
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:37,710
you,
you should do.

1020
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:38,544
What you do do and what you,
what you do is you prepare to do 

1021
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,490
everything and that's an emotional 
response to novelty.

1022
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,840
It's like,
well,

1023
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,740
if you don't know what to do,
you should prepare yourself for anything

1024
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,813
and that that's stress.
You could prepare it and something good 

1025
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:55,710
will happen.
You know,

1026
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,581
let's say in,
in,

1027
