Peterson to laugh.

47

Thank you.

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,810
So the way this is going to work is that
I'm going to have a conversation with Dr

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,140
Peterson for 90 minutes and then there 
is going to be a 90 minute q and a.

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,783
This event is being video recorded and 
will be published online for 

51
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,110
noncommercial non advertising purposes.
Um,

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,180
during the q and a session when you were
handed a microphone,

53
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,014
please speak directly into it.
Our viewers on youtube will appreciate 

54
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,070
it.
And finally,

55
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,963
I am a moderator between Professor 
Peterson in the audience but also a 

56
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,550
biased participant in this conversation.

57
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,223
Okay,

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,940
well,
it's a relief that's all over.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,690
Okay.
So,

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,930
um,
I thought we would start things off with

61
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:57,764
this.
I assume that many in the audience are 

62
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,404
curious but relatively unfamiliar with 
you or have heard a lot about you 

63
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,350
without ever reading or listening to 
you.

64
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,000
So I thought we might start with you 
introducing yourself to the audience and

65
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,834
maybe telling them some of the main 
things that you think they might be 

66
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,220
interested in knowing about you.

67
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,230
Well,
I guess the most relevant

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,760
detail is that I spent about
15 years writing this

69
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,370
and I worked on it about three hours a 
day every day during that period of time

70
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,720
and um,
at,

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,713
at the same time I was finishing off my 
doctorate and I started lecturing at 

72
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,214
Harvard,
but I was doing that continually and 

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,233
thinking about it continually and 
reading the material that I needed to 

74
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:03,110
read in order to write the book 
continually as well.

75
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:03,944
And
I didn't realize until more recently 

76
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:13,151
that what I was doing was at the heart 
of the postmodern conundrum.

77
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,743
I would say
I was very much obsessed by the events 

78
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,910
of the Cold War for reasons I don't 
exactly understand.

79
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:26,630
I had a lot of dreams about nuclear 
annihilation for years on end.

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,093
I mean,
it wasn't that uncommon to be obsessed 

81
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:33,080
by that when I grew up.
I mean because it was a preoccupation of

82
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,210
everyone who was my age.

83
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,910
I suppose there,
there were lots of years,

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,073
probably between 1962,
I would say probably in 1985 where 

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,840
people were pretty convinced that the 
probability of a nuclear war was high,

86
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,940
much higher now than,
than,

87
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,180
than people considered now.
Um,

88
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,820
and I was curious about this.
I was about why everyone wasn't obsessed

89
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,350
about this all the time,
first of all,

90
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,184
because it seemed like the fundamental 
issue that to armed camps were pointing 

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
something in excess of 25,000 hydrogen 
bombs each at each other.

92
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,643
I couldn't understand how anybody could 
concentrate on anything other than that 

93
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,550
since it seems so utterly insane.
Um,

94
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,790
and I was curious
what was going on exactly.

95
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,470
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,303
Was this,
one explanation was that there's a very 

97
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,190
large number of ways that human beings 
could organize themselves in society,

98
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,024
like a large number of games that we 
could hypothetically play and they're 

99
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,624
all equally arbitrary and then in an 
equally arbitrary universe and that the 

100
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,184
communists had decided to play one kind 
of game and the West and the western 

101
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,960
free market democratic types have had 
decided to play another game.

102
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:51,794
And it was all arbitrary in some sense,
and so that's what I was trying to 

103
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:56,894
figure out was what the hell was going 
on with this conflict and was it merely 

104
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,174
a battle between two hypothetically,
equally valid interpretations of the 

105
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:11,330
world drawn from a set of extraordinary 
large potential interpretations,

106
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,720
which I think would be essentially a 
postmodernist take on it.

107
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,093
And I think I went into the problem 
neutrally in that I didn't think I knew 

108
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,710
what the answer was,
you know,

109
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,610
so lots of times when you talk to people
who think or when you talk to people who

110
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,800
write,
they have an idea and it's right,

111
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,740
and then they write whatever they're 
writing to justify the idea.

112
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,740
That's how they look at it.
But it's not a good way to write.

113
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,963
A good way to write and think is to have
a problem and then try to solve it 

114
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,400
right.
To actually solve it.

115
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,590
Not to demonstrate that you're a 
priority.

116
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,410
Commitment is true.
And you know,

117
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,320
one of the signs I would say that my,
a priority commitments weren't.

118
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,183
The purpose for the writing was that I 
walked away from that 15 year project 

119
00:07:58,851 --> 00:07:59,684
with a view of the world that was 
completely different than the view that 

120
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,650
I had going in and learned all sorts of 
things,

121
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,484
especially about the role of narrative 
and religious thinking in life that I 

122
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,693
had no idea was possible when I started 
and a lot of that was a consequence of 

123
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,300
reading the great people who I read 
deeply.

124
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,180
You know,
I read all,

125
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,220
all the great works of Friedrich 
Nietzsche.

126
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,990
The great works of Dostoevsky and 
Tolstoy and most of us collected works.

127
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:37,061
Everything that had been published up to
that point and a very large swath of the

128
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:40,520
relevant clinical literature.
The Great Clinicians of the 20th century

129
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,690
and a huge stack of neuroscience and et 
Cetera,

130
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,563
et cetera.
Because I was reading constantly during 

131
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:46,544
this time and
I realized some things that I think are 

132
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,690
true.
The communists were wrong.

133
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,943
They weren't,
and not just a little bit wrong and not 

134
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,074
wrong in some arbitrary way.
They were playing a game that human 

135
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,010
beings cannot play without descending 
into a murderous catastrophe,

136
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,420
and there's something about what we've 
done in the west that's correct.

137
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,280
And I,
it's hard.

138
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:15,630
It's complicated because our,
our cognitive structures,

139
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:18,840
that's one way of thinking about it or 
are socio political arrangements.

140
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,140
They're actually,
they actually parallel one another in an

141
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,880
important way,
aren't,

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,010
are grounded in a,
in a strange set of axioms.

143
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,840
The axioms aren't rational precisely.
It's more like their narrative,

144
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,080
their narrative axioms.
Uh,

145
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,350
their stories and the story of the West 
is that the individual is sovereign over

146
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,890
the group and that that's the solution 
to tribalism.

147
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,593
And I think that's the correct solution.
Now what that means metaphysically 

148
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,010
because it's also embedded in our 
religious doctrines,

149
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,440
right?
Because especially in Christianity,

150
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,690
although not exclusively to 
Christianity,

151
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,823
the individual is sovereign,
the suffering individual is sovereign 

152
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,610
and there's something about that that's 
true at least psychologically.

153
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,683
And I don't know what that might mean 
metaphysically because who the hell 

154
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,730
knows what anything means 
metaphysically,

155
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:12,331
right?
I mean,

156
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,830
your,
your knowledge runs out,

157
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,060
right?
At some point.

158
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,583
Anyways,
I worked all these ideas out and then I 

159
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:19,974
taught for a long time courses that were
based on the ideas and the courses were 

160
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,024
very impactful.
I would say they had the same impact on 

161
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,474
the people that I was teaching as 
walking through the material had on me 

162
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,430
and while it was out of that that all of
this political

163
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,100
controversy arose.

164
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,933
I mean I was never focused on political 
controversy even though I'm interested 

165
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:49,110
in politics and I thought at many points
in my life about a political career,

166
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,610
I always put it aside for a 
psychological and philosophical career I

167
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,260
would say and
but,

168
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,133
but things started to shift badly in 
Canada over the last five years and our 

169
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,994
government dared to implement 
legislation that compelled speech and 

170
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:08,994
one of the things that I had learned 
when I was doing all this background 

171
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:14,340
investigation was that there isn't a 
higher value.

172
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,700
Then free speech isn't free speech.
It's not the right way of thinking about

173
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,534
it because it's free thought and even 
that's not the right way of thinking 

174
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,340
about it because thought is the 
precursor to action in life.

175
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,413
So there's no difference between free 
speech and free life and I was just not 

176
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,274
willing to put up with restrictions on 
my free life and so I made some videos 

177
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,043
pointing out the pathology of this 
doctrine and the fact that the 

178
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,940
government had radically overreached 
it's,

179
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,870
it's appropriate limits and well then 
you know,

180
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,120
well,
and maybe you don't know,

181
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:54,580
but I've been involved in continual 
scandal

182
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,443
since for 18 months as a consequence,
which to me as a clinician indicates 

183
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,250
that I got my damn diagnosis.
Right,

184
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,830
right.
It's not about pronouns.

185
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,190
It's about something a lot deeper than 
that.

186
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,790
And I stand by that.
I believe that it's the case and I don't

187
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,730
think that we would all be here tonight 
if that wasn't the situation.

188
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,143
So.

189
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,900
So I wanted my first or my next question
to be about Lafayette.

190
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,453
And so I thought I would read a couple 
of facebook posts that certain students 

191
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:32,394
who are critical of you read in the lead
up to this event and just ask you to 

192
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,264
respond to them.

193
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,780
So this is a student writing Lafayette 
College.

194
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:41,614
I'm utterly disappointed that you're 
allowing this to take place on our 

195
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:44,674
campus.
I thought we went through this last 

196
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:46,924
semester with roaming millennial,
inviting hateful speakers who make 

197
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,064
wildly unsubstantiated.
Claims is not going to fly with the 

198
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,300
student body.
I get it.

199
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,313
The middle series events are private and
not endorsed by the college that you 

200
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:02,110
absolutely have the power to make a 
statement on this,

201
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,200
the fact that you're not as an 
embarrassment to our community.

202
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,303
If you believe that this man is a 
legitimate source of knowledge because 

203
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,594
he has a degree in clinical psychology,
feel free to ask our psychology 

204
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:18,610
department faculty in Counseling Center 
staff about the validity of his claims.

205
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,220
I'm certain they would not endorse this 
speaker.

206
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,900
Do better in all caps.
For those of you unfamiliar,

207
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:29,110
Jordan Peterson is known for denouncing 
the me too.

208
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:29,944
Movement,
claiming that women are in no way 

209
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,554
marginalized in the west,
arguing against the existence of gender 

210
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:36,754
neutral pronouns,
arguing against gun control in the US 

211
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,013
and claiming that identity,
politics and social justice movements 

212
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,300
are part of a devious Marxist agenda.

213
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,120
And then another student responded,
and this is briefer,

214
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,583
college conservatives know that if they 
bring in a speaker who was willing to 

215
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,424
blatantly insult a portion of the 
audience and the libs get angry enough 

216
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,780
about this for good reason,
then they may get an op ed written about

217
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,180
them in the New York Times.
As a result,

218
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,810
there are a whole group of hacks like 
Milo and Peterson,

219
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,130
who get famous and invited purely for 
their promise to Miss Gender,

220
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:16,960
trans students and advocate provocative,
but ultimately toothless arguments about

221
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,794
social darwinist race theory.
What I'm saying is that you have every 

222
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:24,640
right to be pissed.
Jordan Peterson as a harmful moron,

223
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,743
but know that,
but know that you being pissed is also 

224
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:32,260
100 percent at the point of why he was 
invited.

225
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,243
He's not a conservative.
He's just a guy who's mildly racist 

226
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,814
enough to offend the college liberals 
and therefore secure winds for the 

227
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,404
cultural right

228
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,910
comparatively mild stuff.
It's the chattering buzz

229
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,233
of ideologically possessed by demons,
so there's nothing in it that's not 

230
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,000
entirely predictable.
That's.

231
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,863
That's one of the things you know,
you notice when you're talking to 

232
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:04,544
people,
if you.

233
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,533
If you want to find out whether the 
person is there or the ideology is 

234
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,254
there,
you listen to see if you're hearing 

235
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:15,410
anything that someone else have the same
ideological mindset.

236
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,420
Couldn't have told you.
You know,

237
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,254
like I've had thousands of conversations
with people because I've spent 20 years 

238
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,154
as a clinical psychologist and one of 
the things I've learned about people is 

239
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:25,454
that there are unbelievably interesting.
If you get someone to sit down and you 

240
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,500
move past the superficial,
which you can actually do quite rapidly.

241
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,573
They'll tell you all sorts of things 
that only they know that are 

242
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,474
unbelievably enlightening and about 
their own peculiar problems about the 

243
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:47,150
way they look at the world about their,
their idiosyncratic familial dynamics.

244
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,680
Like just fascinating personal stuff.
It's the stuff of great novels,

245
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,430
you know,
and just,

246
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,263
and this is ordinary people,
I don't really think there is an 

247
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,500
ordinary person exactly there the facade
of ordinariness,

248
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,530
but behind that people are very rarely 
ordinary.

249
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,663
And so their,
the conversations are almost 

250
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,690
instantaneously fascinating.
And one of the.

251
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,890
One of the guidelines that I used in my 
clinical practice constantly was like,

252
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:16,100
I had this sense,
I probably learned this mostly from Carl

253
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,933
Rogers,
was that if the conversation wasn't 

254
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:19,334
really interesting,
then we weren't doing anything that was 

255
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,530
therapeutically useful,
but the interesting,

256
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:27,410
all of the interesting elements of it 
were were very,

257
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,244
very personal and so to replace this,
and I learned this mostly from so from 

258
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,240
Alexander,
Solzhenitsyn in his detailed analysis of

259
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,310
what I would call ideological 
possession.

260
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,983
He talked to.
He talked about people he met in the 

261
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:45,881
Gulag camps who are under the sway of a 
rigid communist Orthodoxy and noted very

262
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:51,170
clearly that it was like there was a 
crank in some sense on the side of their

263
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:56,171
hand and you could just crank the crank 
and out would come the ideological dogma

264
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,823
and it's all entirely predictable and 
people who are in a situation like that 

265
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,650
don't understand that they're possessed 
by an idea.

266
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,060
Right?
It's Carl Jung said,

267
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,894
people don't have ideas.
Ideas have people and it's like so 

268
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,903
there's nothing in that that's anything 
other than exactly what you would 

269
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,250
predict,
and then there's a deeper issue too,

270
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,084
and this is one that I think has 
bedeviled me ever since I made my 

271
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,290
initial videos,
which is

272
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,223
the route it's impossible for those on 
the radical left to admit that anyone 

273
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,754
who opposes what they're doing might be 
reasonable because what that would mean 

274
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,344
would be that you could be reasonable 
and oppose the radical left and that 

275
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:39,590
would imply that what the radical left 
was doing wasn't reasonable.

276
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,723
And so instead of dealing with the fact 
that I actually happened to be quite 

277
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:48,551
reasonable,
the attempt is to assume that anyone who

278
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,600
objects must be part of the radical,
right.

279
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,000
It's like,
well actually no.

280
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,590
There's lots of space between the 
radical left and the radical right.

281
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,650
There's the moderate reasonable left for
example,

282
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,633
and you.
And then there's the center and then 

283
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,640
there's the moderate reasonable,
right?

284
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,220
And then there's the far right,
and then there's the extreme right.

285
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,280
All of that exists in opposition to the 
radical left,

286
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,070
but it's very convenient for the 
radicals on the left to say,

287
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:16,690
oh,
well you don't buy our doctrine,

288
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:17,524
and and,
and then to immediately make the 

289
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:25,290
presupposition that you must be the most
highness example of that entire array of

290
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,390
potential objection.
It's like,

291
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,403
yeah,
well,

292
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,760
whatever,
you know,

293
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,970
it's just not a viable stance and so,
but it's convenient and it,

294
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,310
it,
it,

295
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,160
it's a bad thing because it drives 
polarization.

296
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,530
Now it's a bad thing,
but it also,

297
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,573
it doesn't address the issue.
So one of the things that I've been 

298
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:51,570
thinking about deeply over the last 
couple of weeks and plan to write about,

299
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:53,190
here's a mystery for all of you.

300
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,560
I don't care what your political 
background isn't.

301
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,830
It isn't like I'm anti left.
I've made videos documenting this.

302
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,093
I know why there's a left wing.
There's a left wing because inequality 

303
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:05,484
is a problem.
That's a way worse problem than the 

304
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:08,184
radical leftists liked to admit because 
you can't lay it at the feet of 

305
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:11,724
capitalism and the free market 
inequality is a way worse problem than 

306
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,830
that,
but it's definitely a problem.

307
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,040
And because inequality is a problem,
you need part of the political structure

308
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,874
to speak up to the for the people who 
end up a raid at the bottom of 

309
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,310
hierarchies,
it's crucial.

310
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,550
Someone has to speak for them.
That's the place of the left.

311
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,133
But then,
but then consider this kit so we can 

312
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,984
get.
We can state that the right speaks for 

313
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,354
hierarchy and the left speaks on behalf 
of those who are oppressed by 

314
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:39,600
inequality.

315
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,190
Good.
We need that dialogue.

316
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,520
The radical left.
Okay.

317
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,320
We know from 20th century history that 
things can go too far on the right.

318
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,830
No one disputes that and that things can
go too far on the left.

319
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,560
And we also know that when things go too
far,

320
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,260
it's seriously not good.
Right?

321
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,630
So when things went too far on the 
right,

322
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
then we had 120 million people die in 
the Second World War.

323
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,610
And when things went too far on the 
left,

324
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,563
we had,
God only knows how many people murdered 

325
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:12,540
as a consequence of internal repression.
At least $100,

326
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,030
million.
And we risk putting the entire planet.

327
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,680
We risk putting the planet into flames.
Okay,

328
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,490
so that's the consequence.
Alright,

329
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,423
so now in the aftermath of World War II,
let's say we've come to some sort of 

330
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:27,504
sociological agreement.
I would say that you can identify the 

331
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:30,474
radical right wingers.
When people make claims of racial 

332
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:35,640
superiority,
you put them in a box and you say,

333
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:36,474
well,
you're outside of acceptable political 

334
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:40,500
discourse,
and so you saw that with William William

335
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,410
f Buckley in the sixties when he started
his conservative review,

336
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,363
he disassociated himself from the David 
Duke types and you saw it more recently 

337
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,070
with people,
for example,

338
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:48,904
like Ben Shapiro,
who immediately distanced himself from 

339
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,670
the Charlottesville types.

340
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,350
Okay,
so now we,

341
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,303
we kind of have a sense of where you've 
crossed the damn line in your ethno 

342
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,350
nationalism,
right?

343
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,200
As soon as you move into the racial 
superiority domain,

344
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:04,210
ethnic superiority domain,
it's flight.

345
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,790
No,
you've got to be dangerous.

346
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,560
All right,
here's a question.

347
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,800
Where the hell do you across the line on
the left?

348
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,770
Exactly.
Well,

349
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,690
the answer is,
who knows?

350
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
Well,
that's not a very good answer.

351
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,354
I wouldn't say it's incumbent.
It's incumbent on people in the center 

352
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,140
and in the moderate left to say,
look,

353
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,443
things can go too far on the left and 
here's how we know that's happened and 

354
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:36,040
that hasn't happened at all.
Now I think there's a reason for that.

355
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,874
I think there's a technical reason as 
well as a motivational reason to 

356
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,774
technical reasons.
It's harder for people on the left to 

357
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:47,890
draw boundaries because people on the 
left aren't boundary drawing types,

358
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,070
their boundary dissolving types,
temperamentally speaking,

359
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:51,940
so that's a problem.

360
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,830
The second problem is it doesn't look to
me like there is a smoking pistol on the

361
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:57,664
left.
That's as obvious as racial superiority 

362
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,580
doctrines,
you know,

363
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:01,414
it's like they're in Canada.
There's a lot of push for this 

364
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:06,730
triumvirate of of radical ideas,
diversity,

365
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,640
inclusivity and equity.
Which diversity.

366
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,121
It's like,
well,

367
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,550
who's against that?
It's like being against poverty.

368
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,960
Inclusivity.
Well,

369
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:14,794
yes,
of course we want people included 

370
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,493
equity.
That's a more bitter pill to swallow 

371
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,080
because that's equality of outcome and 
for me that's a marker.

372
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,330
It's like if you're talking about 
equality of outcome,

373
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,920
you've gone too far and if you're 
talking about diversity,

374
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,400
inclusivity,
and equality of outcome equity,

375
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,310
then you've gone too far and you might 
disagree.

376
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,840
You might disagree.
That's fine.

377
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:38,674
Disagree.
If that isn't the marker for going too 

378
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,690
far,
then what's the marker?

379
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,670
Because obviously you can go too far and
obviously that's not good,

380
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,743
and to close on that,
I would also say to the people on the 

381
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:52,894
moderate left,
if you want your doctrines to have 

382
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,230
purchase and to continue to speak for 
the,

383
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,430
for those who stack up at the bottom of 
inevitable hierarchies,

384
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,533
then you owe it to yourself to 
dissociate yourself from the dangerous 

385
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:08,794
radicals because otherwise they 
invalidate your ideas and that doesn't 

386
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:13,420
seem to be.

387
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,180
You'd think the Democrats might've 
learned that in the last election,

388
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,840
but they haven't.
They haven't learned that so

389
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,033
well.
So that's my spiel about those comments 

390
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:28,330
I guess.
Okay,

391
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:33,100
so you've changed the lives of many 
young people and adults in this country,

392
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,960
in the anglosphere,
in the west,

393
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,240
in the world,
you have a massive following.

394
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,840
My girlfriend's parents call you uncle 
Jordan for example.

395
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,873
On the other hand,
and this is just a that tons of people 

396
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,010
on the left as

397
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,480
we've just seen because of your power 
and also your frontal attack on a lot of

398
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,960
their views,
hate you and viciously caricature you.

399
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,490
Then there are these other figures like 
Jonathan Heit and Robbie George.

400
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,090
They have a lot in common with you.
They are respected academics.

401
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,450
They are at least relatively well known 
outside academia.

402
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,710
They share your critiques of the 
humanities of student activists,

403
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,693
have trends in western culture.
They don't have nearly the following 

404
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,264
that you do,
but they also aren't as hated or 

405
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,740
viciously caricatured.
Moreover,

406
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,540
they may have changed the minds of more 
people on college campuses.

407
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,553
That is people on campuses who have some
sympathy for left activists or who may 

408
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:29,654
agree with much of what you say,
but react negatively to confrontation 

409
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,900
and harsh criticism.
Height has appealed the such individuals

410
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:40,580
by taking the Dale Carnegie Win friends 
and influence people approach.

411
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,300
So my questions are first,
do you agree with this dichotomy?

412
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,720
Second,
did you consciously choose one path over

413
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,680
the other,
and if so,

414
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:49,514
why?

415
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,970
Well,
I mean with the height,

416
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:53,804
for example,
was more power to them as far as I'm 

417
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,180
concerned.
You know,

418
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,250
he,
he has a different temperament than me.

419
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,220
He's,
he's more introverted,

420
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,600
he's less volatile,
I would say he's probably more agreeable

421
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,180
or more polite anyways.
Um,

422
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,880
and I think that what he's doing is 
extremely effective,

423
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,743
especially from the perspective of very 
carefully documenting the empirical 

424
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:19,510
facts about the,
the ideological,

425
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,053
ideological,
the increasingly left-leaning 

426
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,803
ideological tilt of campuses,
which is something that needs to be 

427
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,480
explored on empirical grounds.
So,

428
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,720
um,
so like I said,

429
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:36,590
more power to him and there's nothing 
wrong with being reasonable guess.

430
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,090
And then you asked,
well,

431
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,580
is that the right pathway for me?
It's like,

432
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,860
well,
apparently not a.

433
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,540
What happened when I made my initial 
videos was that know I had,

434
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,010
I had spoke,
I talked to people a lot.

435
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:58,844
I,
I've worked with people a lot about 

436
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:00,564
negotiation.
It's one of the things that I 

437
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,173
specialized in,
I would say in my clinical and 

438
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,900
consulting practice was teaching people 
how to negotiate.

439
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:07,734
And I can tell you some things about 
negotiating that you might find 

440
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:10,824
interesting and useful.
The first is you can't negotiate from a 

441
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,483
position of weakness.
So all of you who are going to be 

442
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,824
developing your careers in the future,
you need to understand that if you want 

443
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,900
to push your career forward,
well first of all,

444
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:24,540
that you do in fact have to push it 
forward.

445
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:29,541
Because if you're competent and silent,
you will be ignored.

446
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,393
And,
and you know that's rough because you 

447
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,331
might think,
well,

448
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:35,460
people should reward you because you're 
competent,

449
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,470
and yes,
of course they should,

450
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,290
but if you're competent and silent,
then you're just not.

451
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,020
You're not a problem.
You're just part of the.

452
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,130
That's keeping

453
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,963
everything functioning.
And so if you want to develop your 

454
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,634
career in terms of promotions,
say and salary is like you have to be 

455
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:54,840
competent and you have to be strategic 
and to be strategic,

456
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,750
when you negotiate for a new position or
for a new salary,

457
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,890
you have to be able to say,
if you don't give me what I want,

458
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,400
then something you don't like will 
happen to you.

459
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,160
And what that means.
It's not a physical threat,

460
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,990
it's,
it's that you have an option,

461
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,450
you know,
so you have your CV,

462
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,340
your resume in order,
right?

463
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,443
You're educated and competent and 
desirable to people outside of your 

464
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:21,520
immediate job.
You're willing to instantly put yourself

465
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,590
in the job market and undergo the stress
of finding a new position and undergoing

466
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:26,424
interviews and all of that,
and you have that all planned out so 

467
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:31,800
that when you go talk to the person that
you're negotiating with,

468
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,634
with regards to your salary,
you're credible and they see because 

469
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:35,880
they.

470
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,713
It's very seldom that you're talking to 
the person who's at the top of the 

471
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,440
pecking order.
Let's say.

472
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,663
What you need to do that with them is to
tell them a story that they can tell to 

473
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:49,620
their boss to make you not a problem.
And one a good story is,

474
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,454
look,
we really need this person because 

475
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,100
they're hyper competent and they have a 
better offer.

476
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,001
It's like,
well,

477
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,650
then you're going to win the 
negotiation,

478
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,040
but if you go in there with no power,
well you're gonna lose obviously.

479
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,700
So the first thing that you need to know
if you're going to negotiate is that you

480
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:10,701
have to be able to say no and what no 
means is that you're not going to do it.

481
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,770
And when I made the videos about bill 
[inaudible],

482
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,063
I thought it through and I thought,
there's no damn way I'm following this 

483
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,420
law.

484
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,360
I don't care what happens.
And I didn't say that lightly.

485
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,740
I thought it through.
I thought,

486
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:26,574
okay,
well let's assume the worst case 

487
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,874
scenario.
And the worst case scenario would be 

488
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:34,530
that a student would report me to the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission and then

489
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:35,364
they would do an investigation.
Then they would find me guilty because 

490
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:38,574
the Ontario Human Rights Commission 
finds 99 percent of the people brought 

491
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:45,570
to it guilty because that's what 
totalitarians do.

492
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,643
And then I would refuse to pay the finer
cooperate with whatever the reeducation 

493
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,430
they would put me through would be.
And then that would move to civil court.

494
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,740
And then I would be fine for contempt 
and then it would,

495
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,723
you know,
then the whole legal catastrophe would 

496
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,670
unfold.
And I thought,

497
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,504
well,
I could either do that or I could allow 

498
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:04,890
the government to regulate my speech.
It's like,

499
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,840
nope,
that's not happening.

500
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,280
So you might think about that as 
confrontational and it is confrontation.

501
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,113
Let's like there isn't a goddamn thing 
that can be done to me to make me allow 

502
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,290
the government to compel my speech.
That's not happening.

503
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,800
And the reason for that,
I believe the reason for that is because

504
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:30,600
I spent decades studying 
totalitarianism.

505
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,003
It's not good.
And the way that totalitarian states 

506
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,360
develop is that people give up their 
right to be there,

507
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,060
right,
to,

508
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,300
to exist their own thoughts.
They lie,

509
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,060
they,
that's what happens is that individuals,

510
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,510
the individuals sacrifice their own 
souls to the dictates of the state.

511
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,600
And then everything goes badly sideways.
So like,

512
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,201
and you think,
well,

513
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,740
how much evidence for that do we need,
you know,

514
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,320
you're looking at a quarter of a billion
deaths.

515
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,970
It's like,
isn't that enough?

516
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,153
Well,
the people that I read who were 

517
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:07,714
profound,
Victor Frankel's a good example for 

518
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:10,354
beginners,
if you want to read about this sort of 

519
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:12,274
thing,
wrote a book called man's search for 

520
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:14,254
meaning.

521
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,603
And Frankel and also Solzhenitsyn and a 
variety of other commentators as well 

522
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,030
who really looked into what happened in,
in,

523
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,810
in both the Nazi Germany and in the,
in the communist states.

524
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,940
Their conclusion was universal,
is that the lies of the state,

525
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:35,740
the lies and tyranny of the state are 
aided and abetted by the moral sacrifice

526
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:39,340
of the individual.
It's not talked down.

527
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,710
The Nazis are telling you what to do and
you're all innocent.

528
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:46,180
Tendo Bank.
That's not how it works is you,

529
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,283
you falsify your,
your being bit by bit and you end up 

530
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,650
where you don't want to be.
And that's a bad idea.

531
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,903
And if you're interested in that,
there's a great book by called ordinary 

532
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:04,480
men and you read that and you won't be 
the same person afterwards.

533
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:05,314
So I would be aware of reading it,
but it's a story about these policemen 

534
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:09,190
in Germany.

535
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,900
So they were middle aged guys,
you know,

536
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:11,890
and they'd,
they'd been,

537
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,300
they grew up and were socialized before 
the Nazis came to power.

538
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,670
So they are just your typical 
middleclass policemen.

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,200
And they were brought into Poland after 
the Nazis had marched through.

540
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,020
And um,
and charged with keeping order in the,

541
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:31,120
in the occupied state,
and they knew their,

542
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,983
their,
their commander knew that it was going 

543
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:34,384
to be brutal because they were in war,
a war time and they regard the Jews for 

544
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,610
example,
as enemies.

545
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,390
And so there was going to be a fair bit 
of rounding up with all of that with all

546
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,224
of what that implied.
The commander told the policeman that 

547
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,284
they could go home if they wanted to,
that they didn't have to participate in 

548
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,614
this.
And then what ordinary men does is 

549
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,370
document document their transformation 
from ordinary policemen,

550
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,050
the sort of people that,
you know,

551
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,243
two guys who were taking naked pregnant 
women out into the middle of fields and 

552
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:07,450
shooting them in the back of the hat and
the documents one step at a time.

553
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,080
How an ordinary person turns into 
someone like that.

554
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,491
You think,
well,

555
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:15,040
we don't want that sort of thing to 
happen anymore.

556
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,770
Well then you don't want to be that sort
of person.

557
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,993
That's how it's fixed.
And if you're not going to be that sort 

558
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:21,964
of person,
then you don't take the first steps 

559
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,893
because the first steps lead you down a 
pathway that at least in principle you 

560
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:29,674
don't want to go so well.
I think part of what makes me combative 

561
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,290
say,
compared to someone like height,

562
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:40,010
is that I've spent years looking at the 
worst things there

563
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,460
are to look at and I've learned from 
that and I've learned,

564
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,470
certainly learned things that I won't 
do.

565
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,490
And one of them is I won't let the 
government regulate my speech.

566
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,653
It's a mistake.
I don't care what compassionate 

567
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,570
principles hypothetically motivate that 
move.

568
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,130
It was unprecedented in English common 
law that move.

569
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,600
And it was all buried under this leftist
compassion,

570
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,720
which is mostly,
it's mostly a lie.

571
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,973
So I have reasons I think other than 
those that motivate someone like 

572
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:21,971
Jonathan Height to be particularly 
passionate about this issue.

573
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,553
So

574
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,080
on the subject of totalitarianism,
um,

575
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,500
I wanted to do something very quickly.
So

576
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,013
I'm guessing that even though most 
people in the room have negative views 

577
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,660
of both men,
they have a more intensely negative view

578
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:47,661
of Hitler then of Stalin.
I'm guessing almost everyone in the room

579
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,823
has a far more negative visceral 
reaction to the swastika than to the 

580
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:55,414
hammer and sickle.
Some of the protesters at your event at 

581
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,980
mcmaster university stood behind a 
banner with a hammer and sickle.

582
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,580
You've said that a hammer and sickle is 
no funnier than a swastika.

583
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,590
That quote,
the reprehensive,

584
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,533
the reprehensible ideologies that are 
based in fundamental Marxism killed at 

585
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,500
least 100 million people in the 20th 
century,

586
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,334
unquote.
I've discussed this proposition with 

587
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:22,640
numerous people in recent months and 
almost no one seems to buy it.

588
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,350
No one disputes the body count under 
socialist regimes.

589
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,573
Few dispute that Stalin was a vicious 
murderer roughly on par with Hitler in 

590
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:34,634
moral terms.
Most think that communism should not be 

591
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,890
tried again.
In other words,

592
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:40,724
they share your critique of the argument
that previous communist experiments did 

593
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:49,220
not represent proper communism and that 
proper communism should be tried.

594
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,433
Nevertheless,
they still disagree with you that we 

595
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:59,330
should react as negatively to the hammer
and sickle as we do to the swastika.

596
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,523
Why?
Because they say the two ideologies are 

597
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:08,630
not morally comparable.
National Socialism is much worse morally

598
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,330
than Marxism or Marxism.
Leninism.

599
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,070
So what do you say to this?

600
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,480
Well,
I would say the first thing is that it's

601
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:21,150
highly probable that you were talking to
intellectuals.

602
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,990
Students
will call them buddy intellectual.

603
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,420
It is a mystery,
you know,

604
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,290
it's uh,
it's a,

605
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,123
it is a mystery because it is the case 
that there is something about the Nazi 

606
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,060
doctor and that seems to have a visceral
impact that,

607
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,880
that the Communists doc,
Dr doesn't have.

608
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,400
And I said when I opened my remarks 
tonight that it might be

609
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,063
the

610
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,110
issue of racial superiority.
You know,

611
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:04,560
it's,
uh,

612
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,990
it's something single that you can put 
your finger on.

613
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,340
Whereas what's happening on the left 
that's horrifying is murky.

614
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,443
It might even be multidimensional,
like maybe there isn't a single radical 

615
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,810
leftist idea that's murderous,
like the racial superiority doctrine.

616
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,823
Maybe it's a combination of three or 
maybe it's some set of four out of 10 

617
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,720
who knows.
So,

618
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,540
and because of that,
it doesn't seem as repugnant.

619
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,374
And there was also a universalizing 
tendency among the communists that 

620
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:36,951
seemed to be less morally reprehensible 
than the ethno nationalism of the Nazis.

621
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,560
So you know,
you think if you go back to 1914,

622
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,590
it's complicated.
But if you go back to say 19,

623
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:46,200
18 at the time of the Russian 
revolution,

624
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,573
it's not like the communists knew that 
their attempts to bring about the 

625
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:55,290
socialist utopia would be due to 
absolute murderous catastrophe,

626
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,010
right?
They were.

627
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:01,010
They were working in ignorance.
Now it's not that simple because by that

628
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,884
time,
Dostoevsky had already written the 

629
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:04,260
devils,
the possessed,

630
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:05,094
and he outlined very,
very clearly what he thought would 

631
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:08,604
happen if people like that got the reins
of power and Nisha had done the same 

632
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:12,984
thing in his writing.
So people knew that there was something 

633
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,260
toxic,
let's say,

634
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:17,094
and deadly about the doctrine,
but it hadn't been played out on the 

635
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,430
world stage.
But now it's like,

636
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,463
well,
this is why I said what I said at the 

637
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:28,320
beginning,
fine,

638
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,000
you know,
if,

639
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,763
okay,

640
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,020
I don't know exactly how to make the 
moral distinction,

641
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,390
but it's a distinction that has to be 
made.

642
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,140
I think that people who apologize,
who say something like,

643
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:44,420
I think,
I think that,

644
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:51,810
that it's virtually,
I don't know if it's as reprehensible to

645
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,644
say that a given ethnic group should be 
consigned to the fire and to say that 

646
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:00,480
wasn't real communism,
but they're damn close.

647
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,710
And when I hear someone say that wasn't 
real communism,

648
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,830
I know what they mean.
What they mean was if I was the dictator

649
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,463
installing shoes,
I personally would have brought in the 

650
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:16,920
utopia.
That's what that statement means.

651
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,840
And,
or it means,

652
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,703
uh,
uh,

653
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,570
an ignorance of history that's so 
utterly appalling that,

654
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,633
huh?

655
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,433
That any political statement made on 
behalf of that person whatsoever should 

656
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,580
immediately be followed by a system.
Extreme embarrassment.

657
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,800
I say one just,
um,

658
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,933
I just want to be clear that these 
students were conceding that they don't 

659
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,980
agree that they share your critique of 
it.

660
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,770
They don't share it enough.
Okay.

661
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:52,180
Fair enough.
I just wanted to make that clear.

662
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,283
But so,
so they would more or less agree with 

663
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,930
what you just said.
I think about,

664
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,143
um,
it's not okay to say those regimes 

665
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:02,020
weren't proper communism and the proper 
communism should be tried.

666
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:06,280
They still dispute though that socialism
as an ideology is on par with Nazi-ism.

667
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,980
So I just wanted to make that we can say
communism.

668
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,550
Let's say we could say radical leftist 
ideology,

669
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,593
as I said already.
There are reasons for the left and the 

670
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:16,540
right wing,
right?

671
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,170
The right wing stands for hierarchy and 
the left wing stands for the,

672
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,110
for those who are displaced by 
hierarchy,

673
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,590
right?

674
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,423
An endless problem,
but that doesn't mean that still leaves 

675
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,404
it in the camp of the people speaking on
behalf of egalitarianism to figure out 

676
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,600
just what the hell went wrong and to 
take some responsibility for it.

677
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,483
You know,
it's no joke and we see these things 

678
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,094
play out continually.
Still look at what happened to 

679
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,700
Venezuela.
Here's a fun story.

680
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,133
Do you know that it is now illegal for 
physicians to list list starvation as 

681
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,060
the cause of death for a Venezuelan 
child in a hospital?

682
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,540
That's how they're dealing with the fact
of starvation right here.

683
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:04,180
Just make an illegal to have that 
diagnosed as your cause of death.

684
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,750
That'll solve the problem.
So like,

685
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,230
you know,
we have a group of,

686
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,483
of well meaning socialists in Canada who
just produced something called the leap 

687
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,720
manifesto a couple of years ago and it's
a pretty radical,

688
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,360
uh,
it's a pretty radical document.

689
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,190
They're trying to move our socialist 
party,

690
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:26,191
the NDP New Democratic Party towards the
acceptance of this leap manifesto,

691
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,940
which doesn't look like it's going to 
happen,

692
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,043
but they were all radical promoters of,
of the Venezuelan government before 

693
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:36,220
everything went like badly sideways.
You know,

694
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:39,490
I think the average Venezuelan now has 
lost 17 pounds.

695
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,433
Now.
It's not because they were put on a 

696
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,810
voluntary dieting program.
Right?

697
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,644
It's not good.
And so if you're tilting towards the 

698
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,500
left and you're temperamentally inclined
that way,

699
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:51,334
and half the population is,
then you have an ethical problem on 

700
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,750
your,
on your hands,

701
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,763
which is how do you segregate yourself 
from the radical policies that produced 

702
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,340
the catastrophes of the 20th century.
And you can't just say,

703
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,660
well,
that's not my problem.

704
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,411
It's like,
well,

705
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:08,680
okay,
if it's not your problem now,

706
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,350
it certainly might become your problem 
in the future.

707
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,963
So when I would say it's actually 
everybody's problem in the aftermath of 

708
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,360
the 20th century.

709
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,120
It's everybody's problem.
So,

710
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,520
so it's,
it's,

711
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,190
it's,
it's complicated.

712
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,024
Like there is a genuine desire,
like I worked for a Socialist Party for 

713
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:31,270
quite a while when I was a kid,
you know,

714
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,310
and I saw both sides of it.
I saw some very,

715
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:35,144
very admirable people I was privy for 
for a variety of chance reasons to the 

716
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,194
leadership of the Socialist Party in 
Canada at the provincial and the 

717
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:47,390
national level.
I met the people who ran the provinces,

718
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:48,224
some of the provinces and who ran the 
party and a lot of them were really 

719
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,790
admirable people.
Like they'd spent their whole life,

720
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,490
I would say working on behalf of the 
working class,

721
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:58,190
you know,
so they were genuine labor leaders and,

722
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,333
and,
and,

723
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,283
and there was also a lot done in Canada 
on the left that looks like it was 

724
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:06,130
actually pretty good standard workweek.
The Info,

725
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,790
you know,
that the establishment of,

726
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,653
of pensions,
the introduction of our healthcare 

727
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,990
system,
which I would say probably overall works

728
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,840
better than the American system,
although not at the upper end,

729
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,023
um,
and they were working hard on behalf of 

730
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,350
people who had working class lives.

731
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,393
But then I also encountered the sort of 
low level activist types and I didn't 

732
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:30,914
have any respect for them at all.
I just thought they were peevish and 

733
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,673
resentful and irritable.
And those two things exist in a very 

734
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:40,790
uneasy coalition on the west.
There's care for the poor and hatred for

735
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,624
the successful.
And those two things aren't the same at 

736
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,294
all.
And it looks to me like one of the 

737
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:46,334
things that really happened when the 
communist doctrines were brought into 

738
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:49,874
play.
And also by the way we did the 

739
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,180
multinational experiment,
right?

740
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:55,520
It doesn't matter where you put these 
policies into play,

741
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:56,354
the same bloody outcome occurred.
Didn't matter whether it was Russia or 

742
00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,804
China or Cambodia or Vietnam,
or to pick a random African country or 

743
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:08,660
Cuba or Venezuela for that matter.
It was an unmitigated catastrophe.

744
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,990
And so to me that's experiment plus 
replication.

745
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,350
Not Enough,
well,

746
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,950
that has to be dealt with and it's not.
And the law,

747
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,190
the intellectual left in the West has 
been absolutely appalling in their PSA.

748
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,120
Silence on the communist catastrophe.
Like for my students,

749
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:26,954
a lot of my students really haven't 
heard about anything that happened in 

750
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:29,834
the Soviet Union in any detail until 
they take my personality class in the 

751
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:34,760
second year of university.
It's like,

752
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,750
well,
what the hell?

753
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,943
Why are they learning about that in a 
personality class in the second year of 

754
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,270
university?
That's not.

755
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,140
That should be first and foremost in,
in their,

756
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,200
in their historical knowledge.
What happened in the 20th century.

757
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,660
I mean it was almost fatal what 
happened?

758
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,000
And we still haven't completely 
recovered from it,

759
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:53,930
right?
I think,

760
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,853
isn't your President Donald trump going 
to talk to like insane totalitarian 

761
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,790
number one sometime here in the near 
future,

762
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:04,370
but that's still a Soviet era state.

763
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,370
Those people are armed to the teeth,
you know,

764
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:11,150
they have the weapon that they have 
weaponry that could easily take you out.

765
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,790
And so we're not.
I don't know if you know,

766
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:14,624
do you know what happens if you blast a 
single hydrogen bomb a hundred miles 

767
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:19,460
above the United States?
Just one.

768
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,300
You lose all your electronics,
right?

769
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,850
They're all done.
Tractors,

770
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,800
cars,
trains,

771
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,600
subways,
computers,

772
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,750
phones,
all them burn out and that's it.

773
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,420
So we're not done with this yet.
And,

774
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:38,263
and the Korean state,
North Korea as an emblematic 

775
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,270
representative of the communist 
catastrophe and everyone there is,

776
00:44:44,271 --> 00:44:48,630
starves.
There's millions of people died 20 years

777
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:50,730
ago.
It's not got any better.

778
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,923
So it's not like.
It's not like we solve this problem and 

779
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,793
there's a deafening silence on the 
intellectual side of the spectrum with 

780
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:02,730
regards to what happened on the 
egalitarian left.

781
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,550
And there's no excuse for it.
So,

782
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,123
so somewhat relatedly,
I think it's fair to say that even 

783
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:14,094
though you have criticized segments of 
both the left social justice warriors 

784
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,040
and the right,
the alt right,

785
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,473
your critical commentary over the last 
year and a half has focused 

786
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,850
significantly more on the left than on 
the right.

787
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,553
A lot of people I've talked to here at 
Lafayette at Lafayette take issue with 

788
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:32,454
that.
They say that we're so far from a 

789
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,364
Marxist takeover of our culture and 
political institutions that to suggest 

790
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,404
otherwise is to engage in a classic kind
of right wing exaggeration and hysteria 

791
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,713
that we've seen before in western 
countries in the early to mid 20th 

792
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,070
century.
They also say,

793
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,210
and this is important to them,
that the nationalist authoritarian right

794
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,980
poses more of a threat to freedom of the
individual than the left does today,

795
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,220
as it has in the West since the early 
20th century.

796
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,630
They argued that the left may have sway 
in the academy and large segments of the

797
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,300
media.
That nationalist right parties,

798
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,470
figures and movements with authoritarian
tendencies have risen,

799
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,453
become potent,
and often been victorious in recent 

800
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,590
years,
and they point to trump brexit,

801
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,750
the national front pointing to trump.
Trump

802
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,390
is rather pointless.
I mean,

803
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:25,224
I don't know what trump is,
but to think of him as a figure of the 

804
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,520
radical right is a little on the absurd 
side.

805
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So I mean we are polarizing and so who,
God only knows where the ultimate danger

806
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:37,974
will come from.
If it's the ethno nationalists on the 

807
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:42,690
right or if it's the radical leftist,
so on the left,

808
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:43,590
who knows?
Right.

809
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:46,260
I,
I suspect to some degree that's a matter

810
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,094
of happenstance.
I mean that's what you'd expect if you 

811
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:54,021
looked at 20th century history,
but I emerged out of the academy and the

812
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,374
academy,
like there are right wing people in the 

813
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:59,880
academy not to speak of.
That's completely,

814
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,910
that's thoroughly documented and 
certainly not the case in a country like

815
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:05,784
Canada.
There's no threat whatsoever in Canada 

816
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,480
from,
from the radical.

817
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:10,500
Right.
It's like,

818
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,950
I don't know if you rounded up everybody
who was on the radical right in Canada,

819
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:14,784
you might be able to scrape up like what
three or 4,000 people if you really 

820
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,370
like,
if you really worked at it,

821
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,280
you know,
so I just don't see that.

822
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:26,010
At least in my own country,
that's just a non issue.

823
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,010
It's a nonstarter.
I mean the last time there was any

824
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,360
kind of radical right wingers in Canada 
was probably in Quebec in the 19 fifties

825
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,270
and maybe from the 19 thirties to the 19
fifties,

826
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,710
but it's never been a political issue.
What about the ASD or the Italian?

827
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,660
I can't remember the name of the Italian
party.

828
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,320
The National Front in France.
Where would you put would you.

829
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:47,981
Oh,
well,

830
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:49,690
I mean you're in Europe.
It's more,

831
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,123
there's more polarization I would say,
but the Europeans also have problems 

832
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:55,720
that we don't have.
You know,

833
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:56,554
they've been,
they've been struggling with the 

834
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:03,421
consequences of non ending violence in 
the Middle East and the wave of refugees

835
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,380
that has emerged as a consequence of 
that.

836
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:09,640
And so the situation in Europe is 
different than I would say there is more

837
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,940
movement and activity on the right,
so,

838
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,190
but,
and you know,

839
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,870
I'm not a admirer of identity politics 
while,

840
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:21,704
and that's for the reasons I brought up 
to begin with think that you have to 

841
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,323
decide

842
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,750
conceptually,
psychologically,

843
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,990
familiarly and socially what your vision
of a human being is.

844
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:36,464
And if your vision of a human being is 
essentially tribal so that you're 

845
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:41,900
defined by your collective identity in 
some manner,

846
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,110
then you're going to play identity 
politics on the left.

847
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:47,180
You're going to play identity politics 
on the right.

848
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,021
It's like,
well,

849
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:48,854
I think the identity politics types on 
the left pose a bigger threat in my 

850
00:48:51,831 --> 00:48:52,664
country.
It's not so obvious in your country 

851
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,184
because you guys,
your political landscape is more 

852
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:58,730
balanced,
I would say,

853
00:48:58,731 --> 00:48:59,564
than ours.
If the radical right posed a threat to 

854
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:05,240
the academy,
which they most decidedly do not,

855
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,550
then I would be just as upset about 
that.

856
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,550
And so I think again,
it's,

857
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,110
it's part and parcel of the radical left
failure to take or the lefts in general,

858
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:17,420
failure to take responsibility for the 
radicals.

859
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:17,870
It's like,
oh,

860
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:18,703
well,
why aren't you criticizing equally on 

861
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:21,680
both sides?
Well,

862
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,850
the threat doesn't exist equally on both
sides,

863
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:27,980
not in my country.
So

864
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,310
I think identity politics is murderous 
game,

865
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:33,720
no matter who plays it,
you know,

866
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,730
and on the left it's,
well,

867
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:36,564
we've already talked about that.
So what's wrong on the right while you 

868
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:40,134
stand up and wave your flag and talk 
about your ethnic identity or your 

869
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:44,640
racial identity and you take pride in 
that.

870
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:45,474
It's like,
what the hell did that have to do with 

871
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:49,350
you yet had goddamn loser?
You know,

872
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,333
it's like you're,
you're one of the great heroes of the 

873
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,261
past,
are you.

874
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:54,300
That's why you're standing up and waving
your flag.

875
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:54,991
It's no,
you're not.

876
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:55,824
You're,
you're identifying with your group 

877
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,250
because you don't have anything of your 
own to offer.

878
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,653
And so it's pathetic.
And I've said that many times and in my 

879
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,070
lectures to,
and people know this,

880
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:07,800
if they've actually watched my 
university lectures,

881
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:13,100
I spend a tremendous amount of time and 
have for 30 years convincing my students

882
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:14,574
that if they had been in Nazi Germany,
there was a very high probability that 

883
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:21,030
rather than being Oskar Schindler and 
rescuing the Jews,

884
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,073
they would have been a Nazi persecutor 
because there's like five Oskar 

885
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,640
Schindler's and like many million Nazis.

886
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,360
So you can do the math for yourself and 
if you don't think that,

887
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,940
if you think that you would have been 
one of the few heroes,

888
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:35,774
then you're either someone truly 
remarkable or you're unbelievably 

889
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:42,224
diluted.
And so I would suspect that you're in 

890
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:48,800
the unbelievably diluted camp because 
truly remarkable people are rare.

891
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:49,783
And I've really.
I've really seen this in the last year 

892
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,600
or two because one of the things I have 
noted,

893
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,230
like I knew that people were timid,
you know,

894
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,570
and I knew why it's dangerous to stick 
your head up above the rest.

895
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,404
I mean its Predator avoidance strategy 
to keep your head down and I mean that 

896
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:05,234
technically it truly is to blend in with
the crowd is a predatory avoidance 

897
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:11,780
strategy.
That's what fish do in schools of fish.

898
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,740
Like it's very low level behavior and if
you stick your head up there's some real

899
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:16,574
danger and the advantage to that is that
people are pretty civilized and they go 

900
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:22,670
along with the group and that's,
that's a good thing because you know,

901
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:24,590
we should be civilized and go along with
the group,

902
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:25,424
but it's a really bad thing when the 
group goes sideways and I've had many 

903
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:31,910
people,
colleagues but many other people to say,

904
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,460
wow,
we agree with what you're doing,

905
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,430
but we can't really take the risk of 
standing up and saying.

906
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,263
So it's like,
well now and then so most people fall 

907
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:44,060
into that camp.
When I went to Queens University a month

908
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,240
ago and was subject to that chilling 
demonstration,

909
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:52,241
I would say were the radicals climbed up
into the stain glass window window wells

910
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:54,510
and pounded,
you know,

911
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,890
unendingly for 90 minutes while we were 
all inside.

912
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,470
I had a professor write me the day 
before and say,

913
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:03,020
look,
my wife and I work at the university,

914
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:03,854
we really support what you're doing,
but we can't even risk coming to the 

915
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:10,670
talk because what if the students see 
and complaint?

916
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,541
It's like,
well,

917
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,900
yeah,
there's courage for you,

918
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,190
man.
There's courage for it,

919
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,710
you know?
And so,

920
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,370
but that's par for the course and it's,
it's unsurprising to some degree.

921
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:20,863
Right.

922
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,470
Well,
but anyways,

923
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:23,490
on the right,
it's like

924
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,560
it's an excuse by people on the left not
to take the things that I'm saying.

925
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:32,970
Seriously.
That's what it is.

926
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:33,571
It's like,
wow,

927
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:35,280
he's not attacking the right as,
as,

928
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,210
as much.
It's like,

929
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,010
well,
they're not after me.

930
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,800
They're not trying to close down my 
speech.

931
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,503
So I took that personally.
So had it been right wingers coming 

932
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:47,250
after me.
Well,

933
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:52,140
it would've been the same thing.
So it's a foolish objection,

934
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,063
I think.

935
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,423
Okay.

936
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,230
For decades,
ethnic groups have,

937
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:03,064
on average,
scored significantly differently on Iq 

938
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:06,124
tests.
According to psychology professor 

939
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:09,214
Richard Hair,
whom you interviewed on your channel 

940
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,570
Youtube,
there was no scientific consensus on the

941
00:53:13,571 --> 00:53:16,630
causes of these average differences in 
Iq test scores.

942
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,250
Yet,
according to Haier,

943
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,323
psychologists do generally agree that 
general intelligence exists that Iq 

944
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:26,160
measures that well and in a non 
culturally

945
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
biased way that Iq is highly predictive 
of success and educational and 

946
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:35,580
professional terms and that for decades 
ethnic groups have on average,

947
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:39,240
scored significantly differently.
So assuming this is true,

948
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,133
should we talk about it?
Sam Harris raised this question and a 

949
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:45,300
podcast conversation with Charles 
Murray.

950
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,853
Some argue that we should not talk about
this as doing so could fuel the racial 

951
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:55,530
supremacist movements that you mentioned
with potentially horrific consequences.

952
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,813
Others mainly on the intellectual 
darkweb and to a very limited extent in 

953
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:01,824
academia.
Think we should talk about this topic 

954
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,740
because average differences in Iq scores
have existed for decades.

955
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:12,360
They may have played a role in 
generating the disparate educational and

956
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:15,540
professional outcomes that we observe 
and care about.

957
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,853
And thus we cannot properly analyze 
these disparate outcomes unless we do 

958
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:23,760
talk about the subject openly.
Geneticists,

959
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,623
David Reich recently argued in the New 
York Times that have scientists do not 

960
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,230
openly discussed the biological basis of
race.

961
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,700
Pseudo scientists could fill the vacuum 
with dangerous consequences.

962
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,350
Furthermore,
you,

963
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:38,184
Professor Peterson are highly critical 
of the oppression narrative that 

964
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:42,834
permeates segments of the academy and 
activist left and knowledge about 

965
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:50,610
average differences in Iq scores between
ethnic groups,

966
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,150
while tough to assimilate could puncture
this narrative.

967
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,690
So the question is,
what is your view on all that?

968
00:54:57,691 --> 00:55:01,140
I've just said she's a.
You guys already didn't take a long time

969
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:02,790
to prepare these questions,
didn't you?

970
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,033
Alright.
So

971
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,440
when I went to Harvard,
I came from mcgill and I had spent a lot

972
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:15,854
of time with my advisor there and a 
research team that he had trying to 

973
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:25,670
understand the genesis of antisocial 
behavior and

974
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,210
among adolescents mostly so well as kids
as well.

975
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,283
Anti social behavior is very persistent.
So if you have a child whose conduct 

976
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,064
disordered at the age of four,
the probability that they will be 

977
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:42,180
criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is 
extremely high.

978
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,103
It's unbelievably stable.
It's a very dismal literature because 

979
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,213
you see these early onset aggressive 
kids and and it's persistent and then 

980
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:53,184
you look at the intervention literature 
and you throw up your hands because no 

981
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:57,384
interventions work and believe me,
psychologists have tried everything you 

982
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:00,894
could possibly imagine and a bunch of 
things that you can't in order to 

983
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,644
ameliorate that.
So we're really interested in trying to 

984
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:08,520
understand,
for example,

985
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,923
if you're antisocial by the age of four,
then there isn't an intervention that 

986
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:15,480
seems to be effective.
So,

987
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,033
and the standard penal logical theory is
really quite horrifying in this regard 

988
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:24,610
because what you see is that male 
aggression around the age of 15 and then

989
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,340
it declines fairly precipitously and,
and,

990
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,790
and sort of normalizes again by the age 
of 27.

991
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,330
And Standard penal logical theory 
essentially is this cold hearted.

992
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:35,164
It's like if you have a mold,
if you have someone who's a multiple 

993
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:38,434
offender,
you just throw them in prison until 

994
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:43,810
they're 27 and then the age out of it 
and that's all there is to it.

995
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,730
That's,
that's what we've got.

996
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,043
Now there's some downside to that 
because there's a corollary literature 

997
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,984
that suggests that the worst thing that 
you can do with antisocial people is to 

998
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:55,270
group them together,
which is what we do in prisons.

999
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,980
So,
so that's a whole mess.

1000
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:57,993
Anyways.
One of the things we were doing was 

1001
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,604
trying to see if there might be 
cognitive predictors of antisocial 

1002
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,294
behavior.
And so we use this battery of 

1003
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,844
neuropsychological tests that was put 
together at the Montreal Neurological 

1004
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,953
Institute,
took about 11 hours to administer and 

1005
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,220
hypothetically assessed prefrontal 
cortical function.

1006
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,910
We computerize that,
reduced it to about 90 minutes.

1007
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:23,020
And then I'm assessed antisocial 
adolescents in,

1008
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,933
in Montreal,
and found out that they did show 

1009
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:29,140
deficits in problem solving ability that
we were associated with,

1010
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,030
uh,
with prefrontal ability.

1011
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,330
Um,
when I got to Harvard,

1012
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:34,811
I thought,
well,

1013
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:35,644
that's interesting.
We could use the neuro psych battery to 

1014
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:39,723
predict negative behavior.
Perhaps we could use it to predict 

1015
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:44,980
positive behavior.
So I thought,

1016
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:45,814
well,
what if we turned the neuro psych 

1017
00:57:46,691 --> 00:57:49,720
battery and over and thought,
well,

1018
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:51,520
can we predict grades,
for example,

1019
00:57:51,521 --> 00:57:53,500
because you know,
that's a decent thing to predict.

1020
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:54,334
So we ran a study,
we ran a study that looked at Harvard 

1021
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:58,624
kids,
University of Toronto kids line workers 

1022
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:05,320
at a Milwaukee factory and managers and 
executives at the same factory.

1023
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,154
And what we found was that the average 
score across these neuro psychological 

1024
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,580
tests,
they were kind of like games.

1025
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:13,840
They were game like,
you know.

1026
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:16,490
So in one,
in one test you had,

1027
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:20,830
there were five lights in the middle of 
the screen and a box was associated with

1028
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,110
each light and you had to learn by trial
and error,

1029
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:25,510
which box was associated with,
with each light.

1030
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,410
That was one of the tests.
Um,

1031
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,223
so we took people's average score across
the tests because they seem to clump 

1032
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:36,970
together into a single structure.
You can do,

1033
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,700
you can find that out statistically.
If you take a bunch of tests,

1034
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,833
you can find out how they clumped 
together statistically by looking at 

1035
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:45,700
their patterns of correlations and you 
might get multiple clumps,

1036
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:49,090
which is what happens with personality 
research where you get five or you might

1037
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:49,924
get a singular clump,
which is what happens in cognitive 

1038
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:55,150
research.
And we got a single plump essentially.

1039
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,433
And then we were trying to figure out if
at the same time I was reading the 

1040
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:00,634
literature on performance prediction and
there's an extensive literature on 

1041
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:04,564
performance prediction.
A lot of it generated by the armed 

1042
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:06,970
forces.
By the way,

1043
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:11,500
I'm indicating that ICU is a very good 
predictor of longterm life success.

1044
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,860
And so here's the.
Here's the general rule.

1045
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:16,863
If your job is simple,
which means you do the same thing 

1046
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,740
everyday than Iq predicts how fast learn
the job,

1047
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:25,280
but not how well you you do it.
But if your job is complex,

1048
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,370
which means that the demands change on 
an ongoing basis,

1049
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:31,430
then the best predictor of success is 
general cognitive ability.

1050
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,210
And uh,
and I learned that the general cognitive

1051
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:38,990
ability tests clump together into a 
single factor that's fluid intelligence.

1052
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:39,824
Or or ICU,
and then we didn't know if the factor 

1053
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:42,674
that we had found was the same factor as
Iq and it and we still haven't really 

1054
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:47,864
figured out whether or not that was the 
case because it kind of depends on how 

1055
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:51,560
you do the analysis,
but anyways,

1056
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:55,340
I got deeply into the performance 
prediction literature and I found out,

1057
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,203
well,
if you want to predict people's 

1058
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:58,100
performance in life,
there's.

1059
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,900
There's a couple of things you need to 
know.

1060
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,760
You need to know their general cognitive
ability.

1061
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:02,594
If they're going to do a complex job,
you need to know their trait 

1062
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,134
conscientiousness.
Some of you might've heard that 

1063
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,810
rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act 
by the way,

1064
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,380
because it's a good predictor of 
longterm life success.

1065
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,940
Freedom from negative emotion.
Low neuroticism is another predictor,

1066
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:24,350
but it's sorta third on the hierarchy 
and then openness to experience which is

1067
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,770
a personality trait,
is associated with expertise in creative

1068
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:28,604
domains.
The evidence that now I should tell you 

1069
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,240
since it's such a complicated question,
I should tell you how to make an Iq test

1070
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,930
because actually really easy and you 
need to know this to actually understand

1071
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:43,280
what I que it,
so imagine that you generated a a set of

1072
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,530
10,000 questions.
Okay.

1073
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:48,320
About anything.
It could be math problems.

1074
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,510
They could be general knowledge,
they could be vocabulary,

1075
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:51,344
that could be multiple choice and really
doesn't matter what they're about as 

1076
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,520
long as they require abstraction to 
Seoul,

1077
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,960
so they'd be formulated linguistically,
but mathematically would also apply.

1078
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,080
And then you have those 10,000 
questions.

1079
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:07,850
Now you take a random set of 100 of 
those questions and you've given them to

1080
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:11,390
a thousand people and all you do is sum 
up the answers right from.

1081
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,583
So some people are going to get most of 
them right and some of some of them are 

1082
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:15,194
going to get most of them wrong.
You just rank order the people in terms 

1083
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:21,140
of their score,
correct that for age and you have Iq.

1084
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,363
That's all there is to it,
and what you'll find is that no matter 

1085
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:27,740
which random set of 100 questions you 
take,

1086
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,110
the people at the top of one random set 
will be at the top of all the others and

1087
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,800
and with very,
very,

1088
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:35,150
very high consistency.

1089
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,360
So one thing you need to know is that if
any social science claims whatsoever are

1090
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:41,564
correct,
then the ICU claims are correct because 

1091
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:47,084
the ICU claims are more psychometrically
rigorous than any other phenomena 

1092
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,600
phenomenon that's been discovered by 
social scientists.

1093
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:54,883
Now,
the ICU literature is a dismal 

1094
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:57,620
literature.
No one likes it.

1095
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:59,390
Here's why.
Here's an example.

1096
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,630
So here's a little,
here's a fun little fact for you,

1097
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,733
for Liberals and conservatives alike,
because conservatives think there's a 

1098
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:06,644
job for everyone.
If people just get off their asses and 

1099
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:10,010
get to work and liberals think,
well,

1100
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:12,020
you can train anyone to do anything.
It's like,

1101
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,230
no,
there isn't a job for everyone and no,

1102
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,380
you can't train everyone to do 
everything that's wrong.

1103
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,820
And here's one of the consequences of 
that.

1104
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,193
So as I mentioned,
the Armed Forces has done a lot of work 

1105
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,490
on ICU when they started back in 19,
19,

1106
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,680
and the reason they did that was 
because,

1107
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,510
well for obvious reasons,
say let's say there's a war and you want

1108
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:34,344
to get qualified people into the officer
positions as rapidly as possible or 

1109
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:38,394
you'll lose.

1110
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,010
So that's a reason.
Now,

1111
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:44,940
the armed forces has experimented with 
Iq tests since 19,

1112
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:45,774
19 and in the last 20 years I'm a law 
was passed as a consequence of that 

1113
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:51,594
analysis,
which was that it was illegal to induct 

1114
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:56,700
anyone into the armed forces who had an 
Iq of less than 83.

1115
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,823
Now the question is why?
And that answer was all of that effort 

1116
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:06,120
put in by the armed forces indicated 
that if you had an Iq of 83 or less,

1117
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:06,954
there wasn't anything that you could be 
trained to do in the military that 

1118
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:12,810
wasn't positively counterproductive.
Now you got to think about that a,

1119
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:17,420
because the military is chronically 
desperate for people right there.

1120
01:03:17,421 --> 01:03:20,760
It's not like they're sort of like 
people are lining up to be inducted,

1121
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,070
right?
They have to go out and recruit and it's

1122
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:23,904
not easy and so they're desperate to get
their hands on every body they can 

1123
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:30,170
possibly manage and then especially in 
wartime,

1124
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,730
but also in peace time,
but then there was another reason too,

1125
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:33,564
which was the armed forces,
was also set up from a policy 

1126
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:38,820
perspective to take people in the 
underclass,

1127
01:03:38,821 --> 01:03:41,760
let's say,
and train them and move them up at least

1128
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,500
into the working class or maybe the 
middle class.

1129
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,040
So there's a policy element to it too.
And so even from that perspective,

1130
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:50,190
you can see that the military is 
desperate to bring people in,

1131
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:54,000
but it all with an Iq of 83 or less,
it's not happening.

1132
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,913
Okay,
so how many people have an Iq of 83 or 

1133
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,134
less?

1134
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,080
Ten percent.

1135
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,730
Now,
if that doesn't,

1136
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,270
if that doesn't hurt you to hear,
then you didn't hear it properly.

1137
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,610
Because what it implies is that in a 
complex society like ours and one that's

1138
01:04:15,611 --> 01:04:16,444
becoming increasingly complex,
there isn't anything for 10 percent of 

1139
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:22,960
the population to do.
Alright,

1140
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,820
well what are we going to do?
We're going to ignore that.

1141
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,730
We're going to run away from that and 
believe me,

1142
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,564
we have every reason to,
or we're going to contend with the fact 

1143
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:34,090
that we need to figure out how it is,
how it is,

1144
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,013
how it might be possible to find a place
for people on the lower end of the 

1145
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:45,091
general cognitive distribution to take 
their productive and worthwhile place in

1146
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,740
society.
And that isn't just going to be a matter

1147
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:48,574
of dumping money down the hierarchy 
because giving people who have nothing 

1148
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:55,150
to do money isn't helpful.
It doesn't work.

1149
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,060
It's not that simple.
Well,

1150
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,583
so that's kind of an answer to the 
question of whether or not we should 

1151
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,410
deal with,
uh,

1152
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,480
with Iq forthrightly.
It's like,

1153
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,890
if you can find a flaw in that logic,
like just go right ahead.

1154
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:12,220
It's not like I was thrilled to death to
discover all of this by nose,

1155
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,800
by no stretch of the imagination.
Was that the case?

1156
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,890
So,
so what?

1157
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:22,030
So Iq is reliable and valid.
That's the first thing.

1158
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:26,230
It's more reliable and valid than any 
other psychometric test ever designed by

1159
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:29,710
social scientists by a factor of about 
three.

1160
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,353
That's fact number one.
Fact number two is it predicts longterm 

1161
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:38,020
life outcome at about point three,
point four,

1162
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,093
which leaves about 85 percent,
70 to 85 percent of the story 

1163
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:42,634
unexplained,
but it's still the best thing that we 

1164
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:45,940
have.
Well,

1165
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,670
it's also the case that in places like 
Great Britain,

1166
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,313
when Iq tests were first introduced,
they were actually used by the 

1167
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:53,644
socialists and they were used to 
identify poor people who had potential 

1168
01:05:59,020 --> 01:05:59,853
cognitive potential and to move them 
into higher Ed Institutes of higher 

1169
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:03,724
education.
So there's an upside social upside as 

1170
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:09,700
well.
Ethnic differences.

1171
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,023
This is something you can't say anything
about without without immediately being 

1172
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,380
killed.
So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,

1173
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,513
but I'll tell you one thing that I did 
in the last week that's relevant to 

1174
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:25,510
this.
So the,

1175
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,180
and this just shows you how complex the 
problem is.

1176
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,103
First of all,
we should point out that race is a very 

1177
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:33,400
difficult thing to define because racial
boundaries aren't tight,

1178
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,773
right?
So and so when you talk about racial 

1179
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:37,900
differences in Iq,
you,

1180
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,680
you're faced with a thorny problem of 
defining race and now it's a big problem

1181
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:42,514
from a scientific perspective.
But we'll leave that aside and I wrote 

1182
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:50,650
an article this week,
somebody stood up at one point,

1183
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,550
one of my talks and vice bless their 
hearts,

1184
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:55,803
took this particular question and used 
it as an indication of the quality of 

1185
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,510
the people who are my so called 
followers.

1186
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:04,240
And by the way,
the quality of my so called followers is

1187
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:05,290
pretty damn high.

1188
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,393
And you can find that out quite rapidly 
just by going looking at the youtube 

1189
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:10,264
comments which are head and shoulders 
above what the standard set of youtube 

1190
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:14,890
comments.
I can tell you that.

1191
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,240
So someone asked me the both the Jewish 
question,

1192
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,740
right?
And the,

1193
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:25,830
the implication it was actually someone 
Jewish and the implication was that Jews

1194
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:30,670
are overrepresented in positions of 
authority and power and,

1195
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:32,103
and I was,
had just spoken for like an hour and a 

1196
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:35,224
half and you know,
this guy had an ax to grind and I 

1197
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:39,970
thought there is no God damn way I'm 
getting into this at the moment.

1198
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,990
And so I,
I said I'm,

1199
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:45,640
I said I can't answer that question,
but that's not a very good answer.

1200
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:47,830
So I wrote a blog post this week and I 
said,

1201
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:48,640
look,
here's the,

1202
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,530
here's the situation,
all right,

1203
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,730
Jews are overrepresented in positions of
power and authority,

1204
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,250
but then let's open our eyes a little 
bit.

1205
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,890
Hey and thank for like two or three 
seconds and think,

1206
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:00,843
hey,
guess what?

1207
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,833
They're also overrepresented in 
positions of competence and it's not 

1208
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:08,020
like we have more geniuses than we know 
what to do with.

1209
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,570
And if the Jews happened to be producing
more of them,

1210
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,950
which they are,
by the way,

1211
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,560
then that's a pretty good thing for the 
rest of us.

1212
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,570
So let's not confuse competence with 
power and authority,

1213
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:18,404
even though that's a favorite trick of 
the radical leftists who always failed 

1214
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:22,970
to make that distinction.
Well,

1215
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:28,180
why does this over representation occur?
Because it does it also.

1216
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,640
There's also overrepresentation in 
political movements,

1217
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,430
including radical political movements.
Okay?

1218
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,360
Why?
Well,

1219
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,720
answer one Jewish conspiracy.
Okay.

1220
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:41,150
That's not a very good answer.
We've had,

1221
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,740
we've used that answer before.
Alright,

1222
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,920
but,
but do we have an alternative?

1223
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,300
Well,
here's an alternative.

1224
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:52,580
The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere 
between 1:10 and one slash 15,

1225
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:56,750
which is about one standard deviation 
above the population average.

1226
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,870
And so what that means is that the 
average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has

1227
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:07,361
an Iq that's higher than 85 percent of 
the population that's a lot higher now.

1228
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,710
That doesn't make that much difference 
in the middle of the distribution.

1229
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,663
Okay?
But geniuses don't exist at the middle 

1230
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:16,244
of the distribution.
They exist at the tails of the 

1231
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:18,974
distribution and you don't need much of 
a move at the mean to produce walloping 

1232
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:24,644
differences at the tails.
And the tails are important because a 

1233
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:28,034
lot of where we draw,
we draw exceptional people from the 

1234
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:33,170
exceptions.
Right?

1235
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:34,004
So here's an example.
Here's another example of the same 

1236
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:38,540
thing.
Most engineers are male.

1237
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,363
Why?
Because men are more interested in 

1238
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:46,040
things and women are more interested in 
people and you might say,

1239
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,750
well that's sociocultural.
It's like,

1240
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,340
no,
it's not.

1241
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:53,500
And we know that because if you stack up
countries by their,

1242
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,330
by their egalitarianism,
social policies,

1243
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:58,220
which you can do quite effectively.

1244
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,203
And then you look at the 
overrepresentation of men in stem 

1245
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,044
fields,
the overrepresentation increases as the 

1246
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:10,790
countries become more egalitarian.
So it's not socio cultural,

1247
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:14,810
okay,
now men aren't that much more interested

1248
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,300
in things than women.
It's one standard deviation,

1249
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,190
which is about the same difference by 
the way,

1250
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,770
between the population norm in the 
Ashkenazi Jews.

1251
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:22,843
But if you're looking at the person who 
the one person in 20 or the one person 

1252
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:31,271
in 50 who's most who's hyper interested 
in things and that's likely to become an

1253
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,670
engineer,
then most of them are men.

1254
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,130
Here's another example of the same 
thing.

1255
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:38,803
Men are more aggressive than women.
Now you might ask how much and now 

1256
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,340
answered.
That is best place to look at that as in

1257
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,174
Sweden where the egalitarian policies 
have been laid out for a long period of 

1258
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:51,074
time and you can.
You can get a more direct inference 

1259
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:53,864
about biology.

1260
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,123
If you took a random man in around 
random woman out of the population and 

1261
01:10:58,611 --> 01:10:59,444
you had to bet on who was more 
aggressive and you bet on the man you'd 

1262
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:05,060
be right 60 percent of the time.
So that's not that much,

1263
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:05,511
right?
It's,

1264
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,930
it's deviates from 50 slash 50,
but it's not like 90 10.

1265
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,820
It's 60 slash 40.
Okay.

1266
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,440
So,
so what does that mean?

1267
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,840
Well,
we got a tail problem here.

1268
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:16,674
Again,
let's say that now you decide to go out 

1269
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:18,954
onto the extremes of aggression and you 
identify the most aggressive one in 100 

1270
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,970
persons.
They're all men.

1271
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,180
Guess who's in prison?
Those people.

1272
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,480
That's why most of the people in prison 
are men.

1273
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:34,893
And so this is elementary part of the 
problem in our society is that we don't 

1274
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:39,204
understand statistics.
We don't understand that you can have 

1275
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:42,534
relatively small differences at the 
population level that produce walloping 

1276
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:49,410
consequences at the tails of the 
distribution.

1277
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,750
Okay.
So back to ICU.

1278
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,000
One final thing to say about Iq.

1279
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,560
The ethnic differences are difficult to 
dispense with.

1280
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,370
It's not easy to make them go away.
You can say,

1281
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:09,120
well the tests aren't culture fair.
Well here's the past of that.

1282
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:12,600
So imagine you,
you task group a with an Iq test and you

1283
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:13,434
test group B with an Iq test and then 
you look at their actual performance in 

1284
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:18,474
whatever you're predicting.
If the test was biased against ethnic 

1285
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:22,404
group A,
then it would under predict their 

1286
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:28,260
performance and that doesn't happen.
Now you could say,

1287
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,330
well,
there's systemic bias in the performance

1288
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:34,230
measures and the potential measures and 
that's a possibility.

1289
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,370
All right.
Now one other thing about that.

1290
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,853
There's a real danger in the ethnicity 
Iq debate and the danger is that we 

1291
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,643
confuse intelligence with value or that 
we include we we confuse intelligence 

1292
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,040
with yet with human value.
That's a better way of thinking about it

1293
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,233
and one of the things that we're going 
to have to understand here is that 

1294
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,374
that's a mistake,
is that being more intelligent doesn't 

1295
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:04,980
make you a better person.

1296
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,443
That's not the case.
It makes you more useful for complex 

1297
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:13,140
cognitive operations,
but you can be pretty damn horrific as a

1298
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:15,420
genius son of a bitch,
right?

1299
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:16,254
It's morally neutral,
and we also know that from the 

1300
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:19,020
psychometric data.
By the way,

1301
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:19,854
there doesn't seem to be any 
relationship whatsoever between 

1302
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,104
intelligence and virtue,
and so if it does turn out that nature 

1303
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:29,970
and the fates do not align with our 
egalitarianism presuppositions,

1304
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:30,804
which is highly probable,
we shouldn't therefore make the mistake 

1305
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:38,061
of assuming that if group a or person a 
is lower on one of these attributes than

1306
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:42,390
group B or person b,
that that is somehow reflective of their

1307
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:45,510
intrinsic value as human beings.
That's a big mistake.

1308
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,890
No,
that's why I don't have anything else to

1309
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,890
say about that.
Okay.

1310
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,220
So,
um,

1311
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,480
I had three more questions and so maybe 
slightly shorter answers to these three,

1312
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,760
like maybe around.
Hopefully there are simpler questions.

1313
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:09,300
Average,
average five minutes.

1314
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:10,950
Um,
and then.

1315
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,190
And then we will open it up.

1316
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:17,190
So another taboo is to celebrate 
European culture.

1317
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:24,390
Multiculturalists get pretty unhappy 
when Europeans start expressing pride in

1318
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:27,040
their culture or heritage.
Many,

1319
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:30,580
especially on the left,
do not draw much of a distinction,

1320
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,600
at least in practice between European 
pride and white supremacy.

1321
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,540
You care about freedom of the 
individual,

1322
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,720
the individual's freedom to think,
to speak,

1323
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,583
to associate in short,
to act as he sees fit without external 

1324
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:45,964
compulsion,
as long as he doesn't infringe on the 

1325
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:52,050
similar liberties of others.
Professor Ricardo do shame.

1326
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,203
A historical sociologists and professor 
at the University of New Brunswick 

1327
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:56,764
argues that quote,
individualism is a unique attribute of 

1328
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:02,980
European peoples.
Quote,

1329
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:06,130
it has been exported to some degree to 
other nations,

1330
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,113
but in my view,
it is not something that comes to them 

1331
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:12,070
naturally,
so he continues.

1332
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,023
Quote,
you can't play the game of we're all 

1333
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:16,174
individuals.
We have to affirm and be proud of our 

1334
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:24,301
ethnic identity and heritage to preserve
the West's curious individualism.

1335
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,090
If Europeans have become minorities in 
the west,

1336
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:32,740
he argues the founding idea of the West,
that no entity,

1337
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,750
not an individual,
not a community,

1338
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:38,440
not the state congested.
We deprive an individual of life,

1339
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:40,360
liberty,
or property by force,

1340
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,210
no matter what the individual's race,
class or religion.

1341
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:48,130
I wouldn't be surprised if Dushane when 
he made this statement,

1342
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:49,120
had you in mind.

1343
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:54,110
Look,
the

1344
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,013
medieval Europeans identified seven 
deadly sins for reason and one of them 

1345
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:03,190
was pride.
It's like,

1346
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:04,863
let's make the presumption.
I do believe that for for reasons that 

1347
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:14,080
aren't obvious that the west has got 
some things right.

1348
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,450
We've got the sovereignty of the 
individual,

1349
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:17,284
right?
That's the most fundamental thing we've 

1350
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:19,900
got,
right?

1351
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,110
We've articulated that I think in a,
in a remarkable way,

1352
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:23,944
not only theologically,
philosophically in her body of laws and 

1353
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:28,924
our societies,
and one of the consequences of that as 

1354
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:35,560
it's had its effect on the rest of the 
world is that everyone is getting richer

1355
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:37,990
quite fast and that's a really good 
thing.

1356
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,300
Okay.
Having said that,

1357
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:41,650
it's like,
am I proud of that?

1358
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,570
It's like,
I didn't do that.

1359
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,570
What the hell?
Pride.

1360
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:50,530
What's that?
That's not the right response.

1361
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,470
How about responsibility for that?
How would that be?

1362
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,230
It's like you're a part of.
This is great

1363
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,953
and unlikely set of propositions.
This strange set of propositions that 

1364
01:17:03,011 --> 01:17:08,011
says that in some ineffable manner,
the poorest person is as valuable as the

1365
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,240
king.
It's like,

1366
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:12,950
how the hell did we ever figure that 
out?

1367
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,340
That's an impossible thing to think,
and yet that's the,

1368
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,210
that's the bedrock of our legal system.
That's nothing to be proud of.

1369
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,223
That's something to tremble before to 
take on as an ethical burden and not to 

1370
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,074
wave a flag for how wonderful you are 
that you happened to have the same skin 

1371
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:32,690
color as some of the people who thought 
that up.

1372
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,640
It's not the right response.
It's like it's,

1373
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:40,610
it's to open your eyes and recognize 
that as a miracle and a relatively,

1374
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:41,783
uh,
relatively new miracle on the world 

1375
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:43,814
stage and to,
and to participate in the process of 

1376
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,010
upholding that in your personal and your
public life.

1377
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,143
That's not pride in European tradition.
Like when I go to Europe and I love 

1378
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:58,790
going to Europe and the European cities 
are there unbelievable masterpieces,

1379
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:02,000
which is why they're completely flooded 
by pilgrims,

1380
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:02,420
right?

1381
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,253
Tourists,
pilgrims who go there to look at the 

1382
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,200
beauty.
So again,

1383
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:08,780
I don't feel pride about that.
I feel.

1384
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:13,700
I feel like I have something to live up 
to that's not the same thing man.

1385
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,280
And so these right wingers in this,
it's like,

1386
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:17,720
look what we've done.
It's like,

1387
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:20,150
no,
it's not you that did that.

1388
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,003
That's something mad you gotta.
You GotTa have your act together before 

1389
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:25,820
you would dare to say,
well,

1390
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:26,960
that was me.
It's like,

1391
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:27,740
yeah,
sure,

1392
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,270
sure it was you.
Yeah,

1393
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,780
right.
No,

1394
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,640
it's hard to stand up and take your 
place in that,

1395
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,450
in that kind of historical process,
that unlikely,

1396
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:43,451
miraculous historical process,
not to just feel ashamed at the way that

1397
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:46,890
you're presently constituted in the face
of that means that you're.

1398
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,773
You're diluted and you're using your,
your your great fortune of being a 

1399
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:57,710
beneficiary of that system.
Look at what we've got here,

1400
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,800
this great pace that we're inhabiting 
right now.

1401
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,170
You're using your unearned,

1402
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:07,893
the unearned gift that's been granted to
you as a source of personal pride in 

1403
01:19:12,131 --> 01:19:16,090
your accomplishments do to your skin.
It's like,

1404
01:19:16,091 --> 01:19:18,130
no,
not good.

1405
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,650
Not a good argument.
So,

1406
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:25,360
and that doesn't mean that while there's
nothing valuable about European culture,

1407
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:28,960
there's plenty.
There's plenty about it that's value.

1408
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,450
It's not even so clear to what degree 
it's European.

1409
01:19:31,451 --> 01:19:32,980
I mean,
it came out of the Middle East,

1410
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:33,814
you know,
mean who it's so muddle headed that you 

1411
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:38,704
hardly know where to start,
so hopefully that was less than five 

1412
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:43,750
minutes.
There we go.

1413
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,770
Dispensed with the radical right wingers
in four minutes.

1414
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,863
I've heard a number of interesting 
things about Islam from you and one of 

1415
01:19:52,271 --> 01:19:54,580
your intellectual soul.
Nate's Camille Talia,

1416
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,173
Talia says that men and women benefit in
many ways from living and largely 

1417
01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:01,264
separate worlds as they did and 
traditional European societies and 

1418
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,970
obviously as they do in much of the 
Muslim world.

1419
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:12,090
Relatedly,
Polya considers passionate masculinity a

1420
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:15,870
critical force for defending,
sustaining and advancing civilization,

1421
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:20,640
and she argues the passionate 
masculinity while virtually moribund and

1422
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:24,900
the western middle and upper classes is 
alive and well in the Muslim world.

1423
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:29,550
You have expressed some sympathy for the
Muslim critique of the West.

1424
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,400
It's godlessness.
It's spiritual void.

1425
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,293
It's materialism.
It's technology induced removal from 

1426
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:36,864
life's elemental realities.
You've said it is extraordinarily naive 

1427
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:42,024
to believe that the,
that the differences between European 

1428
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:47,970
culture and Islamic culture are not 
about anything fundamental.

1429
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,680
You've expressed concern that Islam is a
totalizing system,

1430
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:53,903
and in a quote that stood out to me,
you said in a Patrion chat on youtube 

1431
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:01,680
that in your view quote,
the only countries in the world that are

1432
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:02,514
essentially worth living in in any real 
sense are the ones that are predicated 

1433
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:07,404
on the Judeo Christian tradition and 
manifested in the western body of laws 

1434
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,680
unquote.
So an open ended question,

1435
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,753
how would you synthesize your 
perspective on Islam and the fact that 

1436
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:20,160
the Muslim populations of Europe and 
Canada,

1437
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:25,260
a product of recent immigration are 
growing and reproducing much faster than

1438
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:27,810
the European descended populations in 
these countries?

1439
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,753
Yeah,
and you guys already did spend a lot of 

1440
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:33,460
time coming up with troublesome 
questions,

1441
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:34,294
didn't you?

1442
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:41,390
When we get,
we can see the problem is the problem.

1443
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,583
One of the problems is is that I'm an 
ignorant man and there's lots of things 

1444
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:49,370
that I don't know.
No one I don't know.

1445
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,293
I don't understand Islam.
I don't know enough about it to be an 

1446
01:21:53,751 --> 01:21:54,584
intelligent commentary on it.
I've done my best to peck away at the 

1447
01:21:58,971 --> 01:22:00,280
edges,
but you know,

1448
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,183
it would require multiple years of study
to understand the similarities and 

1449
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:07,634
differences between the two viewpoints.
It looks to me like what Islam did was 

1450
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,003
take a group of radically disparate 
tribes and unite them under a single 

1451
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,860
ethos.
Of course,

1452
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:29,270
the in the Muslim civilization expanded 
more rapidly than any other civilization

1453
01:22:29,271 --> 01:22:31,170
ever had and and,
and,

1454
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,380
and occupied a very large part of the 
world,

1455
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:38,381
which of course it still does.
Perhaps there's something to be said for

1456
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:44,081
that unifying tendency.
There is a problem

1457
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,780
and maybe this is at the core of the 
problem.

1458
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:02,540
There is no distinction between Church 
and state in Islam

1459
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,180
and there is a between church and state 
in the West.

1460
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,083
It isn't obvious to me if it's the case 
that our culture is grounded in an 

1461
01:23:16,471 --> 01:23:19,790
underlying,
let's call it literary metaphysics,

1462
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:21,990
something like that.
A religious metaphysic.

1463
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:24,883
Part of the bedrock of our culture is 
the idea of the separation between 

1464
01:23:28,611 --> 01:23:31,760
church and state and as far as I can 
tell,

1465
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,133
that idea doesn't exist in the Muslim 
world and so I cannot understand how 

1466
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:41,180
that faith is commensurate with the 
institution's of the West.

1467
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,193
It doesn't seem to me that there's any 
evidence that it's commensurate because 

1468
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:51,120
the number of Islamic democracies is,
let's call it finite.

1469
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:57,030
The best example is probably been Turkey
and Turkey as far as I can tell,

1470
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,313
isn't doing that well at the moment on 
the Democratic Front and it looked like 

1471
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:06,030
the great shining hope and Lord that was
a consequence of secularization.

1472
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:15,903
You know,
I've spent a lot of time when I was 

1473
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:17,974
reading maps of meaning for example,
looking for commonalities among 

1474
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:25,150
religious viewpoints and I was able to 
find deep commonalities.

1475
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:28,810
I thought between Buddhism and 
Christianity and daoism and Christianity

1476
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,644
and Hinduism and Christianity for that 
matter was a lot harder when it came to 

1477
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,860
Islam.
It's not a faith that's opened itself up

1478
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:37,990
to me.
I don't understand it well,

1479
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,023
but I hope that people of goodwill
can build a bridge between the two 

1480
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:59,970
cultures because the alternative is to 
glue me to contemplate,

1481
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,933
and finally you've stated quote,
women are more agreeable by nature than 

1482
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:15,580
men and agreeable people are 
compassionate toward those.

1483
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:19,780
They see a suffering and that seems to 
include any minority,

1484
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,640
especially when you combine that with a 
kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims

1485
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:28,360
that anyone who has an advantage swiped 
it unquote.

1486
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:34,180
Women have been voting for a century now
and this you suggested in a patrion chat

1487
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:39,450
may help to explain why in the West,
we've collectively decided that quote,

1488
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,653
egalitarianism and conflict avoidance 
constitute the two highest virtues and 

1489
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:49,030
trump everything else,
including free speech unquote.

1490
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,423
You've said that in the West today,
we are perhaps for the first time in 

1491
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:59,740
history seeing on the political left or 
on segments of the political left quote,

1492
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:03,130
what a female totalitarianism would look
like,

1493
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,273
unquote

1494
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,833
elaborate.
I did a research project with one of my 

1495
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:13,154
students.
We haven't published it unfortunately 

1496
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:18,590
for a variety of reasons.
She's been quite ill and I've been quite

1497
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,453
preoccupied.
So those are the two barriers at the 

1498
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,084
moment,
but the first thing we wanted to do was 

1499
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:29,090
to find out whether there was actually 
such a thing as political correctness.

1500
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:31,880
You can actually do that technically as 
a social scientist.

1501
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:35,150
So what you do is,
this is what we did is we got a group of

1502
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:35,984
people together and we collected a whole
bunch of statements that seem to be 

1503
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:41,060
vaguely associated with the idea of 
political correctness.

1504
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:41,894
So maybe you could think,
well it's a media construct and that's 

1505
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:44,444
fine.
You can go analyze media statements and 

1506
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:46,754
then you can collect ideas that seem to 
be associated with whatever political 

1507
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:54,170
correctness is.
We collected about 400 of those and then

1508
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:55,004
we asked,
we turned them into questions and we 

1509
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:58,460
asked a thousand people for their 
opinions.

1510
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,200
Then you can do this statistical process
called factor analysis and it's the same

1511
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:06,440
thing that pulls out a single factor of 
Iq from a group of questions.

1512
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:07,274
For example,
it's the same thing that produced the 

1513
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,014
big five personality model.
What the factor analysis does is tell 

1514
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:16,250
you which quest if questions grouped 
together.

1515
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,650
So let's say you have an opinion,
a,

1516
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,570
well,
if you have an opinion,

1517
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:21,590
a,
if there's 100 of you,

1518
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:22,424
everyone who has an opinion,
a also has an opinion be an opinion 

1519
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:26,780
seat.
And if that's the case,

1520
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:27,614
then those clump together,
there's something about them that's the 

1521
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:30,770
same.
Now,

1522
01:27:30,771 --> 01:27:34,400
what we could have found was that when 
we analyze these 400 questions,

1523
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:37,850
there was like 50 clumps and so that 
would have blown.

1524
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,050
There's such a thing as political 
correctness hypothesis out of the water,

1525
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,540
but that isn't what happened.
We found two clumps,

1526
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,583
one of which looked like something like 
moderate left and the other that looked 

1527
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,800
very much like totalitarian political 
correctness.

1528
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,800
And it was very,
very robust finding.

1529
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:55,993
And we replicated it as well.
She did this for her master's thesis by 

1530
01:27:58,701 --> 01:27:59,534
the way.
Um,

1531
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,350
and then we looked at what predicted 
these beliefs.

1532
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:04,603
First of all,
that the correlation between the 

1533
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:06,764
moderate leftist clump of questions and 
the radical leftist clump of questions 

1534
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:13,760
actually wasn't very high.
And so one of the things that we surmise

1535
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:14,594
is that there's an actual division on 
the left between the moderates and the 

1536
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:17,774
radicals.
And that's just not played itself out 

1537
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:21,164
and I think you can actually see that 
happening by the proclivity of the 

1538
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:26,510
radical leftists to devour themselves.
Right?

1539
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:28,490
So which happens on a very regular 
basis,

1540
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:32,770
or perhaps you can see it in the 
proclivity of the radical left,

1541
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:33,604
is to go after the moderates.
When the moderates criticize the 

1542
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:37,070
radicals,
whatever.

1543
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,590
So there's two clumps to political 
correctness.

1544
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:43,100
Both of them were predicted by trait 
agreeableness,

1545
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:46,430
which is one of the traits that women 
score higher on than men.

1546
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,620
It's the antithesis of aggression by the
way.

1547
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,933
And by also by being female,
which was a real shock to us because 

1548
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:54,344
most of the,
so let's say females and males differ 

1549
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:59,060
with regards to some outcome.
You try to figure out why that is.

1550
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,013
It might be just because they're female.
There's all sorts of things associated 

1551
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:06,330
with being female or male that are like 
second order complications.

1552
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:09,660
What we found almost invariably with the
personality literatures,

1553
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:10,494
if you look at differences between men 
and women and then you control for 

1554
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:15,270
personality,
the differences go away.

1555
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,850
So they're not differences between men 
and women per se.

1556
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:19,860
There are differences between 
personality,

1557
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,120
but with political correctness,
we found ineffective,

1558
01:29:22,121 --> 01:29:24,600
effective agreeableness,
which was a pure personality affect.

1559
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,583
Aaron didn't effective of being female.
So we also found a pronounced effect of 

1560
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:29,664
having taken at least one seminar that 
was politically correct in its 

1561
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:35,190
orientation,
so that had a walloping effect.

1562
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:40,800
So there does seem to be something about
political according to that research,

1563
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:41,634
which,
you know,

1564
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:45,450
it's all right,
try to rely on better research,

1565
01:29:45,451 --> 01:29:48,850
but none has been done.
So that's the best that I got in.

1566
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:51,300
And the woman who did this research is 
very,

1567
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:54,330
very smart and the study was well done.
So I think it's credible.

1568
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,733
So I.
One of the things that's interesting to 

1569
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:00,650
me about that is that it does tie into 
the Freud,

1570
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,870
the and nightmare of devouring mother 
essentially,

1571
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:04,704
which was Freud's,
I think signal contribution to 

1572
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:07,550
psychopathology.
You know,

1573
01:30:07,551 --> 01:30:08,384
for most,
most of Freud's clients were people who 

1574
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:13,620
were struggling to get out of the 
clutches of their family.

1575
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:14,783
Right.
And part of that is human beings are 

1576
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:17,190
very dependent,
right?

1577
01:30:17,191 --> 01:30:18,030
Because,
well,

1578
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:21,030
because we have this incredibly long 
period of development.

1579
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,360
Thirty years maybe,
but certainly 18 years,

1580
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:28,100
and so it's hard to struggle up from 
infancy,

1581
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:32,190
mature and leave as an independent 
creature and lots of people,

1582
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:33,840
you see this in,
if you're a clinician,

1583
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:34,740
you see this all the time.

1584
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:35,573
People are so tangled up in their 
families that they can't get away from 

1585
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,950
them and that's the typical situation 
that Freud described.

1586
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:42,130
So,
so,

1587
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:45,960
uh,
so brilliantly and young also elaborated

1588
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:46,794
on it.
A lot of that's a consequence of hyper 

1589
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:50,100
dependence,
right?

1590
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:53,610
It's,
it's the danger of over protection.

1591
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:57,180
Now there's a rule if you're dealing 
with elderly people,

1592
01:30:57,181 --> 01:31:00,180
say in an elder care institution,
and the rule is something like,

1593
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,360
don't do anything for your charges that 
they can do themselves.

1594
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:05,510
It's kind of a harsh rule,
you know,

1595
01:31:05,511 --> 01:31:07,320
if you see someone struggling with their
buttons,

1596
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:10,350
maybe they're three years old,
you want to rush over and help.

1597
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,393
It's like,
well,

1598
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:16,410
maybe you don't because they need to 
learn how to do up there damn buttons or

1599
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:20,250
if there are 85,
they need to maintain their independence

1600
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:22,590
as much as possible without your 
compassion.

1601
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:24,180
Stealing it from them.

1602
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:26,243
Okay,
well we could hypothesize that there 

1603
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:29,004
would be no pathobiology as a 
consequence of the female rise to 

1604
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:32,784
political power,
but given that females are human beings 

1605
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:36,384
too,
and we're pretty much rife with 

1606
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:37,973
pathology,
the probability that there'll be a 

1607
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:40,434
downside is like there is two male 
participation which would be more 

1608
01:31:44,461 --> 01:31:46,350
aggressive and hyper and hyper 
competent,

1609
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:47,184
aggressiveness and hypercompetition.
The probability that there would be a 

1610
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:50,454
downside is extraordinarily high.
Well why wouldn't it be a downside 

1611
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:54,114
associated with hyper protectiveness?
It's exactly what you'd expect and then 

1612
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:58,374
what you see playing out in the 
political as far as I'm as far as I can 

1613
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:03,160
tell,
and maybe I'm wrong,

1614
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:06,760
is wherever there's a negative quality,
there's an oppressor,

1615
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:07,773
oppression narrative,
and so anyone who's stacks up at the 

1616
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:11,854
bottom of a hierarchy is a victim slash 
infant and anyone at the top is an 

1617
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:21,121
oppressor slash predator and I think 
confusing the hierarchical structure,

1618
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:22,863
especially when it's based on competence
and western structures of hierarchy are 

1619
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:30,760
based in large part,
although not entirely on competence.

1620
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,833
Confusing that with a Predator infant or
oppressor oppression relationship is a 

1621
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:40,180
very bad idea.
Now,

1622
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,980
having said that,
it's obvious that every social structure

1623
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:48,160
has a tyrannical element,
like nobody in their right mind is going

1624
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:49,300
to say,
well,

1625
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,313
our cultural structures are a hundred 
percent fair and just obviously they're 

1626
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:55,834
not in every single person in this room 
and some far more than others have been 

1627
01:32:59,651 --> 01:33:04,060
brutalized by the social structure,
which takes you around the neck,

1628
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:08,830
shakes the hell out of you and says you 
better be like everyone else or else.

1629
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:09,903
Right?
That's the tyrannical aspect of the 

1630
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:11,764
social structure.
So you have to be naive not to think 

1631
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:17,110
that there's some old pressure 
oppressor,

1632
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,840
oppression dynamic in a social 
structure,

1633
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,913
but to make that the only,
the only element of the discussion is 

1634
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:25,870
extraordinarily dangerous.
I mean,

1635
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,393
one of the things that looking at 
terrible things has done for me is make 

1636
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:32,950
me a very grateful person.

1637
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,473
Like when I walk out on the street and I
see that people aren't at each other's 

1638
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:40,240
throats.
I really think that that's a miracle.

1639
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:42,910
Like I was just in Manhattan for a week.
You know,

1640
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,330
if your eyes are open,
that place is an absolute miracle.

1641
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,240
I mean,
there's way too many people there.

1642
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,770
7 million people come in to date,
right?

1643
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:51,683
It's,
it's,

1644
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,533
there's way too many people.
They're just stacked on top of each 

1645
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:55,714
other.
These all these massive skyscrapers and 

1646
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:59,000
they all stand up there.
They all,

1647
01:33:59,001 --> 01:34:01,690
all standing up,
all the traffic lights work,

1648
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:02,583
all the electricity works.
The buildings aren't blowing up one 

1649
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:06,790
after another because of natural gas 
leaks.

1650
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:07,803
They just don't blow up and people 
aren't like beating each other to death 

1651
01:34:10,931 --> 01:34:12,890
with clubs in the street.
It's like,

1652
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,980
so when I go outside in New York,
I think,

1653
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,260
my God,
how did we manage this?

1654
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,230
Because I'm a hub.
See,

1655
01:34:19,231 --> 01:34:20,800
and by nature,
you know,

1656
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:21,903
I think,
and it's not like I'm entirely 

1657
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:25,144
pessimistic,
but I think that you're naive if you 

1658
01:34:28,391 --> 01:34:31,900
don't think that the natural state of 
human beings is one of brutality,

1659
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:33,123
all you have to do is look at history 
and you'll be convinced of that very 

1660
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:36,850
rapidly.
And so the fact that,

1661
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,620
look at us,
we can all sit in here.

1662
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:39,723
We don't know who.
We don't know each other and we're 

1663
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:42,394
having a contentious political 
discussion and like nothing terrible is 

1664
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:48,370
happening and if you don't see that as a
miracle,

1665
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,940
then you're way to protect for your own 
good.

1666
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:53,643
So well.
So back to the back to the 

1667
01:34:56,561 --> 01:35:01,220
agreeableness.
There are tyrannies of care.

1668
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:05,220
The psychoanalysts said the good mother 
fails.

1669
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:09,700
And what that means is that when your 
kid is three years old,

1670
01:35:09,701 --> 01:35:12,430
two years old and stumbling around 
making mistakes,

1671
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,353
you back the hell off and you let them 
make mistakes and you don't view the 

1672
01:35:17,621 --> 01:35:18,454
world as the infant in Predator and you 
don't project that onto the political 

1673
01:35:20,891 --> 01:35:25,320
system because it's not a good idea.
Especially if those who,

1674
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,200
especially for those who you 
misdiagnosis as predators.

1675
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:30,363
Okay,
so now we're going to open it up for q 

1676
01:35:31,961 --> 01:35:33,180
and a.
all right?

1677
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:33,820
Uh,
so the,

1678
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,030
the idea that I've put thought into this
as perhaps a optimistic one,

1679
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,103
but as you might imagine,
you've been a topic of conversation on 

1680
01:35:40,781 --> 01:35:42,670
this campus a lot in the past week or 
so.

1681
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,770
Certainly among a lot of us who discuss 
politics.

1682
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:45,604
And one of the things that sort of 
united people who liked and disliked a 

1683
01:35:48,251 --> 01:35:49,084
lot of your ideas is that we appreciate 
your defensive free speech and we 

1684
01:35:51,131 --> 01:35:52,960
appreciate you coming here to talk about
it with us.

1685
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,133
Uh,
but one of the things I thought was 

1686
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:55,354
really interesting is professor van 
Vandyke addressed the distinction 

1687
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:57,994
between you and Jonathan Heit and you 
mentioned this as sort of a 

1688
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:01,870
temperamental one.
And I think,

1689
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,640
I'm sure that's true to some extent,
but I,

1690
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:07,780
I noticed you've made a lot of more sort
of substantively inflammatory claims.

1691
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,613
Like in the course of this lecture you 
called the peep the authors of facebook 

1692
01:36:11,681 --> 01:36:14,500
posts demons into totality Tarion's,
uh,

1693
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:15,334
in past events you've called them things
like a neo Marxist Cultural Marxists 

1694
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:20,230
you've called them.
Uh,

1695
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:23,380
I believe a fifth column that is 
committing treason against the west.

1696
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:25,510
And it seems to me this is more than 
temperamental.

1697
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:28,530
This is a substantive difference and 
difference.

1698
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,000
And another thing you've done is that 
unlike height,

1699
01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:34,150
you have a more sort of comprehensive 
political program.

1700
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,820
You've talked a lot in defensive,
traditional hierarchies,

1701
01:36:36,821 --> 01:36:41,140
both gender of class.
So on the lymphatically not race,

1702
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,980
uh,
and so I haven't talked about defensive,

1703
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:46,030
traditional hierarchies in terms of 
gender and class.

1704
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:47,320
That's not true.
Well,

1705
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,840
you've talked about hierarchies in 
society.

1706
01:36:49,841 --> 01:36:51,250
You've talked about that.
That's true.

1707
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:54,610
I haven't done.
I haven't justified them on the basis of

1708
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,180
gender and class.
You,

1709
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:59,050
you whatever talked not okay.

1710
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:02,920
That's an important distinction.
But you defend hierarchies in society in

1711
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:06,640
a way that you talk a lot about the 
predo distribution.

1712
01:37:06,641 --> 01:37:08,590
Yes.
That doesn't mean I defend it.

1713
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,101
Well,
okay.

1714
01:37:09,101 --> 01:37:10,330
You know,
not well.

1715
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:11,620
Okay.
Yes.

1716
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,253
Well,
I mean I think you talked about loving 

1717
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,120
that something exists is not the same as
defending it.

1718
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,480
How in the world people attack it.
Right?

1719
01:37:21,481 --> 01:37:22,314
So you don't.
People attack it apparently attack the 

1720
01:37:24,821 --> 01:37:26,950
hierarchies of society's inherently 
unjust.

1721
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,120
Right?
Well,

1722
01:37:28,121 --> 01:37:29,410
they are,
they're unjust.

1723
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,210
They're also useful.
Okay.

1724
01:37:31,211 --> 01:37:35,740
So you said they're useful some level.
We'll just look at it this way.

1725
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:40,990
You obviously think that it's worthwhile
to stand up and ask a question.

1726
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:43,720
Yes.
So you think that standing up and asking

1727
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:47,290
a question is better than not standing 
up and asking your question?

1728
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:47,861
Yes.
Okay.

1729
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,680
That's a hierarchy of values.
Yes.

1730
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:52,480
Okay.
Without the hierarchy of values,

1731
01:37:52,481 --> 01:37:54,190
you couldn't act,
of course.

1732
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,760
No,
no,

1733
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,593
not course.
It's partly why I'm defending the 

1734
01:37:57,661 --> 01:38:01,200
hierarchy hierarchy hierarchy,
right?

1735
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,243
What's that?
There is a hierarchy in society right 

1736
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:04,500
now.
There's multiple.

1737
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,480
There are multiple hierarchies in 
society.

1738
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,860
Right,
and you say that they are based in you.

1739
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:10,080
You invoke the lobster,
right,

1740
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:14,300
that they are based in in nature.
I said that they were inevitable,

1741
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,450
that they were inevitable.
Some people are good,

1742
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,353
but my point is that this is Jenna.
Do you have a broader point then free 

1743
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:23,064
speech.
This is one of the things you talk 

1744
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:25,044
about.
Yes,

1745
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,573
yes.
Okay.

1746
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,550
Whereas I think there's some other 
activist who focus on more exclusive,

1747
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:30,384
not an activist.
There's some other individuals who 

1748
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:35,820
engage in public political speech.
Okay.

1749
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:36,783
Yeah.
Who.

1750
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:38,730
Who focus more exclusively on free 
speech.

1751
01:38:38,731 --> 01:38:39,564
Whereas you have other goals in mind,
but one of the things that you're more 

1752
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,050
inflammatory language and it's fair,
it's a subsidy of disagreement,

1753
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:48,300
has done,
I think is it's politicized.

1754
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,640
This free speaks to an extent that 
someone like height hasn't.

1755
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,743
I've noticed that when someone hears the
term free speech now they associate it 

1756
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:57,810
with a specific set of thinkers often is
viewed as on the extreme,

1757
01:38:57,811 --> 01:38:59,250
right,
and I think,

1758
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,503
I think arguably that's the problem of 
all factions in society because free 

1759
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:03,324
speech should be a universal value.
Polls certainly suggests that it's 

1760
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,070
coming under increasing threat from both
sides,

1761
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,143
but I suppose the heart of my question 
in addition to of course these other 

1762
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,293
observations is that do you believe free
speech is your primary end or do you 

1763
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:17,604
believe these other points you're making
are important because I've heard you a 

1764
01:39:19,201 --> 01:39:20,034
bunch of times defend free speech sort 
of contextually like you've complained 

1765
01:39:22,951 --> 01:39:25,140
about some of the laws in Canada that 
you dislike,

1766
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:28,050
that they institutionalized false facts 
into the law,

1767
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,153
but it seems to me that in absolute is 
defensive free speech makes no 

1768
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,000
preferences to true or false.

1769
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,360
The point is that something you are 
being forced to say something.

1770
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:38,790
It wouldn't be as bad as if you were 
forced to say something.

1771
01:39:38,791 --> 01:39:39,624
That is true because the point of free 
speech is that you can say whatever you 

1772
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:43,074
want,
right?

1773
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:43,943
No,
the point of free speech is so that you 

1774
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:45,894
can think your way through life without 
running toll position a versus perfect 

1775
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:53,180
position b is just as bad.
Right?

1776
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:54,720
Even if one is true and the other is 
not.

1777
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:57,600
Okay.
Well there was a bunch of questions.

1778
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,130
Yes,
good job by the way.

1779
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:02,430
We'll actually wait.
Can I just ask one additional agenda

1780
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,093
which is
I think the politicization of free 

1781
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:12,810
speech is by far the biggest threat to 
free speech because this has always been

1782
01:40:12,811 --> 01:40:14,340
a radical.
Leftists are the biggest

1783
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:16,763
disagreement.
Professor Greely alluded to in previous 

1784
01:40:20,191 --> 01:40:21,540
questions.
The subsidies,

1785
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:24,000
threats to free speech in much of the 
world in Europe.

1786
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:24,893
Certainly I think in the United States 
as well from the government have come 

1787
01:40:27,211 --> 01:40:28,044
from the radical right and I think it's 
fair to say that on the specific narrow 

1788
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,720
subset of certain departments on liberal
arts colleges,

1789
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:37,200
it's fair to say threat comes from the 
left though its scope is in dispute,

1790
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:41,550
but my question is you think that the 
way you talk about free speech,

1791
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:42,413
the way you link it to specific issues,
the way you use inflammatory language 

1792
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:45,953
and the way you seem to make it,
you seem to defend a specific set of 

1793
01:40:48,391 --> 01:40:50,460
free speech.
There's certainly plenty of instances of

1794
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,920
free speech attacked on the other side 
that you don't mention as.

1795
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,413
Do you think you risked politicizing 
this because it seems to me that was 

1796
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:59,860
okay and not think that's a far greater 
threat because for example,

1797
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:02,870
the NRA,
the NRA is a group in the United States,

1798
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:04,110
the defense guns rights.
Right.

1799
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,160
Hold it.
Yes.

1800
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,300
We need a question.

1801
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:08,223
Yes.
Okay.

1802
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,940
Like I said,
you're doing fine.

1803
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,040
It's just too much.
Like I can't keep.

1804
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:12,953
I think that your behavior risk 
politicizing it and do you think that 

1805
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:18,070
polarization is justified?

1806
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:18,980
Okay.

1807
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,440
I think my behavior risks,
politicizing it,

1808
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:25,430
yes,
I would rather it not be politicized and

1809
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,503
I'm doing what I can to manage that risk
however it's become political in my 

1810
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:31,214
country because the government 
implemented compelled speech 

1811
01:41:34,131 --> 01:41:34,964
legislation,
so I wasn't complaining about that 

1812
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,680
before.
It became political now and there are,

1813
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,633
there is a time,
even when you're detached in some sense 

1814
01:41:47,031 --> 01:41:50,060
from the political realm that you can't 
be detached anymore.

1815
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,583
Well,
I'm not happy with the fact that this 

1816
01:41:53,181 --> 01:41:54,014
has become politicized.
You could say that I haven't done a 

1817
01:41:56,871 --> 01:41:57,704
stellar job in ensuring in every 
possible manner that this is remained 

1818
01:42:01,101 --> 01:42:04,040
neutrally a political,
probably true,

1819
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:05,583
you know,
but I'm not particularly unhappy with 

1820
01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:11,180
the way things have gone so far.
So.

1821
01:42:11,181 --> 01:42:12,014
And I'm not happy with the radical left.
And so if they're irritated at me so 

1822
01:42:16,251 --> 01:42:18,200
much,
the better as far as I'm concerned.

1823
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,920
So have I conducted myself perfectly,
it's like a undoubtedly know.

1824
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:27,050
So I'm,
I'm,

1825
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:31,880
I've got more than my fair share of 
faults and a temper is one of them.

1826
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:33,373
But,
um,

1827
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:36,770
I'm muddling through.

1828
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:38,753
Hm,

1829
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,533
alright.
I'm almost hesitant to ask you a 

1830
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:43,490
question now.
Uh,

1831
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,473
but,
um,

1832
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:46,740
so,
uh,

1833
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:48,523
one thing I was wondering about was a 
lot of people I think would argue that 

1834
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,680
I'm kind of the values of Western 
civilization,

1835
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:56,270
uh,
free speech,

1836
01:42:56,271 --> 01:42:57,104
the right of the individual,
a separation between church and state 

1837
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:01,103
have developed through not so much a in 
continuous with the Judeo Christian 

1838
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,114
morality,
but almost in their overthrow through 

1839
01:43:09,831 --> 01:43:10,664
such things as the enlightenment,
the scientific revolution and how these 

1840
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:16,190
values,
uh,

1841
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,230
would never have come out of just 
simply,

1842
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:19,743
uh,
the,

1843
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,990
the continuous of the Middle Ages and 
that you did Christian morality.

1844
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:29,260
But my understanding of your view would 
be that those values are inherent in the

1845
01:43:30,351 --> 01:43:33,950
Judeo Christian morality.
And I'm just wondering how you think,

1846
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,600
uh,
yeah,

1847
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:38,460
just what is the value of Jacobs from 
around in my own world?

1848
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,250
Yeah,
it's a great question.

1849
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:45,750
Um,
they're not rational values.

1850
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,960
There are deeper than values.

1851
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,013
I mean,
it was a surprise to me going back into 

1852
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:56,540
the past,
let's say,

1853
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:01,430
to see how deep these values were.
But I would say that

1854
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,800
not only are they part of the Judeo 
Christian story,

1855
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:07,634
let's say,
but that they're grounded in phenomena 

1856
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:11,414
that are even deeper than that.
Now there's been a fair bit of 

1857
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:17,100
investigation into the emergence of 
fairplay,

1858
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:21,230
let's say among animals rats or 
primates,

1859
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,093
wolves and so forth.
There's an ethos that emerges 

1860
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,083
behaviorally and is then perhaps woven 
into narrative and then codify that 

1861
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:34,280
seems to be
isomorphic across these different levels

1862
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:35,563
and I think it's been well articulated 
in the narrative sense in the Judeo 

1863
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,960
Christian Corpus of stories and that 
it's out of that,

1864
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:46,220
that our legal systems and institutions 
of rights have emerged.

1865
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,593
People make the case that that was 
fundamentally and enlightenment issue 

1866
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:50,924
and it was certainly the case that the 
rational clarity that came along with 

1867
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:56,384
the enlightenment increased the degree 
to which that was articulated and 

1868
01:44:59,511 --> 01:45:00,770
transformed into law.

1869
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,940
But I think to attribute it to that is a
great mistake.

1870
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:06,103
I think it's.
I think the timespan view is way too 

1871
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:12,230
narrow.
That's 500 years ago.

1872
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:16,400
I'm a biologically minded guy.
It's like 500 years.

1873
01:45:16,401 --> 01:45:19,610
That's nothing.
Five thousand years.

1874
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,193
Well,
that's starting to register 50,000 

1875
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:23,654
years.
It's worthy of note 6 million years now 

1876
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:28,004
you're getting somewhere.
There's the ethic that we're discussing 

1877
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:35,681
is way deeper than something conjured up
in like 1500 by some northern Italians.

1878
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:43,640
So it's an articulation of a 
substructure that's much deeper than the

1879
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:46,640
articulation itself.
That's what it looks like to me now.

1880
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:49,640
I think there's room for intelligent 
debate about that,

1881
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:55,240
but I've looked at the enlightenment 
thinkers and at the deeper at,

1882
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:59,240
at people who I regard as deeper and I 
think the deeper guys,

1883
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:00,074
Nietzsche,
Dostoevsky young in particular social 

1884
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,430
units to some degree they've got it 
right.

1885
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:06,343
So I don't think it's,
I don't think that our rights are an 

1886
01:46:08,721 --> 01:46:09,554
enlightenment project there 
instantiation into codified law that's 

1887
01:46:14,271 --> 01:46:16,940
more part and parcel of the 
enlightenment that,

1888
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:20,030
that would be particularly manifest in a
place like the United States,

1889
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:21,890
you know?
So

1890
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,350
yeah.
If I can just ask a related question is,

1891
01:46:25,351 --> 01:46:29,160
you mentioned each a and uh,
because from what I understand,

1892
01:46:29,161 --> 01:46:30,750
if you're working,
you just seem to draw from him a lot.

1893
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:32,130
And again,
you said you agree with him.

1894
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:33,310
So I just,

1895
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:35,680
you know what he thinks a lot of things.

1896
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:36,643
Yeah.
So I guess I'm wondering where you 

1897
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:39,884
think,
because I'm imagining you imagine he 

1898
01:46:41,421 --> 01:46:42,254
went wrong in his interpretation of the 
Christian morality and how he believes 

1899
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:50,610
and how he believes that's kind of a 
pernicious

1900
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,350
soy based morality.
So what do you,

1901
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,243
what exactly do you think?
Because you agree with a lot of other 

1902
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:57,660
things,
Christian morality,

1903
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:58,494
he created critique Christian Dogma and 
and structures that's not exactly the 

1904
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:05,070
same thing.
So you would agree with him then?

1905
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:05,881
Alright,
well,

1906
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:07,770
like I said,
he's a complicated guy,

1907
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:13,160
but I think the slave morality idea,
the idea that the oppressed or somehow a

1908
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,143
virtuous,
which I don't think is a central 

1909
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:18,384
Christian idea by the way.
It was something that he criticized as 

1910
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:23,920
part and parcel of what was constructed 
and,

1911
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,880
and,
and concretized in,

1912
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,890
in an institutional Christianity and 
neat.

1913
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:31,350
You also,
and this is a deeper critique,

1914
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:35,100
I think nature really criticized 
institutional Christianity,

1915
01:47:35,101 --> 01:47:37,900
particularly the Protestant and Catholic
form.

1916
01:47:37,901 --> 01:47:38,734
So I would say for insufficient 
attention paid to the imitation of 

1917
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:46,410
Christ and too much attention paid to 
the idea that the work of redemption had

1918
01:47:46,411 --> 01:47:50,520
already been done,
which is something that also divides the

1919
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,353
Orthodox Christian types from the 
Protestants and the Catholics because 

1920
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:53,754
the orthodox types tend to tilt more 
towards the moral demand that you 

1921
01:47:57,391 --> 01:48:01,140
imitate Christ in your own life.
And so Nietzsche is a very.

1922
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,153
You can't sum up very easily and I found
him extraordinarily useful in training 

1923
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:10,950
me how to think,
to say,

1924
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:11,873
to say that you agree with him,
I don't think that you can say with 

1925
01:48:14,581 --> 01:48:18,680
someone like nature that you agree with 
him because you know nature had.

1926
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:19,703
This is one thing that needs said that I
really got a kick out of because it was 

1927
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,274
the.
It's the most most arrogant statement 

1928
01:48:25,681 --> 01:48:28,710
I've ever heard anyone make.
He said,

1929
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:33,790
I can write in a sentence what it takes 
other people,

1930
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:36,280
a book to relate.

1931
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:38,573
And then he said,
now what other people can't even relate 

1932
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,990
in a book.
And that's exactly right.

1933
01:48:42,991 --> 01:48:45,180
Like if you read beyond good and evil,
for example,

1934
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:49,410
which is mostly aphorisms.
So because he was a very sick man and he

1935
01:48:49,411 --> 01:48:50,244
couldn't write for long periods of time,
so he would think for long periods of 

1936
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:56,190
time and then write down a little bomb 
and beyond,

1937
01:48:56,191 --> 01:48:57,024
good and evil is just sequential pieces 
of dynamite and he wasn't trying to be 

1938
01:49:03,061 --> 01:49:03,894
systematic precisely and so that's why 
it's not so easy to agree or disagree 

1939
01:49:07,471 --> 01:49:10,770
with nature,
but you can sure let the bombs go off in

1940
01:49:10,771 --> 01:49:13,830
your brain if you read what he has to 
say and he.

1941
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:15,623
He was an interesting critic of 
Christianity because you know if you're 

1942
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:20,423
all warped and bent and someone comes 
along and tells you how your warped in 

1943
01:49:23,661 --> 01:49:26,130
bent in a manner that might enable you 
to straighten up,

1944
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,560
it's not obvious that they're.
That you're their enemy,

1945
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,823
that they,
they're your enemy and I think that's 

1946
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:35,480
the right way to read nature with 
regards to Christianity.

1947
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:41,680
So he there was plenty of wrought and 
that was part of what was causing,

1948
01:49:43,071 --> 01:49:44,600
let's say,
the death of God.

1949
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:46,303
Now it obvious at all that nature was 
antithetically opposed to the founding 

1950
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:54,790
ideas.
In fact,

1951
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:58,120
there's many places where he writes that
indicate quite the contrary,

1952
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,703
so

1953
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,673
thank you.

1954
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:03,743
Okay,
so we're going to go to Alex and then 

1955
01:50:04,981 --> 01:50:05,814
say it.

1956
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:07,960
It's going to distribute the microphone.

1957
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,900
Thank you for being here.
I really appreciate it.

1958
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:19,813
Um,
so I was watching a few of your 

1959
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,073
interviews in preparation for this and I
heard you speak about religion quite a 

1960
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:30,000
bit and if you look up what religion 
means in the webster dictionary,

1961
01:50:30,001 --> 01:50:30,834
you get something like a system of faith
centered on a supernatural being or 

1962
01:50:35,761 --> 01:50:36,594
beings or something like that.
But I've heard you use religion to 

1963
01:50:38,761 --> 01:50:40,890
describe things like punk rockers,
for example.

1964
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,760
That's a religious experience.
So my first question would be how do you

1965
01:50:44,761 --> 01:50:49,320
define what is considered religious?
And then sort of as a followup to that,

1966
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:52,300
if say Sam Harris,

1967
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,630
act out,
what's that?

1968
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:59,850
Religious is what you act out.
Anything you act out,

1969
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:05,640
everything you act out is,
is predicated on your implicit axioms.

1970
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:06,683
And the system of implicit axioms that 
you hold as primary is your religious 

1971
01:51:10,201 --> 01:51:11,034
belief system.
It doesn't matter whether you're an 

1972
01:51:12,481 --> 01:51:15,570
atheist or not,
that's just surface,

1973
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,420
that's just surface noise.

1974
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:19,973
So it has nothing to do with divinity or
natural or it doesn't necessarily have 

1975
01:51:25,141 --> 01:51:25,974
to do with those.

1976
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,263
No,
it probably necessarily has to do with 

1977
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:32,020
it too,
but it doesn't necessarily have anything

1978
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:32,854
to do with your voluntarily articulated 
statements about whether or not you 

1979
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:39,400
believe in something like a transcendent
deity.

1980
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,103
So mean.
What you act out is much more what you 

1981
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:46,570
are then,
what you say about yourself and what the

1982
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:48,760
hell do you know about what you believe 
anyways,

1983
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,100
you're complicated math.
Their question.

1984
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:53,290
Well seriously,
people are complicated.

1985
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,790
You know,
like we're,

1986
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:55,683
we don't,
we're not transparent to ourselves at 

1987
01:51:56,771 --> 01:51:58,210
all.
That's why we,

1988
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:00,850
that's why we have to go to university 
and study psychology.

1989
01:52:00,851 --> 01:52:01,810
It's like,
you know,

1990
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:02,500
we're,
we're,

1991
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,333
we're not exactly black boxes,
but we are the most complicated things 

1992
01:52:06,851 --> 01:52:08,590
there are.
Right.

1993
01:52:08,591 --> 01:52:11,410
And we can't even program our VCR 
clocks.

1994
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:16,650
So it's like how the hell can we propose
to understand ourselves and you know I'm

1995
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,513
existentially oriented,
which is to say that I think that what 

1996
01:52:22,091 --> 01:52:27,091
you hold to be true is best determined 
as an as a consequence of an analysis of

1997
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:28,384
your actions rather than as a 
consequence of an analysis of what you 

1998
01:52:32,261 --> 01:52:33,610
purport to believe.

1999
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,673
Now in order to act,
you can't act without a hierarchy of 

2000
01:52:39,161 --> 01:52:39,994
value,
which I tortured the other poor 

2001
01:52:40,941 --> 01:52:41,774
questionnaire about.
You can't act without a hierarchy of 

2002
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:44,944
values because you can't act unless you 
think one thing is better than another 

2003
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,450
because why?
Why would you act otherwise?

2004
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:53,840
So that means that you're embedded 
within a hierarchy of values,

2005
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,063
whether you know it or not,
or maybe multiple fragmentary and 

2006
01:52:56,961 --> 01:52:57,794
competing hierarchies of value,
which is all the worst for you by the 

2007
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:02,360
way,
because it just makes you very confused.

2008
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:06,230
That hierarchy of values has an 
axiomatic.

2009
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,553
It's based on axioms and the probability
that you understand them is very low 

2010
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:14,180
because generally people don't 
understand their axioms,

2011
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:19,160
but that axiomatic system is essentially
your religious system and there's.

2012
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,560
There's no way out of that.
As far as I can tell,

2013
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,640
and you can say,
well,

2014
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:27,641
it isn't predicated on conscious belief 
in a transcendent deity.

2015
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:28,503
It's like,
okay,

2016
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:31,190
have it your way,
but you know,

2017
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:37,240
most people in this room act out a Judeo
Christian ethic and not only do they act

2018
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:43,040
it out if they're treated in a manner 
that's not commensurate with that ethic,

2019
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,540
they get very,
very,

2020
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:47,270
very annoyed.
So for example,

2021
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:52,271
if I failed to treat you as if you're an
embodiment of a divine fragment,

2022
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:54,254
let's say that's characterized by the 
ability to the ability to make free 

2023
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:01,880
choice and to determine your own destiny
in some sense,

2024
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:05,990
or if I fail to treat you as if you're a
valued member,

2025
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:06,853
valued,
contributing member of the polity as a 

2026
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:12,740
sovereign individual,
then you'll find that very offensive and

2027
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:14,060
become angry.
It's like,

2028
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:17,000
okay,
then that's what you believe.

2029
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,250
Well,
if I ask you,

2030
01:54:19,251 --> 01:54:21,770
if you believe any of that,
well that's a whole different story.

2031
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:24,500
You might give me some radical leftist 
nonsense,

2032
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,650
but that doesn't translate from what 
you've.

2033
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:31,370
That doesn't take away from the 
fundamentals of your auction

2034
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:34,513
as one final thing.
So when you say Sam Harris argue about 

2035
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:38,563
religion,
you're arguing about fundamentally 

2036
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:43,130
different things.
It sounds like his conception of what is

2037
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:45,710
religious is very different from yours.
Yeah.

2038
01:54:45,711 --> 01:54:46,544
Well he tends to think of religious 
religious thought the same way that a 

2039
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:55,160
smart 13 year old atheist thinks about a
fundamentalist Christian.

2040
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,961
It's like,
yeah,

2041
01:54:56,961 --> 01:54:59,240
okay.
That just,

2042
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:01,400
you're just not getting to the heart of 
the matter.

2043
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:04,030
You know,
and I just finished reading all of Sam's

2044
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:07,760
books in the last couple of weeks and as
far as I'm concerned,

2045
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:11,120
he doesn't ever get to the bottom of the
issue.

2046
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:13,340
It doesn't address the fundamental 
thinkers.

2047
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:18,430
There are some profound thinkers,
Dostoevsky's one toll story Nicha young.

2048
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:21,650
It's like they're completely absent 
from.

2049
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:23,990
And the same with Dawkins,
completely absent.

2050
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:27,290
All that conceptualization is completely
absent from their Corpus of works.

2051
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:28,753
They don't even have an understanding 
for the psychological utility of 

2052
01:55:30,921 --> 01:55:33,470
religion.
And it's a big problem.

2053
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,200
You know,
you,

2054
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,660
you don't get to be an atheist when the 
people you attack or fundamental like,

2055
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:39,723
like naive fundamentalists.
And I have some sympathy for the naive 

2056
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:44,300
fundamentalists,

2057
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,950
just like what they're basically saying 
is something like this,

2058
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:49,650
look,
we have an ethos that's valuable.

2059
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:54,570
You scientists types are casually 
dismantling it.

2060
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:57,680
What the hell are we supposed to do?
What?

2061
01:55:57,681 --> 01:55:59,460
The fundamentalists don't know what to 
do about that.

2062
01:55:59,461 --> 01:56:00,091
So they say,
well,

2063
01:56:00,091 --> 01:56:02,100
creationism is science.
It's like,

2064
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:02,934
well no it's not.
But that doesn't mean that they don't 

2065
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:07,350
have a point there.
Point,

2066
01:56:07,351 --> 01:56:09,270
is there something valuable here?
It's like,

2067
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:12,000
don't break it casually.
What are you gonna?

2068
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:12,843
Replace it with the new atheists.
Swiss wish that everybody becomes 

2069
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:17,910
rational.
It's like,

2070
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:19,420
yeah,
sure that's going to happen.

2071
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,473
Thank you.

2072
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,960
Thank you Dr Peterson.
I'm A.

2073
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:26,793
I'm a student of the religious studies 
and and currently I'm writing an honors 

2074
01:56:29,261 --> 01:56:33,850
thesis on religious imagery in an 
Indonesian literary genre.

2075
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:36,370
There's a poet,
philosopher who said the following,

2076
01:56:36,371 --> 01:56:39,280
which I think you like,
who by the way was a huge fan of goiter.

2077
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,740
Hey,
you said that in addressing God,

2078
01:56:41,770 --> 01:56:42,603
he says he calls him the hidden reality 
and he asks that hidden reality to 

2079
01:56:45,971 --> 01:56:46,804
reveal itself,
but using the robe of metro for because 

2080
01:56:49,091 --> 01:56:49,924
he thinks that metaphor is the only way.
I think stories are the only way that 

2081
01:56:53,531 --> 01:56:55,700
human beings can comprehend,
you know,

2082
01:56:55,701 --> 01:56:56,680
the,
the hidden reality.

2083
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:59,740
I know you've written a lot of you,
you speak a lot about,

2084
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:01,570
uh,
about real stories.

2085
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:02,404
I just wanted to ask you,
although it may be a very broad 

2086
01:57:04,511 --> 01:57:05,344
question,
what is the place of the religious in 

2087
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:10,320
stories and uh,

2088
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,473
you're religious is something like the 
grammatical structure of stories I give 

2089
01:57:15,181 --> 01:57:20,181
you go down and you look at what makes a
story a story that's religious.

2090
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:21,983
Yeah.
It's not a story otherwise like a story 

2091
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:27,030
as a particular sort of thing.
Like in its simplest sense,

2092
01:57:27,031 --> 01:57:30,510
the story is an account of how to get 
from point a to point b.

2093
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:32,813
it's like a map,
but there's a value structure inherent 

2094
01:57:35,881 --> 01:57:39,150
in that obviously because otherwise you 
wouldn't go from point a to point b.

2095
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:42,210
So just to make the map means to adopt a
value structure.

2096
01:57:42,211 --> 01:57:43,044
But there,
but the story is actually more 

2097
01:57:43,651 --> 01:57:47,100
complicated than that because as you 
move from point a to point b,

2098
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:48,293
processes of radical transformation are 
often necessary and the deep stories 

2099
01:57:54,031 --> 01:57:54,864
about the processes of radical 
transformation that occur as you move 

2100
01:57:57,811 --> 01:57:58,644
from point a to b are basically they're 
indistinguishable from religious 

2101
01:58:02,491 --> 01:58:03,324
stories.

2102
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:07,710
Now the reason they I think the reason 
they they tend to become religious,

2103
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:08,544
let's say,
is because it has something to do with 

2104
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:10,944
the gap between the finite and 
comprehensible and the infinite and 

2105
01:58:14,281 --> 01:58:15,114
uncomprehensible.
It's like we live in the finite and 

2106
01:58:17,131 --> 01:58:19,710
comprehensible,
but we're surrounded by the infinite and

2107
01:58:19,711 --> 01:58:22,770
incomprehensible and there has to be a 
border between those.

2108
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:26,190
Have some like a mediating border.
That's poetry and art.

2109
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:29,580
That's narrative,
that's religion and it's that.

2110
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:30,563
It's that strange metaphorical reality.
Let's say that's not factual and it's 

2111
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:36,204
not comprehensible,
but that's not infinitely 

2112
01:58:38,161 --> 01:58:40,860
incomprehensible either.
It's a bridge between the two.

2113
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:42,383
So and as you move closer to the 
infinite and incomprehensible across 

2114
01:58:47,111 --> 01:58:47,944
that bridge,
you get farther and farther away from 

2115
01:58:50,261 --> 01:58:51,610
what you understand,
right?

2116
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:54,760
But how could it be otherwise given that
your finite,

2117
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:59,110
you are a finite being surrounded by 
infinite,

2118
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:01,990
it's infinite in incomprehensible.

2119
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:06,330
And that was his critique of district 
rationalist and they can't do that.

2120
01:59:06,331 --> 01:59:08,930
It's hard for them to,
to make this a two.

2121
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:11,940
That's what poets come in.
And that's exactly.

2122
01:59:11,941 --> 01:59:12,780
Well,
this is what I learned

2123
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:13,693
a lot of this from young because young 
is his idea was that rationality is 

2124
01:59:17,121 --> 01:59:20,890
embedded in a dream,
like there's the infinite unknowable.

2125
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:21,733
And then there's the dream.
And then inside the dream is the 

2126
01:59:24,381 --> 01:59:25,920
rational domain.
And I,

2127
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,360
I believe that to be the case.
Why else would we dream?

2128
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:33,170
We have to dream.
If we don't dream,

2129
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:36,200
we would go insane.
It doesn't take very long.

2130
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:39,830
And so there's,
there's an element of poetic

2131
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:46,730
conceptualization that grounds us and it
has to be taken seriously.

2132
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,033
You know,
the,

2133
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:52,650
the rational critics of dreams think 
about them as random neuroactivity.

2134
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:53,773
It's like there's nothing wrong.
When you look at a TV screen that's not 

2135
01:59:57,981 --> 01:59:58,814
on a channel that's random.
When you dream something complex and 

2136
02:00:03,441 --> 02:00:06,140
sophisticated,
that's not random.

2137
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:12,140
So yeah,
so the metaphor surrounds us,

2138
02:00:12,141 --> 02:00:14,630
let's say,
and we can critique it rationally and we

2139
02:00:14,631 --> 02:00:16,760
can undermine it,
but there's real danger in that.

2140
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,090
So.
Sure.

2141
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:29,780
Take one question from here,
then take one on the other end.

2142
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:36,990
We have a right side of the loom bias.
Hi Professor.

2143
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:40,933
Yeah,
thanks you for a dark and I explained 

2144
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,540
out to from you,
um,

2145
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:44,773
what's your view of institutional racism
visit a thing or is it some other lefty 

2146
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:53,310
radical leftist agenda?
Say,

2147
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:54,223
I didn't quite get to the first.
What was your view of institutional 

2148
02:00:57,141 --> 02:00:57,974
racism?
More systematic racism as some people 

2149
02:00:59,451 --> 02:01:02,170
may call it a system.
Yeah,

2150
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:02,740
yeah,
yes,

2151
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:04,790
yes.
Is it a,

2152
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:06,770
is it a thing?
It's an actual thing

2153
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:13,420
that his mother had agenda that you 
might attribute to radical leftists.

2154
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:17,350
It's a multivariate problem,
right?

2155
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:18,263
Like no society is without its biases 
and prejudices and some of them get 

2156
02:01:22,781 --> 02:01:27,781
built into the systems themselves.
And so when you look at unequal outcomes

2157
02:01:28,301 --> 02:01:31,480
and you're trying to discover why those 
unequal outcomes exist,

2158
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,583
if you have any sense,
then you do a multivariate analysis and 

2159
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:38,860
you put in prejudice and discrimination 
as one of the factors,

2160
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:40,070
one of

2161
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,440
the factors,
one of many,

2162
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:43,363
many factors and what the problem with 
the radical leftist is that they take 

2163
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:52,250
the fact that societal structures are 
tyrannical to some degree and arbitrary,

2164
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,143
which of course they are because they're
imperfect and then they obliterate the 

2165
02:01:57,171 --> 02:01:58,004
rest of the complexity with that claim.
So there's lots of reasons for 

2166
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:05,350
inequality,
systemic biases,

2167
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:07,070
one of the two,
what did.

2168
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:11,600
It's an open question to what degree 
systemic bias plays in,

2169
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:14,780
in the inequality problem,
let's say,

2170
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,153
but it's something that we could 
hypothetically address with a certain 

2171
02:02:18,861 --> 02:02:23,861
degree of detachment and intelligence.
So no system is perfect,

2172
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:27,350
not and certainly not all

2173
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:33,130
reasonable reasonable answer.

2174
02:02:35,370 --> 02:02:39,900
That stuff's yes.
All right.

2175
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,793
So I think it's safe to say you're a 
fervent of postmodernism and there are 

2176
02:02:45,931 --> 02:02:50,910
times where I don't think you quite give
it a fair shake and I'm no fan of,

2177
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,253
you know,
a good amount of the literature or the 

2178
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:53,664
theory,
but if you could point to one or two of 

2179
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:59,220
the French theorists and some of their 
pieces,

2180
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:00,870
what are,
whether it's their literature,

2181
02:03:00,871 --> 02:03:02,460
their theory,
um,

2182
02:03:02,850 --> 02:03:03,683
or you could point to that's called for 
this sort of cultural rot that you 

2183
02:03:05,761 --> 02:03:08,700
charge postmodernism with causing,
who would it be,

2184
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:09,563
what would it be?

2185
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:12,530
I would say for Colon,

2186
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:16,720
well,
if I could understand it,

2187
02:03:16,721 --> 02:03:18,620
but I think he is understanding

2188
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:21,170
so I can't blame him.
So,

2189
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:22,613
um,
and I've done my best to read and I 

2190
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:27,410
think the reason I can't read it is 
because it doesn't make any sense.

2191
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:31,370
So because I've read some very difficult
things and I could understand them.

2192
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:33,140
So,
um,

2193
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:34,383
for coal I think is a tin part genius.
I read Madison's civilization for 

2194
02:03:37,881 --> 02:03:39,860
example.
It just seems to me to be self evident.

2195
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:44,120
Psychiatric diagnostic categories are in
part social constructions.

2196
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:46,970
It's like great.
We've known that since late 1960,

2197
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,133
you know,
it's just not that big a revelation and 

2198
02:03:50,661 --> 02:03:51,471
Dera Dot,
well,

2199
02:03:51,471 --> 02:03:52,660
he's a trickster,
you know,

2200
02:03:52,661 --> 02:03:56,690
in his critique of the West as logo 
centric is dead on point.

2201
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:00,860
Male dominated.
That's his theory and logo centric.

2202
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:03,860
While he thinks that's a problem.
Well I don't think it's a problem.

2203
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,420
So,
and I think as well it isn't even that,

2204
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:10,640
and I understand the postmodernist 
viewpoint,

2205
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,503
like look,
it is the case that a finite set of 

2206
02:04:14,391 --> 02:04:17,300
entities is subject to an infinite 
number of interpretations.

2207
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:19,610
Okay.
That's postmodernism in a nutshell.

2208
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:24,170
The Ai guys figured that out and like 
from 1960 to 1992,

2209
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:28,010
it took them that long to wade through 
that fundamental technical problem,

2210
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:30,350
a real problem.
The problem of perception,

2211
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:31,184
for example,
it's been very hard to solve the ai 

2212
02:04:32,751 --> 02:04:35,660
problem of perception because there are 
a lot of ways to look at the world.

2213
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,460
Like the objects aren't just there in 
any simple sense.

2214
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:39,421
So,
okay,

2215
02:04:39,421 --> 02:04:41,400
there's an infinite number of 
interpretations.

2216
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:45,420
No problem.
There's not an infinite number of viable

2217
02:04:45,421 --> 02:04:47,070
interpretations.
Okay,

2218
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,120
that's a big problem.
Okay.

2219
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:52,380
And a little bit of thinking through 
that would have gone a long ways for the

2220
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:53,520
postmodernist.
So that's,

2221
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:57,270
that's number one.
And then what's the other one?

2222
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,020
Oh yes they did.
Then the other problem is,

2223
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:04,854
okay,
there's an infinite number of 

2224
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:07,850
interpretations.
We won't make anyone canonical.

2225
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:08,863
All right,
well then how the hell are you going to 

2226
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:11,364
act?
Because you have to make a value system 

2227
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:17,190
canonical if you're going to act.
Oh well we didn't solve that problem.

2228
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,083
How about we just slipped Marxism and 
underneath the carpet and not noticed 

2229
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:23,910
the problem.
Then that gives us something to do.

2230
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:26,910
Like people come out and criticize me 
and say,

2231
02:05:26,911 --> 02:05:27,744
Dr Peterson doesn't understand that 
postmodernism and Marxism are 

2232
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:31,470
incommensurate.
It's like,

2233
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:34,290
yeah,
actually I do understand that.

2234
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:38,190
But the postmodern neo Marxists don't 
seem to understand that.

2235
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:42,600
So how can you be a postmodernist marks 
Marxist at the same time?

2236
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:44,003
Well,
the answer to that is actually to be 

2237
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:45,564
found in the historical data.
The postmodernist types like Fuco and 

2238
02:05:48,331 --> 02:05:52,530
Derrida were Marxists before they became
postmodernists.

2239
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:55,710
And the postmodern overlay on the 
Marxism was,

2240
02:05:55,711 --> 02:05:58,530
as far as I can tell,
mostly a cover story for going about the

2241
02:05:58,531 --> 02:06:01,830
same old murderous idiocy under a new 
guys.

2242
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,650
So

2243
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:08,650
you think it's possible that there are.
I'm sorry that there are lenses.

2244
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:10,323
I'm like postmodern lenses that we can 
view culture from under that can at 

2245
02:06:16,161 --> 02:06:20,720
times be more powerful and useful than 
than other lenses.

2246
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:23,710
Like for example,
the idea of the simulator.

2247
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,210
Tremendous success of phases of the 
image.

2248
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:27,230
I'm Joan Didion.

2249
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:28,603
You could at least think,
and I mean you can't throw all the 

2250
02:06:31,401 --> 02:06:34,490
postmodernists into the same jug,
you know,

2251
02:06:34,491 --> 02:06:35,324
but I would say it's still daredevils 
who cove had the most pernicious 

2252
02:06:38,031 --> 02:06:39,170
effects.
Okay.

2253
02:06:39,171 --> 02:06:43,950
So you would charge
well the.

2254
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:48,900
Well the problem is they didn't deal 
with it seriously.

2255
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:51,940
It's like you can't just say no Meta 
narrative.

2256
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:52,621
It's like,
okay,

2257
02:06:52,621 --> 02:06:53,940
how are we going to unite ourselves 
there?

2258
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:55,520
Okay,

2259
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,250
we're going to use multiculturalism.
Oh,

2260
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,270
that's really worked to produce a 
peaceful world,

2261
02:06:59,271 --> 02:07:03,140
hasn't it?
So you need a uniting narrative.

2262
02:07:03,141 --> 02:07:04,330
We have.
If we weren't,

2263
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:07,220
didn't have a uniting narrative,
we wouldn't all be sitting peacefully in

2264
02:07:07,221 --> 02:07:08,054
this room.
It's the uniting narrative that governs 

2265
02:07:09,891 --> 02:07:13,280
our behavior in this room and look,
here we are all peaceful.

2266
02:07:13,490 --> 02:07:14,323
It's like they're not dealing with the 
fundamental issues and to slip Marxism 

2267
02:07:17,031 --> 02:07:17,864
back in as a backdoor route to having 
something to do with your life is 

2268
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,153
intellectually,
intellectually and morally 

2269
02:07:24,321 --> 02:07:25,154
reprehensible.

2270
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:26,970
Okay.
Thank you.

2271
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,900
Yep.
C,

2272
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:32,153
take one.

2273
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:38,170
How are you sir?
My name is Steve.

2274
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:41,650
I just wanted to ask you about this 
experience that I had after watching one

2275
02:07:41,651 --> 02:07:44,940
of your lectures that really profoundly 
impacted me and I was,

2276
02:07:44,941 --> 02:07:45,774
I was wondering if you could kind of 
help me out with understanding this 

2277
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:51,280
after watching your lecture on young and
just talking about his life.

2278
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:52,493
Uh,
you started talking about the lion king 

2279
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:58,130
and kind of connecting with the intro 
scene was in the lion king and,

2280
02:07:58,180 --> 02:07:59,830
and the,
the idea of archetypes.

2281
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:02,380
And when I started understanding what 
you were saying,

2282
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:03,543
I had this unbelievable feeling in my 
stomach and my whole body is just his 

2283
02:08:07,531 --> 02:08:11,320
smile like this,
like this very intense feeling.

2284
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:13,480
So warning,
never to read you.

2285
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:15,760
I have,
I started with ion.

2286
02:08:15,761 --> 02:08:17,620
So that's not a good idea.
So

2287
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:22,180
it was just as powerful feeling and I,
I got so emotional,

2288
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:25,810
you know,
and ask thinking about how to articulate

2289
02:08:25,811 --> 02:08:27,070
this question to you a few minutes ago.

2290
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:29,220
I was just getting so emotional.
It was,

2291
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:31,210
it was a,
it just seems like,

2292
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:33,040
you know,
it scared the hell out of me,

2293
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:36,310
that feeling.
But it was also a really meaningful,

2294
02:08:36,311 --> 02:08:39,160
so valuable,
amazing feeling and I thought,

2295
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:40,473
you know,
it's Kinda like what maybe what God is 

2296
02:08:42,641 --> 02:08:43,474
or,
you know.

2297
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,490
Yeah,
it was just so,

2298
02:08:45,491 --> 02:08:49,660
and I usually get that feeling to have 
have after listening to it like a band,

2299
02:08:49,661 --> 02:08:54,210
like the Cro mags of black flag,
arunos hardcore bands like that.

2300
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:56,470
Music is so important to me like that.
And,

2301
02:08:56,850 --> 02:08:57,683
and um,
it's levels of reality that is stacking 

2302
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:03,940
on top of it.
And it just a question that just made me

2303
02:09:03,941 --> 02:09:06,640
so emotional too is like,
what could my life be,

2304
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:08,570
you know?
And that was something that I,

2305
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,420
I just found myself asking myself,
you know,

2306
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:12,010
just what.
And I just,

2307
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:12,844
I wonder if you could give me some,
some extra stuff on that without really 

2308
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:17,140
was,
you know.

2309
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:18,461
Yeah.
Well,

2310
02:09:18,461 --> 02:09:19,294
you've gotTa,
you've gotta be very careful when 

2311
02:09:20,321 --> 02:09:22,480
you're,
when you're doing something like reading

2312
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:23,314
young because he'll reorganize your 
cognitive structures and that's there's 

2313
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:32,530
deaths and rebirths that go along with 
that.

2314
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:36,880
You know there's what you're trying to 
do in part is to,

2315
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:38,583
in a sense,
as you're trying to bring what you do 

2316
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:45,840
and how you imagine yourself and how you
articulate yourself into alignment.

2317
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:47,403
So those three things are the same.
It's very hard because there's more to 

2318
02:09:50,261 --> 02:09:51,094
you in your auction than there is in 
your articulation and there's more to 

2319
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:54,994
you in your auction than there is in 
your imagination and so partly what 

2320
02:09:58,331 --> 02:09:59,164
you're.
What you're experiencing is an expanded 

2321
02:10:02,141 --> 02:10:06,130
sense of self and possibility and you 
might think,

2322
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:07,330
well,
that's a wonderful thing,

2323
02:10:07,331 --> 02:10:11,350
but it's a.
it's also a very daunting thing and it.

2324
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:12,423
It can be a very dangerous thing.
When I was dealing with all of this 

2325
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:18,070
material,
when I was writing my first book,

2326
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:19,413
I had to abandoned a lot of the things 
that I was doing that were bad habits 

2327
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:24,363
because it was so stressful to move 
through these systems of ideas that I 

2328
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:33,160
couldn't afford any additional mental 
energy being wasted.

2329
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:33,980
Things I was

2330
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,200
doing that wasn't,
that weren't together.

2331
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:37,723
So

2332
02:10:42,490 --> 02:10:45,660
you got to a prolonged debate,
uh,

2333
02:10:45,670 --> 02:10:49,520
on twitter with a Bot,
a Bot,

2334
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:52,500
and then again on March.
Yeah,

2335
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:54,740
it was a lot.
So that wasn't very break,

2336
02:10:54,790 --> 02:10:56,370
wasn't no.
Uh,

2337
02:10:56,590 --> 02:10:57,920
and then again on,
uh,

2338
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:00,800
on March ninth actually with Noam 
Chomsky,

2339
02:11:01,110 --> 02:11:03,420
a animatronic people bought.
And so,

2340
02:11:03,421 --> 02:11:05,390
uh,
I want to ask you as like the leading

2341
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:06,703
old,

2342
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:09,803
so,
um,

2343
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:12,113
yeah.
So,

2344
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:13,190
uh,
how,

2345
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,830
how important do you think it is to 
like,

2346
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:17,980
debate these intellectuals and do you 
think that you are,

2347
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,843
you want.

2348
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:21,790
Oh God,
I always hesitate,

2349
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:25,930
hesitate to claim victory.
Like to,

2350
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,350
to escape without abject defeat is a 
pretty good,

2351
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:32,740
pretty good ambition.
So,

2352
02:11:33,230 --> 02:11:34,063
um,
and plus I think it's rather improbable 

2353
02:11:36,731 --> 02:11:38,780
that I would win a debate with a Bot.

2354
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,313
Right?
So some people thought it was pretty 

2355
02:11:40,761 --> 02:11:45,761
close.
Twitter is a weird platform,

2356
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:48,290
you know,
it's,

2357
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:49,430
it's,
it's complicated,

2358
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:50,470
complicated

2359
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,303
platform and I've,
I've modified my approach to twitter in 

2360
02:11:55,391 --> 02:11:56,224
the last month and half I would say.
I've been trying to selectively retweet 

2361
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:04,233
information.
I pulled a bunch of people and asked 

2362
02:12:06,161 --> 02:12:09,130
them if they knew of credible twitter 
sources that we're producing

2363
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:11,523
valid good news.
And I found a bunch of sites that were 

2364
02:12:15,791 --> 02:12:19,480
doing that and then winnow them down.
I really like human progress.org,

2365
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:22,630
which has done a lovely job of 
detailing.

2366
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:23,853
Well they had a,
they had a great tweet the other day I 

2367
02:12:25,361 --> 02:12:26,194
really loved.
It was a mock up of a New York Times 

2368
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:33,000
cover and it said 127,000 people lifted 
out of abject poverty today,

2369
02:12:33,581 --> 02:12:35,470
you know,
in like large type.

2370
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:36,783
And then the tweet was we could have run
this every single day for the last 20 

2371
02:12:40,211 --> 02:12:41,710
years.
It's like,

2372
02:12:42,130 --> 02:12:44,290
you know,
because some of you know,

2373
02:12:44,291 --> 02:12:45,124
but perhaps some of you don't that 
between the year 2000 and 2012 and this 

2374
02:12:49,541 --> 02:12:50,560
hasn't stopped yet.

2375
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:54,970
The number of people in abject poverty 
in the world fell by my half,

2376
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,520
right?
It was the most rapid period of economic

2377
02:12:57,521 --> 02:12:59,410
development ever in the history of the 
world.

2378
02:12:59,411 --> 02:13:01,450
And there's lots of things like that 
happening.

2379
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:04,990
There's several hundred thousand people 
a day being hooked to the power grid,

2380
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,243
which is a big deal for those of you.
Those of you who have power might also 

2381
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:11,060
appreciate that.
Um,

2382
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,990
infant mortality has been plummeting.
You know,

2383
02:13:13,991 --> 02:13:14,824
we're going to plateau in terms of 
population at about $9 billion and it's 

2384
02:13:17,261 --> 02:13:20,110
going to level off and decline pretty 
rapidly after that.

2385
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:25,340
People are getting access to fresh water
in record numbers like there,

2386
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,480
there's so many good things happening 
that it's not even funny and,

2387
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:29,510
uh,
that we,

2388
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:33,600
that are real cause for celebration.
And so I've been trying to select trying

2389
02:13:33,601 --> 02:13:36,330
to tilt what I've been distributed more 
in that direction.

2390
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:39,660
And I've also put a buffer between me 
and my use of twitter.

2391
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:41,690
So,
because it,

2392
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
it does,
it does reward an impulsivity that isn't

2393
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:49,630
always,
um,

2394
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:54,180
let's say my impulsivity that it isn't 
always in anyone's best interest.

2395
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:59,040
I made an agreement with my son too,
because he's been watching what I have,

2396
02:13:59,041 --> 02:13:59,874
lots of people watching what I'm doing 
and trying to keep me under some degree 

2397
02:14:02,761 --> 02:14:03,870
of control,
let's say,

2398
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:08,130
and his comment was that if I was going 
to,

2399
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,710
if it was serious enough to engage in 
twitter,

2400
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:15,711
combat about it was serious enough to 
write a blog post about and so I've kind

2401
02:14:15,761 --> 02:14:16,594
of made this rule which is I'm not going
to comment on anything on twitter and 

2402
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:21,594
that sort of manner unless I feel that 
writing about it at some length is 

2403
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:28,440
justifiable.
And so I started doing that this week.

2404
02:14:28,441 --> 02:14:31,620
I wrote three blog posts and that seems 
to have gone pretty well,

2405
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,370
so I hope that answered your question.

2406
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,353
Yep.

2407
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:49,623
Kind of go on a different topic.
I have a personality psychology 

2408
02:14:51,671 --> 02:14:52,720
question.
Okay.

2409
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:55,060
So when I did the understand myself 
quiz,

2410
02:14:55,061 --> 02:14:55,894
I was very surprised to find out that I 
was on the bottom two percentile for 

2411
02:14:58,421 --> 02:15:01,090
conscientiousness,
which I thought was an openness.

2412
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,980
Yes,
you're an entrepreneurial type.

2413
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,780
I'm going to need to partner with 
someone whose disciplines

2414
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,130
that's exactly.
See,

2415
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:12,173
there seems to be a real tension between
openness and especially orderliness was 

2416
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:18,023
open.
People while they think laterally and 

2417
02:15:19,731 --> 02:15:20,564
they blow boxes apart and they tend to 
make a mess when you're transforming 

2418
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:23,604
things and they're all over the place 
and they have to be because otherwise 

2419
02:15:26,281 --> 02:15:27,114
they wouldn't be open,
but it's hard to do that and also be 

2420
02:15:29,911 --> 02:15:34,560
orderly and conscientious and so and and
corporation suffer from this tension all

2421
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:35,161
the time.
Right?

2422
02:15:35,161 --> 02:15:35,994
Because they're started by open people,
but when they get going and get 

2423
02:15:40,231 --> 02:15:42,960
algorithmize they're run by 
conscientious people,

2424
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:43,823
but then the conscientious people can 
only go down one track and if the 

2425
02:15:45,931 --> 02:15:48,180
environment transforms,
the whole company disappears.

2426
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:52,230
So I would say you take a look at the 
conscientiousness score.

2427
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:53,753
You see if you can figure out how to 
discipline yourself a bit more and see 

2428
02:15:56,491 --> 02:15:58,440
if you can figure out how to schedule 
your time.

2429
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:02,370
Not like a prison but like a,
like a structured set of opportunities.

2430
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:06,390
And then you understand that in order to
be successful in life,

2431
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:07,224
likely in the medium to long run,
you're going to have to find someone 

2432
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:11,783
could be someone close to you,
could be be business partners or 

2433
02:16:13,621 --> 02:16:17,790
whatever that fill in that missing 
conscientiousness gap.

2434
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:20,130
So I guess the part B was,
uh,

2435
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:22,320
my boyfriend,
we've been together for a very long time

2436
02:16:22,321 --> 02:16:23,730
and we're not that old,
uh,

2437
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:24,564
is also very high in neuroticism.
And I feel that's where like our 

2438
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:29,130
conflict comes.
And as far as longterm,

2439
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:30,790
what are some things that,
you know,

2440
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:33,270
lowly,
conscientious and highly neurotic.

2441
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:38,320
So
we'll look into that.

2442
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,333
I mean the simple,
I can only high levels of neuroticism 

2443
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:53,650
are problematic interrelationship.
It's probably why 75 percent of divorces

2444
02:16:54,411 --> 02:16:58,130
are initiated by women because women are
higher in neuroticism.

2445
02:16:58,131 --> 02:16:58,964
That meant.
And I think the reason for that is that 

2446
02:17:00,441 --> 02:17:03,020
they have to be more sensitive to infant
distress.

2447
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:06,080
And so that makes them more sensitive to
distress in general.

2448
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:07,063
Now,
I don't know that for sure it's a 

2449
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:09,163
supposition,
but high levels of neuroticism do tend 

2450
02:17:11,361 --> 02:17:12,194
to make a relationship volatiles and and
and to put a fair bit of negative 

2451
02:17:15,531 --> 02:17:18,680
emotion into it and the question is 
where,

2452
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:21,680
what the source of the high level of 
neuroticism is.

2453
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:22,573
It might be purely temperamental,
but it also might be indicative of an 

2454
02:17:24,801 --> 02:17:27,110
underlying anxiety disorder,
depression or,

2455
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:28,123
or a physiological problem because they 
can manifest themselves in high levels 

2456
02:17:31,311 --> 02:17:32,144
of negative emotion and so there's 
always the possibility of doing 

2457
02:17:35,271 --> 02:17:36,104
something about that.
What I usually tell my clients who are 

2458
02:17:38,211 --> 02:17:40,520
high in neuroticism is two simple 
things.

2459
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:44,150
Number one,
get up at the same time in the morning.

2460
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,593
Okay,
because that helps stabilize your 

2461
02:17:46,461 --> 02:17:48,380
circadian rhythms.
Number two,

2462
02:17:48,710 --> 02:17:49,543
eat a large meal before you stress 
yourself in the morning and mostly 

2463
02:17:53,211 --> 02:17:54,044
protein and fat based because if you're 
high in neuroticism and you stress 

2464
02:17:58,071 --> 02:18:01,370
yourself before you eat you,
you disregulate your,

2465
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:04,430
your emotional reaction systems 
essentially,

2466
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:06,950
and you can't reregulate them until you 
sleep again.

2467
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:11,420
So other than that,
goodwill and understanding is about what

2468
02:18:11,421 --> 02:18:12,254
you've got

2469
02:18:15,550 --> 02:18:17,310
doing tonight.
Dr Pearson.

2470
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:22,560
Pretty good question.
So on the brutal side,

2471
02:18:22,561 --> 02:18:23,394
I might say,
but nervous to talk in front of you 

2472
02:18:26,581 --> 02:18:27,414
because you've got to be one of the most
formidable people that I've ever heard 

2473
02:18:29,911 --> 02:18:33,750
of or ever listened to every scene.
So my question is,

2474
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:34,943
again,
you're one of the best communicators 

2475
02:18:35,821 --> 02:18:40,821
that I've ever listened to.
If I could be half as good at you are at

2476
02:18:42,421 --> 02:18:45,240
communicating as you are,
I would be set.

2477
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:48,240
How can I teach myself to do that 
practice?

2478
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:50,630
You know,
really like,

2479
02:18:51,410 --> 02:18:56,060
well there's a couple of things is helps
to read a lot.

2480
02:18:57,230 --> 02:18:58,820
It really helps to.
Right?

2481
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:02,990
So if you want to make yourself 
articulate,

2482
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:08,600
which is a very good idea,
then not only should you read,

2483
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:10,910
but you should write down what you 
think.

2484
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:14,030
And if you can do that a little bit 
every day,

2485
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:15,553
15 minutes,
maybe you could steal 15 minutes and do 

2486
02:19:18,051 --> 02:19:21,080
it every day.
But if you do that for 10 years,

2487
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:25,220
you really straightened out.
You're thinking if you're going to speak

2488
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,073
effectively,
you have to know way more than you're 

2489
02:19:30,021 --> 02:19:31,130
talking about.
You know?

2490
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:31,993
So if you.
This is often difficult for beginning 

2491
02:19:33,681 --> 02:19:36,260
lectures at university because they'll 
do a lecture on a topic,

2492
02:19:36,261 --> 02:19:37,094
but they only know as much as they're 
saying in the lecture and they get kind 

2493
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:43,940
of stuck to their notes because of it,
but you want to know 10 times as much as

2494
02:19:43,941 --> 02:19:44,774
you are saying in the lecture and then 
you can specify a stepping path through 

2495
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:51,770
it and elaborate with the other things 
that you know.

2496
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:53,750
But to do that you have to do a lot of 
reading,

2497
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:57,410
but you also have to do a lot of reading
because that's where the synthesize,

2498
02:19:57,530 --> 02:20:01,850
that's where the synthesizing comes.
So that's on the input side.

2499
02:20:01,851 --> 02:20:04,820
And then on the output side,
well there's some tricks.

2500
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:08,630
Techniques let's say is like if you're 
speaking in front of a group,

2501
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:12,290
you are not delivering a talk to a 
group.

2502
02:20:13,250 --> 02:20:16,190
That's not what you're doing.
The talk isn't a packaged thing that you

2503
02:20:16,580 --> 02:20:18,950
present to a group.
There isn't a group,

2504
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:22,970
there's a bunch of individuals and you 
talk to them.

2505
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:24,043
So when I talked to a group,
I always talk to people one at a time 

2506
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:29,840
and that makes it easier too because you
know how to talk to a person.

2507
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:31,820
It's like,
can you talk to a thousand people?

2508
02:20:31,821 --> 02:20:33,830
Well probably not because it's too 
intimidating,

2509
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:36,140
but there isn't a thousand people there.

2510
02:20:36,590 --> 02:20:37,423
There's thousand individuals and so you 
just look at an individual and you say 

2511
02:20:41,511 --> 02:20:44,570
something and you can tell if they're 
engaged,

2512
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:46,123
they look confused or they look 
interested or they look angry or they 

2513
02:20:48,561 --> 02:20:49,394
look bored or maybe they're asleep,
in which case you look at someone else 

2514
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,370
and they give you feedback about how 
you're doing.

2515
02:20:55,371 --> 02:20:59,180
And so one thing is to have something to
say.

2516
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:00,373
Yeah,
the next thing is pay attention to who 

2517
02:21:02,421 --> 02:21:03,254
you're talking to because unless you're 
very badly socialized and that seems 

2518
02:21:07,641 --> 02:21:08,474
unlikely in your case because you know 
you present yourself at least 

2519
02:21:11,031 --> 02:21:11,930
moderately.
Well,

2520
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:13,970
you know,
and well,

2521
02:21:13,971 --> 02:21:15,860
I mean I don't know you very well but in
first,

2522
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:18,430
but on first sight,
you know you're,

2523
02:21:18,431 --> 02:21:19,264
you're doing fine.
So the probability that if you pay 

2524
02:21:20,841 --> 02:21:23,810
attention to the individuals that you're
talking to,

2525
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:29,050
that your natural wealth of,
of social skill will manifest itself,

2526
02:21:29,631 --> 02:21:30,464
is extremely high,
and so you don't deliver a talk to an 

2527
02:21:33,921 --> 02:21:34,754
audience.

2528
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:36,420
That's a really bad way of thinking 
about it.

2529
02:21:36,421 --> 02:21:38,870
You're actually engaged in a 
conversation with an audience,

2530
02:21:38,871 --> 02:21:39,704
even if they're not talking,
they're nodding and shifting position 

2531
02:21:43,551 --> 02:21:46,030
and you know,
looking like this or,

2532
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:48,820
and you can,
you can pull that in and,

2533
02:21:48,830 --> 02:21:49,663
and,
and use it to govern the level at which 

2534
02:21:52,551 --> 02:21:55,460
you're addressing the entire audience.
So

2535
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:00,980
the last thing I would say as well,
having the aim to be a good communicator

2536
02:22:00,981 --> 02:22:02,270
is a good start.
And you think,

2537
02:22:02,271 --> 02:22:03,104
well,
I can buttress that to some degree are 

2538
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:07,183
there isn't anything that you can boss.
This is the whole point of a liberal 

2539
02:22:09,501 --> 02:22:10,334
education.
There isn't anything that you can 

2540
02:22:11,751 --> 02:22:16,751
possibly do that makes you more 
competent in everything you do.

2541
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,433
Then to learn how to communicate.
I don't care if you're going to be a 

2542
02:22:20,211 --> 02:22:21,044
carpenter.
I mean being a carpenter by the way is 

2543
02:22:22,131 --> 02:22:24,110
very difficult,
especially if you're a good carpenter.

2544
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:27,090
But if you're good at communicating as a
carpenter,

2545
02:22:27,091 --> 02:22:31,470
you're like 10 times better as a carpet.
So the,

2546
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:34,770
and this is something that the liberal 
arts colleges,

2547
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:36,970
I think,
I don't know if they've forgotten it,

2548
02:22:36,971 --> 02:22:38,760
but they don't do a very good job of 
marketing.

2549
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:39,121
It's like,
well,

2550
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:42,030
what's the use of a bachelor's degree in
Bachelor of arts?

2551
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:42,864
It's like,
well,

2552
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:45,480
you can think,
you can write,

2553
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,480
you can speak.
You've read something.

2554
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:52,890
It's like the economic value that is 
incalculable.

2555
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:54,203
The people that I've watched in my life 
who've been spectacularly successful 

2556
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,030
are.
They have skills.

2557
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:05,750
Clearly that's a minimum precondition,
but they're also very,

2558
02:23:05,971 --> 02:23:06,804
very good at articulating the shells.
And so whenever they negotiate their 

2559
02:23:10,381 --> 02:23:11,214
successful well,
that's kind of like the definition of 

2560
02:23:13,381 --> 02:23:14,490
success in life,
right?

2561
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,473
You negotiate and you're six.
It doesn't mean you win because if 

2562
02:23:17,491 --> 02:23:20,280
you're a good negotiator,
if you're really good negotiator,

2563
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,533
everybody walks away from the 
negotiation derailed and so then people 

2564
02:23:25,561 --> 02:23:28,290
line up to do things with you.
So.

2565
02:23:28,291 --> 02:23:29,124
And that's all.
That's all dependent on your ability to 

2566
02:23:30,631 --> 02:23:33,120
communicate.
So practice.

2567
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:34,913
Thank you very much.

2568
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,410
Oh,
thanks.

2569
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:50,243
Sorry I have.
There's a section of the book in here 

2570
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:57,141
that I just want to talk about here.
Confident young man.

2571
02:23:58,770 --> 02:23:59,603
Rule 11 of this book here.
Don't bother children when you're 

2572
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:04,110
skateboarding.
Well,

2573
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:05,003
the small bone to pick with Lafayette 
college is that my brother does get 

2574
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:07,944
stopped skateboarding here,
but that's not the surprise of my 

2575
02:24:09,661 --> 02:24:11,400
questions today.
I'm really.

2576
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:12,234
I have two key questions.
You said in one lecture that Alexander 

2577
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:16,223
Soldier nation basically memorize the 
other work to bring it out and to show 

2578
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:20,004
the world,
but I've had professors who started to 

2579
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:25,320
be in ones that are very studied on 
Slavic Culture and studied on the Gulag.

2580
02:24:25,350 --> 02:24:28,110
Tell me essentially that he was a kgb 
agent.

2581
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:29,790
I mean,
would you agree with that statement that

2582
02:24:29,791 --> 02:24:30,624
the only way that he would have been 
able to get all that stuff out of their 

2583
02:24:32,180 --> 02:24:36,450
live in there for 20 years and not die 
or starve to death was from that?

2584
02:24:37,030 --> 02:24:39,660
What do you don't really have anything 
to say about that?

2585
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:41,340
I mean,
anything's possible,

2586
02:24:41,341 --> 02:24:46,260
but probably not that.
Probably not that KGB agent like I don't

2587
02:24:46,261 --> 02:24:49,320
know why anyone would tell you that.
What's your evidence for that?

2588
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:51,900
It's an impossible for him to have 
documented that.

2589
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:55,550
That must've been a kgb agent,
like memorize all of that.

2590
02:24:55,570 --> 02:24:56,403
Getting out of prison
was your writing in prison and he 

2591
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:03,630
couldn't.
He couldn't have done anything.

2592
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:07,560
You'd be amazed at what people can 
remember when they have to remember.

2593
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:12,470
So people remember very large volumes of
material when they're,

2594
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:15,930
when that's what they have.
I get like preliterate people.

2595
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,823
No.
All they did was remember I have a 

2596
02:25:18,691 --> 02:25:21,000
friend who's not literate and what he 
can.

2597
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:23,040
I have two friends that aren't really 
very literate.

2598
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,160
One of them is really not

2599
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:28,600
literate and what he can remember,
you just can't believe are modern people

2600
02:25:28,601 --> 02:25:30,640
don't remember much because we don't 
have to.

2601
02:25:30,641 --> 02:25:34,560
We write it down and externalize it,
but our capacity for memory is,

2602
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:35,453
is far greater than you realize the 
shake from when the Greeks switch from 

2603
02:25:38,861 --> 02:25:40,840
an oral culture to a literary culture 
was very fascinating.

2604
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,160
But my second question before I go sit 
back down with,

2605
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:44,940
um,
how do you feel about the influence of,

2606
02:25:44,941 --> 02:25:45,470
uh,
and I,

2607
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:46,303
you know,
with reading Terence Mckenna and things 

2608
02:25:46,931 --> 02:25:47,764
along these lines,
the humans of psychedelics within our 

2609
02:25:48,971 --> 02:25:52,510
culture and how that,
and what that does to the human psyche.

2610
02:25:52,511 --> 02:25:54,550
I know that the guy who,
God only knows,

2611
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:57,693
I don't think we understand.
We don't understand psychedelics one 

2612
02:26:00,751 --> 02:26:02,780
bit,
so

2613
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:06,720
I don't think we understand that forest,
they,

2614
02:26:07,430 --> 02:26:08,263
what would you play the role that 
they've played in our religious and 

2615
02:26:10,701 --> 02:26:11,534
cognitive evolution.
So we don't understand that they're an 

2616
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:18,500
absolute mystery.
So

2617
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:25,390
play with them at your peril.
Acid.

2618
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:28,933
Yeah.
Yeah.

2619
02:26:29,150 --> 02:26:29,983
Swiss,
a pretty strange place for that emerged 

2620
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:33,520
from.
But yeah,

2621
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:38,710
reference the chairs and for random 
audience members.

2622
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:39,563
The sentence

2623
02:26:46,170 --> 02:26:49,010
in a lot of your talks,
you speak about the things that the west

2624
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:49,853
you'd correct.
And I'm curious yourself being a 

2625
02:26:51,631 --> 02:26:55,020
psychologist,
what your thoughts are on Edward Bernays

2626
02:26:55,021 --> 02:26:57,120
and the impact that he had on Western 
society.

2627
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,073
The,
um,

2628
02:26:59,220 --> 02:27:00,053
the guiding of masses are controlling 
them and being able to take control in 

2629
02:27:04,381 --> 02:27:05,214
that way.

2630
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,960
No,
I don't know enough about them.

2631
02:27:06,961 --> 02:27:09,040
I'm afraid to give you an intelligent 
answer.

2632
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:10,503
So do you have,
do you have another question because 

2633
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:14,470
that's rather disappointed.
I imagine

2634
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:16,230
a shared.
Um,

2635
02:27:16,580 --> 02:27:18,500
my other question would be that,
uh,

2636
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:19,433
to my understanding that work control 
and people's control is instrumental in 

2637
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,533
the idea of socialism and if these 
countries that we call socialist and 

2638
02:27:29,621 --> 02:27:33,760
communist are totalitarian states ruled 
by a single party or a single man,

2639
02:27:35,830 --> 02:27:38,110
why do we continue referring to them as 
such

2640
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:41,250
as referring them to,
as,

2641
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:45,530
as socialists,
as when they don't follow the main heart

2642
02:27:45,531 --> 02:27:46,150
of it?
Yeah.

2643
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,970
Good or control?
It's a good question.

2644
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,220
I don't,
I don't really know the answer to that.

2645
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:54,400
It looks like,
who knows,

2646
02:27:54,401 --> 02:27:55,120
right.
Maybe,

2647
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:55,953
maybe the,
maybe the inevitable end product of a 

2648
02:27:58,421 --> 02:28:01,780
collectivist view point is something 
like a totalitarian state.

2649
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:03,213
It seems probable because most human 
governments have been essentially 

2650
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:10,570
totalitarian states have one degree of 
severity or another.

2651
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:15,970
So the tribal tendency might manifest 
itself in a rigid hierarchy,

2652
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,520
but it is,
it is a perverse fact.

2653
02:28:18,570 --> 02:28:19,403
Right.
And you think that it's one of the 

2654
02:28:20,621 --> 02:28:23,990
mysteries about the continual 
apologetics for the radical left.

2655
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:24,824
It's like,
well,

2656
02:28:24,830 --> 02:28:28,550
didn't China just announced that it's 
president is now president for life.

2657
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:31,830
So that's actually a big problem.
Well,

2658
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:33,273
and despite the fact that they've moved 
quite a distance in the free market 

2659
02:28:35,961 --> 02:28:36,794
direction,
obviously that underlying totalitarian 

2660
02:28:39,711 --> 02:28:44,450
impulse is still alive then and well and
thriving.

2661
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:45,583
I mean,
and what the Chinese are doing with 

2662
02:28:46,470 --> 02:28:49,370
electronic surveillance should make 
everyone's hair stand on end.

2663
02:28:50,050 --> 02:28:52,470
So
yeah.

2664
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:57,670
Thank you.
Hi,

2665
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:12,240
Dr Peterson
to

2666
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:16,733
Mike Range.

2667
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:19,713
It's a pleasure to ask you a question.
I wrote it down to minimize 

2668
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:26,340
inarticulate.
So you,

2669
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:29,950
you put a great emphasis on truth in 
your work.

2670
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:31,083
Uh,
so this is your writing in 12 rules for 

2671
02:29:32,411 --> 02:29:34,900
life and above all,
don't lie.

2672
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:38,530
Don't lie about anything ever lying 
leads to hell.

2673
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:39,933
It was the great and the small eyes of 
the Nazis and communists states that 

2674
02:29:42,461 --> 02:29:44,230
produce the deaths of tens of millions 
of people.

2675
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,823
And you've also talked about how niche 
of foresaw the nihilism implicit in 

2676
02:29:49,931 --> 02:29:52,100
European culture in the 18 hundreds,
uh,

2677
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:53,013
that would likely lead to the 
authoritarianism and death tolls 

2678
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,800
mentioned at the end of the previous 
quote.

2679
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,113
Uh,
and I find this interesting for the 

2680
02:29:58,811 --> 02:29:59,830
following reason.
Uh,

2681
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:04,840
so here's Nisha and the will to power 
radical nihilism is the conviction of an

2682
02:30:04,991 --> 02:30:08,470
absolute untenable out of existence when
it comes to the highest values.

2683
02:30:08,471 --> 02:30:09,304
One recognizes this realization is a 
consequence of the cultivation of 

2684
02:30:13,211 --> 02:30:15,610
truthfulness.
So in other words,

2685
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:17,290
a Nisha saw the,
uh,

2686
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:20,740
that valuing truth to it's fullest 
undercuts valuation itself.

2687
02:30:21,330 --> 02:30:22,163
Yeah.
He specifically within a Christian 

2688
02:30:23,821 --> 02:30:24,900
context,
by the way,

2689
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,490
I mean,
one of the things that,

2690
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:31,660
that need you in his role as Christian 
critic pointed out was that the death of

2691
02:30:33,121 --> 02:30:38,121
God was a consequence in his formulation
of the Christian insistence on truth.

2692
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:40,223
So his,
his idea was essentially that as 

2693
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:48,870
Christianity elevated the truth to the 
position of highest moral virtue,

2694
02:30:48,871 --> 02:30:49,704
and then that truth seeking spirit 
develop scientific and rational 

2695
02:30:55,531 --> 02:30:59,100
viewpoint,
that the logical consequence of that was

2696
02:30:59,310 --> 02:31:00,143
the turning of the spirit of truth.
On the metaphysical presumptions of 

2697
02:31:03,631 --> 02:31:06,510
Christianity itself.
So that's the context for that.

2698
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:07,750
So

2699
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:08,583
I wanted to ask you is that you appear 
to care deeply about meeting and the 

2700
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:13,293
philosophical problem of nihilism.
So I was just wondering if you could 

2701
02:31:15,970 --> 02:31:16,803
elaborate on this tension between 
nihilism and truth in light of what 

2702
02:31:20,911 --> 02:31:21,744
you're saying and whether there's a way 
in which you see your ideas as 

2703
02:31:26,881 --> 02:31:27,714
elaborated in your latest book as a 
solution to the problem of nihilism or 

2704
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:34,590
how they fit into the broader.
Great question.

2705
02:31:35,330 --> 02:31:36,163
Um,

2706
02:31:36,350 --> 02:31:37,183
I think,
I think really the young's work is the 

2707
02:31:39,531 --> 02:31:40,364
answer to that question because yoga was
profoundly influenced by Freud 

2708
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,333
obviously.
And if you read the Freudian 

2709
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:50,953
biographers,
let's say it's easy to conceptualize 

2710
02:31:54,261 --> 02:31:59,030
young as an acolyte of Freud,
but it's not really accurate,

2711
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:00,073
I wouldn't say or it's insufficiently 
accurate because Freud had a great 

2712
02:32:03,471 --> 02:32:04,304
influence on you,
but you was also exceptionally 

2713
02:32:06,771 --> 02:32:11,771
influenced by niching and you'll,
I think you can also view piaget in this

2714
02:32:12,141 --> 02:32:12,974
matter by the way,
although not directly as a consequence 

2715
02:32:14,661 --> 02:32:16,460
of the influence of niche.
It'd be more indirect,

2716
02:32:16,461 --> 02:32:17,294
but young really regarded what he was 
doing as an answer to niches question 

2717
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:26,960
and the question is something like,
well,

2718
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:29,593
the inquirer inquiring western rational 
mind has murdered the metaphysical 

2719
02:32:34,851 --> 02:32:39,851
presuppositions of Western society.
Now what now niches idea was,

2720
02:32:41,421 --> 02:32:43,580
well,
we would have to invent our own values.

2721
02:32:43,581 --> 02:32:45,950
We would have to become a new type of 
being,

2722
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:47,713
but your response to that,
especially after World War Two was and 

2723
02:32:52,221 --> 02:32:54,170
after encountering Freud was something 
like,

2724
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,353
well,
what makes you think we can invent our 

2725
02:32:56,571 --> 02:32:57,404
own values?
So Neil Young's idea was to rediscover 

2726
02:33:02,871 --> 02:33:04,700
the values of the past,
to go within.

2727
02:33:04,701 --> 02:33:05,534
That was his hero's journey to go within
in the landscape of the imagination and 

2728
02:33:08,931 --> 02:33:09,764
to rekindle the archetypes.
That isn't necessarily something that 

2729
02:33:11,961 --> 02:33:14,390
has to be done as an internal voyage,
but

2730
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:18,990
that made it.
That made the process something that was

2731
02:33:18,991 --> 02:33:21,330
more akin to an archetypical 
transformation.

2732
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,193
So if it's the father that's dead,
then you go into the belly of the beast 

2733
02:33:26,281 --> 02:33:29,370
to revitalize the father.
That's the pathway forward.

2734
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:30,653
And that's been the pathway forward for 
human beings for for as long back as we 

2735
02:33:34,921 --> 02:33:39,921
know for tens of thousands of years.
Yeah.

2736
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:44,100
Well,
I think I'm saying that right.

2737
02:33:44,101 --> 02:33:46,950
Some Romanian wrote me the other day and
tried to teach me how to say it.

2738
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,810
Merchant.
I think that's right.

2739
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:53,840
Eliana talked about the the death of God
as a recurring phenomena.

2740
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:55,343
I mean that's what he.
That's when he realized when he did his 

2741
02:33:59,731 --> 02:34:00,564
large scale surveys of religious belief 
systems is the God dies very frequently 

2742
02:34:05,850 --> 02:34:06,683
and then that's part of it.
That's part of what you might describe 

2743
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:10,014
as a developmental process.
It's very much akin to what happens to 

2744
02:34:12,241 --> 02:34:13,890
you when your dreams die.

2745
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:15,143
You know,
when you put forward a hypothesis about 

2746
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:19,300
mode of being that you would like to 
embody.

2747
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:22,060
You have a dream,
a vision and ambition,

2748
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:22,983
maybe a love affair or something like 
that and it collapses on you when 

2749
02:34:25,740 --> 02:34:28,540
there's a period of death that follows 
that.

2750
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:33,160
You could call it psychological death,
but then there's a reconstruction of the

2751
02:34:33,161 --> 02:34:35,350
value system and a rebirth,
and that's.

2752
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:38,620
That's the eternal human story.
It really is.

2753
02:34:39,550 --> 02:34:42,130
Now,
Young's contribution to niches,

2754
02:34:42,131 --> 02:34:42,964
body of thought,
and this is where I think also dusty 

2755
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:46,373
does the surpassed Mnuchin,
was that you realized that we didn't 

2756
02:34:49,571 --> 02:34:50,404
invent our own values.
We rediscovered those values that we 

2757
02:34:52,991 --> 02:34:55,390
always harbored within us.
Now,

2758
02:34:55,391 --> 02:34:56,224
that doesn't mean that that,
that they still have to be given new 

2759
02:34:58,841 --> 02:34:59,674
form,
though you see this in an old story of 

2760
02:35:02,141 --> 02:35:03,870
the Egyptian,
there's an old story of Horus.

2761
02:35:03,871 --> 02:35:04,704
No,
Cyrus and horace goes to rescue his 

2762
02:35:06,911 --> 02:35:07,320
father.

2763
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:07,931
Oh,
Cyrus,

2764
02:35:07,931 --> 02:35:11,710
who's basically living like a dead ghost
in the underworld.

2765
02:35:11,711 --> 02:35:12,544
He goes to rescue him after defeating 
his evil uncle goes to rescue his dead 

2766
02:35:15,941 --> 02:35:16,774
father,
and when he goes down into the 

2767
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:19,280
underworld,
he,

2768
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:22,930
he has an I in his hand that seth,
the evil one,

2769
02:35:23,650 --> 02:35:24,483
tore from his head during their combat 
and instead of putting the [inaudible] 

2770
02:35:27,191 --> 02:35:28,024
back in his head,
he gives it to his father and then his 

2771
02:35:30,011 --> 02:35:30,844
father can see again,
and then they both go back up to the 

2772
02:35:33,701 --> 02:35:38,380
surface of the world and it's their 
union that constitutes the spirit of the

2773
02:35:38,381 --> 02:35:39,214
Pharaoh.
It's an absolutely unbelievably 

2774
02:35:40,961 --> 02:35:43,240
remarkable story because the idea is,
well,

2775
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:47,200
you will be damaged in your 
confrontation with life,

2776
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:48,273
particularly if you confront malevolence
because the confrontation with 

2777
02:35:50,921 --> 02:35:53,470
malevolence damages people that will 
damage your vision,

2778
02:35:54,430 --> 02:35:57,490
but if you,
if you take that damaged part of you and

2779
02:35:57,491 --> 02:36:01,030
you read united with the dead spirit of 
your father,

2780
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:02,800
then you can revitalize that.

2781
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:03,633
That will strengthen you and that will 
enable you to move forward into the 

2782
02:36:05,561 --> 02:36:06,394
future.
So like that's just exactly right and 

2783
02:36:08,531 --> 02:36:13,531
it's one of the deepest religious
presuppositions of humanity.

2784
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,150
You see it everywhere.
That idea,

2785
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:17,830
and that's what you're doing in 
university.

2786
02:36:17,831 --> 02:36:19,840
If you take a liberal arts course 
degree,

2787
02:36:20,650 --> 02:36:22,100
it's like you're,
you're,

2788
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:26,440
you're resurrecting your dead ancestors 
so they can live again in your form,

2789
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:27,393
but in conjoined union with you,
you're the vision that gives the dead 

2790
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:31,513
past its vitality and spirit,
and that's the purpose of being 

2791
02:36:35,321 --> 02:36:36,154
educated.
That's a,

2792
02:36:36,370 --> 02:36:37,203
that's your initiation and and partly 
what you do when you're initiated 

2793
02:36:41,411 --> 02:36:42,244
properly in that regard.
As you develop a comprehensive 

2794
02:36:43,751 --> 02:36:46,540
philosophy of good and evil,
a deep philosophy of good and evil,

2795
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:47,703
evil,
and that protects you against the 

2796
02:36:48,851 --> 02:36:52,150
confrontation with malevolence and I 
know that you know,

2797
02:36:52,151 --> 02:36:52,984
I know that not least because one of the
things that's happened to me as a 

2798
02:36:57,161 --> 02:36:57,994
consequence and putting all these 
lectures online is that I've had many 

2799
02:36:59,951 --> 02:37:00,784
military people write me and come and 
talk to me who had posttraumatic stress 

2800
02:37:05,171 --> 02:37:07,840
disorder and that's almost always a 
consequence.

2801
02:37:08,110 --> 02:37:11,200
Often have them viewing themselves do 
something dreadful,

2802
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:12,273
but sometimes viewing that occurring as 
a consequence of other people's actions 

2803
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:18,680
until they have a philosophy of good and
evil,

2804
02:37:18,681 --> 02:37:19,514
they can't recover from their 
posttraumatic stress disorder and like 

2805
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:23,540
you,
you,

2806
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:26,240
if you're naive,
metaphysically naive,

2807
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:29,960
and you come in contact with someone who
truly wants to hurt you,

2808
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:33,590
the probability that that will undo you 
psychologically is very,

2809
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:37,580
very high.
So you have to be wise as serpents.

2810
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:40,820
That's the old saying.
You have to be wise as a serpent because

2811
02:37:40,821 --> 02:37:42,860
otherwise you have no protection against
serpents.

2812
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:52,513
Maybe we'll do two more because I'm 
starting to get fuzzy minded and I've 

2813
02:37:55,281 --> 02:38:00,281
learned to quit at that point mostly.
So we talked a bit before.

2814
02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:02,690
Yeah,
before you started.

2815
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:06,680
Don't know exactly how to phrase this 
and I think that this will be like,

2816
02:38:06,890 --> 02:38:09,860
I do want to like acknowledge that all 
of this q and a has been amazing because

2817
02:38:09,861 --> 02:38:10,694
it's basically been a lecturer mixed 
with reality and that's a good 

2818
02:38:14,061 --> 02:38:14,990
combination.
Yeah,

2819
02:38:14,991 --> 02:38:15,824
it's a good combination and I don't 
think many speakers I go to actually 

2820
02:38:20,031 --> 02:38:22,040
know how to combine that the way you 
did.

2821
02:38:22,041 --> 02:38:24,590
So thank you for that.
But uh,

2822
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:25,963
I guess this question is a bit of a 
departure from that and it's sort of 

2823
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:28,753
going to something more of a say I don't
think everyone can relate to because 

2824
02:38:33,531 --> 02:38:34,364
it's in your book you say don't lie.
And I think that after living 21 short 

2825
02:38:39,471 --> 02:38:40,940
years,
I've learned that the hard way,

2826
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:44,660
but you and your life and me and my 
life,

2827
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:45,763
I feel like we both had a moment where 
we've had to confront a self alienating 

2828
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:52,363
instance of nature where there is no 
path forward that we really have at our 

2829
02:38:56,451 --> 02:38:57,284
disposal and
there was a point where an unnatural 

2830
02:39:01,671 --> 02:39:03,350
amount of growth had to come out of us.

2831
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:08,980
So I just want to know where you drew 
that line at your own ability to develop

2832
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:14,231
as a person to where you didn't become 
tunnel vision with trying to face life's

2833
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:16,070
problems on your own or.

2834
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:17,243
Okay.
Well we had talked just before this 

2835
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,433
second part of this q and a about my 
daughter's illness and about this 

2836
02:39:22,351 --> 02:39:24,780
gentleman's had illness in his family 
too.

2837
02:39:24,781 --> 02:39:27,970
So that's Kinda the background of this.
Well the first part of that is like

2838
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:34,980
if we were going to be pessimistically 
realistic about all this,

2839
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:40,670
I would say that your best bet is truth.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that's

2840
02:39:42,061 --> 02:39:44,430
always going to do the trick,
right?

2841
02:39:44,431 --> 02:39:49,431
I mean sometimes you go fight a dragon 
entity to you and if the,

2842
02:39:50,550 --> 02:39:53,430
if you being eaten wasn't a real 
possibility,

2843
02:39:53,940 --> 02:39:57,060
it wouldn't be a real fight.
And so you see people,

2844
02:39:57,061 --> 02:39:57,894
like I've seen people
in my clinical practice sometimes I had 

2845
02:40:02,881 --> 02:40:03,714
one client in particular who was 
undergoing a particularly vicious 

2846
02:40:06,631 --> 02:40:07,464
divorce with someone who was really 
seriously inclined to take him out and 

2847
02:40:11,731 --> 02:40:15,450
would do pretty much everything at her 
disposal to do so.

2848
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:16,703
And I strategized with him for about 
three years and we did everything like 

2849
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:25,710
at hyper carefully and he was a very 
conscientious and diligent person and he

2850
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:26,993
put into practice everything that we 
discussed and strategized and he still 

2851
02:40:30,031 --> 02:40:32,850
pretty much,
he got backed into a corner so hard that

2852
02:40:32,851 --> 02:40:34,110
I didn't know how to help them anymore.

2853
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:40,040
So high would say however that he like.
He was a very truthful person throughout

2854
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:40,943
that.
And one thing he did do was part of it 

2855
02:40:43,201 --> 02:40:44,034
was a custody battle and he did manage,
despite his declined in consequence of 

2856
02:40:51,271 --> 02:40:53,250
being repeatedly cornered,
I would say.

2857
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:54,533
He did manage to establish what I think 
was a lasting relationship with his 

2858
02:40:57,571 --> 02:41:02,040
kids.
So he might've got enough out of what he

2859
02:41:02,041 --> 02:41:02,874
did to justify it,
even though the whole landscape was 

2860
02:41:06,211 --> 02:41:11,211
pretty awful.
I think that not lying is your best bet,

2861
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:14,153
but life is hard and people get run over
and it doesn't necessarily mean that 

2862
02:41:19,291 --> 02:41:22,080
you're going to emerge in any obvious 
sense triumphant.

2863
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:26,190
But if you take the alternative path 
path,

2864
02:41:26,191 --> 02:41:29,730
especially when you're facing severe 
tribulations,

2865
02:41:29,731 --> 02:41:32,760
let's say,
and you complicate those with deceit,

2866
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:36,420
you can be sure that whatever tragedy 
that you're confronting is going to turn

2867
02:41:36,421 --> 02:41:39,780
into not only tragedy,
but something very much akin to hell.

2868
02:41:40,830 --> 02:41:44,730
And so you might be able to at least 
minimize the degree of suffering even if

2869
02:41:44,731 --> 02:41:49,290
you can't overcome it or transcendent.
And that's something,

2870
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:51,800
you know,
it's something I,

2871
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:52,883
I'm always reminded in a discussion like
this of what I watched with my wife's 

2872
02:41:56,821 --> 02:41:59,460
family were around the deathbed of her 
mother.

2873
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:02,970
She had
frontal temporal dementia,

2874
02:42:02,971 --> 02:42:05,730
which is like Alzheimer's and quite an 
awful way to go.

2875
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:07,523
And,
uh,

2876
02:42:08,310 --> 02:42:11,130
her husband,
my father in law,

2877
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:16,080
really stepped up to the plate.
Like he was quite the man about town,

2878
02:42:16,081 --> 02:42:19,290
very extroverted partier type and quite 
disagreeable.

2879
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:21,000
But when his wife got sick,
man,

2880
02:42:21,330 --> 02:42:22,163
he was there,
it was something to watch and so he 

2881
02:42:24,511 --> 02:42:25,344
turned what could have been absolutely 
dreadful into just miserable and then 

2882
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:32,810
when their entire family was gathered 
around her death bed,

2883
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:37,820
like my wife and her sister had both 
dealt with dying people before and other

2884
02:42:39,721 --> 02:42:40,554
sister was a pharmacist and they were 
attentive to their mother and there was 

2885
02:42:45,691 --> 02:42:46,524
no foolish catastrophes going on between
the family and they all pulled together 

2886
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:56,820
and so their mother died.
But what I observed was that their bonds

2887
02:42:56,821 --> 02:42:57,654
were strengthened as a consequence and 
that they gained something from the 

2888
02:43:01,381 --> 02:43:02,214
tightening of the remaining 
relationships that was at least partial 

2889
02:43:04,681 --> 02:43:06,510
compensation for the loss of their 
mother.

2890
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:10,710
And that beat the hell out of squabbling
about everything while she was dying.

2891
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:14,170
Because that's a real possibility.
And people certainly do that.

2892
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:15,773
So

2893
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:22,700
one more,
and maybe we'll call it a night.

2894
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:33,130
The one thing that has been kind of 
going through my mind in this discussion

2895
02:43:33,791 --> 02:43:36,750
in general,
personally,

2896
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:37,733
one of the most interesting aspects of 
neuroscience to me is the capacity to 

2897
02:43:43,691 --> 02:43:48,691
change the adaptive.
But I think that the issue in your talks

2898
02:43:49,151 --> 02:43:52,330
and you know you're already doing so 
that people

2899
02:43:54,760 --> 02:43:55,593
can be
five points that will never be stagnant 

2900
02:44:00,281 --> 02:44:01,114
and not to shame therapy.
They don't really understand that maybe 

2901
02:44:05,411 --> 02:44:09,520
to the love that they should be.
Right.

2902
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:14,580
And so my opinion is that that indicates
a little bit of a paragraph that was,

2903
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,380
you know,
we are wired,

2904
02:44:17,381 --> 02:44:20,920
we are hardwired essentially adapt to 
change.

2905
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:24,800
We're able to change ourselves to 
respond to the same line,

2906
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:26,800
our environmental,
our brand itself,

2907
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:29,260
not just our behavior,
but the actual,

2908
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:32,140
the in our vision of what's actually 
changing.

2909
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,600
So you're already is that a lot of 
people will become,

2910
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,640
you know,
to this and they'll stay stagnant.

2911
02:44:36,641 --> 02:44:37,474
So how do you explain what aspects of 
cultural phenomena or just social 

2912
02:44:41,501 --> 02:44:44,200
discourse,
what is so powerful about that,

2913
02:44:44,201 --> 02:44:47,000
that it overcomes,
are predisposed conditions?

2914
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:50,910
Well,
changes changes,

2915
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:56,920
especially if it's the more radical than
necessary change.

2916
02:44:56,921 --> 02:45:00,630
The more pain that accompanies it,
like the more opportunity as well.

2917
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:02,820
But,
and a lot of what we learned,

2918
02:45:02,821 --> 02:45:03,654
we learned painfully.
And so it's not surprising that people 

2919
02:45:05,851 --> 02:45:06,684
shrink away from learning.
We learn in pain and anxiety very 

2920
02:45:09,721 --> 02:45:11,160
frequently.
Everyone knows that,

2921
02:45:11,220 --> 02:45:14,190
like the things that really that you 
really learned in life,

2922
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:19,220
it's like it was no joy man and get took
you out and so the fact that people flee

2923
02:45:19,271 --> 02:45:23,220
from that is hardly surprising,
but it doesn't help.

2924
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:24,083
That's the thing.
It just stores up the catastrophe for 

2925
02:45:26,191 --> 02:45:31,191
later and so the better the better ideas
to eat a little poison every day so that

2926
02:45:31,711 --> 02:45:32,544
you don't have to overdose in a month.
It's something like that and it is the 

2927
02:45:36,421 --> 02:45:41,421
case that I think because you don't,
you aren't forced.

2928
02:45:41,610 --> 02:45:42,443
First of all,
you don't learn unless you're forced to 

2929
02:45:43,531 --> 02:45:44,100
learn.

2930
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:44,933
I know there's alternatives to that.
There's the voluntary search for 

2931
02:45:47,161 --> 02:45:50,730
knowledge and that's a fine thing and 
that is an antidote to this,

2932
02:45:50,970 --> 02:45:55,260
but apart from that,
speaking more practically,

2933
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:56,903
you tend not to learn unless you're 
forced to learn and it's and what you 

2934
02:46:00,181 --> 02:46:01,014
tend to learn by force or difficult 
lessons and so people are very prone to 

2935
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:10,190
not to not seek that out.
It's not surprising,

2936
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,000
but it's because they don't understand 
the consequences very well.

2937
02:46:15,570 --> 02:46:16,610
You know,
you,

2938
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:17,503
you.
It's because maybe it's because they're 

2939
02:46:19,730 --> 02:46:20,563
convinced that there's some way of 
forestalling the necessary learning and 

2940
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:24,943
there isn't any way of forestalling it.
All you do is make it worse in the 

2941
02:46:28,311 --> 02:46:29,144
future.
You make yourself smaller and you make 

2942
02:46:30,651 --> 02:46:31,484
the lesson harder,
and so that's why in so many religious 

2943
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:40,300
doctrines there's emphasis on humility.
Humility is to debase yourself.

2944
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:42,933
It's to understand that you don't know 
enough so that your life isn't going to 

2945
02:46:46,371 --> 02:46:51,371
be miserable and so every chance you get
to grab something new that will help you

2946
02:46:51,831 --> 02:46:55,280
along your way.
You should take it as fast as you can,

2947
02:46:55,730 --> 02:47:00,470
but you have to have a very
tragic,

2948
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:02,173
I would say,
view of reality and also harsh one 

2949
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:06,710
because it's not just tragedy.
It's also malevolence.

2950
02:47:06,711 --> 02:47:07,544
You have to understand that those are 
waiting for you and that makes you 

2951
02:47:11,001 --> 02:47:15,740
desperate enough to learn and that might
be make you desperate enough to fall out

2952
02:47:15,741 --> 02:47:19,040
of the radiology,
but that's.

2953
02:47:19,270 --> 02:47:23,780
That's a hard way of looking at the 
world beats living through it though.

2954
02:47:27,310 --> 02:47:32,310
It's was very nice talking to you.
Thank you.
