1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,750
Today we're going to talk about pretty 
much ends the section on traits

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,960
and we're going to talk today about the 
practical utility of traits.

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:19,070
Essentially.
It's always nice if you're doing

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,930
psychological research to have a hard 
target.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,920
No,
it's it.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,013
It turns out to be relatively uncommon 
amongst psychological researchers to 

7
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:36,500
actually try to predict something.
I mean if you use a regression equation,

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,423
which is what most of the stats that 
you'd use if you were doing psychology 

9
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:40,784
research or based on the purpose of the 
experiment or the research 

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,233
hypothetically is the derivation of a 
regression equation that might enable 

11
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,030
you to predict something useful in the 
future.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,283
But in in psychology,
a lot of that is devolved into sort of 

13
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:56,894
descriptive work.
Showing that two groups differ on some 

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,993
trait or some feature,
but the actual utility of knowing that 

15
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:11,120
is not.
It's not self evident.

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,853
It's partly why I got interested in 
prediction in performance prediction 

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,703
because
you can measure performance and it 

18
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:23,424
actually matters.
So that would be performance creatively 

19
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:31,311
say or academically or if you're working
in an industrial area,

20
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:32,964
so just say as a factory worker or in a 
job that can be reduced to essentially 

21
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:37,734
an algorithm.
So if you're in a job that can be 

22
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,490
reduced to an algorithm,
once you learn it,

23
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:45,120
you know how to do it.
So those are simpler jobs.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,073
Um,
and then performance in complex jobs as 

25
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:51,180
well.
Performance as an entrepreneur,

26
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,014
those are all

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,193
in some sense real world phenomena.
Although of course you still have a 

28
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,990
measurement problem,
right?

29
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,640
So if you're trying to measure,
for example,

30
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,720
how successful middle managers are in a 
corporation,

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,740
it's not that easy to specify because 
you know,

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,730
if you're measuring the performance of 
salesman,

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,573
you can see how much they sold and then 
you have a performance measure that's 

34
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,084
basically defacto.
But if you're trying to measure their 

35
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,180
performance of managers say,
and we'll say in an institution like the

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,150
University of Toronto or even in a 
profit making institution,

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,870
their connection with outside 
marketplace is not.

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,960
It's not immediately obvious.
So then you might ask,

39
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,794
well,
how in the world could you assess their 

40
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,374
performance?
And the way it's generally done is when 

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,890
you can have them rate themselves that 
has all these problems,

42
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,340
but you know it's not without validity,
completely without validity.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,620
You could have their managers rate them.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,503
I'm that assume that their managers know
what they're doing and that they're 

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,373
accurate.
Judges have their actual quality of 

46
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,040
performance.
You can have their peers rate them,

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,500
and you can have the people that are 
working for them,

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,693
rate them,
and it turns out that if you do that on 

49
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,390
a fairly regular basis,
say once every quarter or once every six

50
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,540
months or something like that,
and you use a standardized questionnaire

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,613
that you can,
that you can so that you can do 

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,273
quantitative analysis,
that you can get pretty reliable 

53
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,244
indicators of performance.
Now the problem of course is is just 

54
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,770
because your manager or the people that 
are working for you think you're doing a

55
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,530
good job.
Does that mean that the job you're doing

56
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,830
is adding anything to the actual 
productivity of the company?

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,340
And the answer to that is you don't 
know.

58
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,043
So I think to some degree that's why 
large companies tend to be somewhat 

59
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,580
unstable is once they get large enough,
there's a lot of inside to them.

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,950
It's not attached to the market in any 
way.

61
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,010
And so people can be working very hard,
but,

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
and,
and therefore productive from the 

63
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,970
perspective of actual,
you know,

64
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,804
labor input,
but whether or not that actually is 

65
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,084
producing a profit or producing the kind
of consequence that you'd want it to 

66
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,280
produce so that the company can keep 
going,

67
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,383
that's a completely different problem.
So even when you're trying to predict 

68
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,100
performance,
which is a fairly,

69
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,260
as I said,
a fairly real world phenomena,

70
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:18,160
you still have the problem of how it is 
that you measure performance.

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,233
So for example,
you guys are being graded all at the 

72
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,020
time and you might ask yourself,
well,

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,840
what are the,
what's the utility of those grades?

74
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,703
What do they accurately represent?
While you know they're going to be used 

75
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,163
in situations where you're trying to 
enter higher education and the CRA and 

76
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,630
the selection criteria are actually 
grades,

77
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,523
you know,
so if you want to go onto graduate 

78
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:43,360
school or to law school or to medicine 
or any of the professional schools,

79
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,630
then whether or not you get good grades 
actually matters,

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,913
but then the relationship between grades
and say achievement outside of those 

81
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,610
specific places where grades are 
necessary.

82
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,620
You might argue that that's less clear.
One thing we do know about the grades at

83
00:04:58,621 --> 00:04:59,454
the University of Toronto is that their,
their correlation with trait creativity 

84
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,264
is zero and so you know,
you might hope that one of the things 

85
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,490
that you'd be assessed for while you're 
in university would,

86
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,373
would be,
would have something to do with 

87
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,171
creativity,
right?

88
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,140
You're supposed to think originally and 
creatively and so on.

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,970
But our research so far when we've 
analyzed what's predicting grades at the

90
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,190
uft,
it's all ICU and conscientiousness.

91
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,420
So an introverts do slightly better but 
not a tremendous amount.

92
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,640
That's probably because they're not out 
partying all the time.

93
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,474
That would be my suspicion,
but openness apart from ICU has no 

94
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,544
relationship whatsoever and I think 
that's actually partly because it's not 

95
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,140
that easy.
First of all,

96
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,340
you're not going to get graded for being
creative on a multiple choice task,

97
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,560
right?

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,370
Because the last thing you want to be on
a multiple choice test is creative,

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,730
right?
So and then with regards to an essay,

100
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,564
well the problem with writing a creative
essay is in some sense you force the 

101
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:00,500
greater to come up with a scheme of 
grading that's sort of unique to you,

102
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,393
right?
Because if you've done something 

103
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:06,080
original and new and so it's not that 
easy for the person who's grading it.

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,183
You're forcing them to step outside of 
their comfortable rubric and of course 

105
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,074
that's a demand.
And when your Ta's or grading for 

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,414
example,
and they have 100 papers to grade the 

107
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:21,971
probability that on average they're 
going to appreciate a clear easy to read

108
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,960
an essay that does exactly what it was 
supposed to do is quite high rather than

109
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:27,794
something that's original and creative 
and that actually requires thought to 

110
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,710
understand.
Now,

111
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,613
you know,
I don't know if that's actually the 

112
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,304
problem,
although I suspect that it could well 

113
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:39,530
be,
but I do know that grades are not a good

114
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,840
marker of creativity,
so neither,

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,740
you know,
creative achievement per se.

116
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,680
So that's actually creative products 
that you've produced in your life.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,813
Neither that nor trade,
openness nor measures of creative 

118
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:52,964
thinking are associated with grades.
So I would say that the data sort of 

119
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:58,994
indicates that grades might be a good 
marker of managerial administrative 

120
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,030
ability,
but they're unlikely to be a good marker

121
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:10,031
of creative and entrepreneurial ability.
So anyways,

122
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,480
in any institution,
you know,

123
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,314
there's always a tension between the 
specific demands of the institution 

124
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:21,581
which are kind of orderly and set and 
then the requirement for creativity,

125
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,783
which is very difficult thing for an 
institution to deal with because 

126
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,060
institutions try to make thing things 
algorithmic so they can be predictable.

127
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,923
So I think that tension,
that tension is always there wherever 

128
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:37,010
you go in your life.
And that's also probably by why openness

129
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,740
and conscientiousness are actually not 
correlated,

130
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,270
right?
Because their,

131
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,643
their,
their responses to two really different 

132
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,070
forms of environments.

133
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,331
So.
Okay.

134
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:52,250
So predicting performance is difficult,
although it's useful because performance

135
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
exists and,
but assessing performance is also 

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,053
extremely difficult.
So that's why in some ways that's why 

137
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,230
you could regard market solutions to 
complex problems is almost inevitable.

138
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,663
Imagine that.
So how do you know if a company is run 

139
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,230
well?
Well,

140
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:15,740
the answer to that is people buy its 
products and they buy them for enough so

141
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,350
the company can keep running.
Then you might ask,

142
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,670
well,
is there anything that you could measure

143
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:24,671
outside of that and answer that is a 
possibly not because it's so difficult,

144
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,763
you know,
because I remember I read once that you 

145
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,250
know,
under the Communists,

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,450
uh,
there was uh,

147
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,670
there were central committees that had 
to do pricing.

148
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,810
And so this committee,
if I remember correctly,

149
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,980
had to make something on the order of 
100,000 pricing decisions a day.

150
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,010
So you can imagine,
you just try to think for a minute about

151
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,650
how you would calculate what a nail is 
worth.

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,473
Now remembered it.
You don't get any price data from the 

153
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,564
market because the market would say,
well a nail is worth whatever someone 

154
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,530
will pay for it.
While say you don't have a market,

155
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,543
well,
how in the hell do you figure out what 

156
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:00,844
it nails worth?
The answer to that is he can't because 

157
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,480
the nail is only worth something in 
relationship to every other thing that's

158
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,314
worth something.
So you could imagine trying to commute 

159
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:10,344
compute the comparative cost of one 
thing against all other things and then 

160
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,830
having to do that against all other 
things.

161
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,960
Well,
that's why

162
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,583
hypothetically,
that's why markets actually work 

163
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,164
efficiently is because you could think 
of the market as a gigantic 

164
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,303
supercomputer made up of the brains of 
every single person who's making 

165
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:34,120
purchasing decisions and you just don't 
even bother solving the problem.

166
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:37,930
You just throw things out there and some
of them succeed in the sort of Darwinian

167
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,150
way and some of them fail and that's 
that.

168
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:40,931
And you might say,
well,

169
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,940
the market,
you know there's.

170
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,163
There's problems with the way that the 
market values things and the proper 

171
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,890
response to that is yes,
no doubt,

172
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,130
but what are you going to do that might 
constitute a better alternative?

173
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:54,964
And then I'll tell you,
if you start wrestling with that 

174
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,480
problem,
it gets extraordinarily difficult.

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,600
It's just,
it's so technically complex that I don't

176
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,110
actually think it's manageable.
I think you can't do anything probably,

177
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,240
but make it worse.
Anyways.

178
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,503
So I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about the difference between pursuing a 

179
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:17,960
career in psychology and pursuing 
scientific truth.

180
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:18,794
I want to tell you about that because 
one of the things I've learned from 

181
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,394
trying to predict performance is that a 
whole lot of things that psychologists 

182
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:29,720
talk about research psychologists don't 
exist really at all.

183
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,160
And I'm not saying that because I'm 
cynical about psychology because

184
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,330
I think that any.

185
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,120
Yeah,

186
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,953
human venture has to produce a 
tremendous amount of waste and nonsense 

187
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:48,240
in order to produce any incremental 
knowledge whatsoever.

188
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,373
You know,
so like if you're thinking that every 

189
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,890
piece of research is going to produce 
new knowledge,

190
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,873
genuine knowledge,
then you're naive because there's lots 

191
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,350
of reasons why psychologists do research
and some of it is well because they have

192
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,184
to.
And some of it is because they have to 

193
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:04,284
train undergraduates and so 
undergraduates basically have to do bad 

194
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:07,494
research because well you only have four
months to do it and you're really going 

195
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,080
to discover something new and for months
it's like,

196
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:13,914
no.
And then master's students are kind of 

197
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,284
in the same situation is they're kind of
getting up and running and so they have 

198
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:23,610
to do some experiments and they have to 
be doable in the time that's allowed and

199
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:25,920
they don't know what they're doing and 
they don't know the statistics.

200
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,290
So of course they have to do bad 
research and then.

201
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,260
But they're,
they're being trained at least in how to

202
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,500
do it.
And like,

203
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,633
like most,
most human enterprises aren't very 

204
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,290
efficient.
So for example,

205
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,423
what do you guys think is,
what do you think's the average per 

206
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,843
percent of profit that a typical say 
North American Corporation makes over 

207
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:46,860
like a 50 year period?
If you averaged it,

208
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,630
what's a good rate of return?

209
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,890
Ten percent.
Anybody?

210
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
Twenty five.
Anybody else?

211
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,900
Three.
Anybody else?

212
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,053
Okay.
So three is the most accurate guests so 

213
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,230
far.
Now it's a little higher than that.

214
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,440
But not much,
and you can kind of tell that because

215
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
if business produced a higher rate of 
return than say three to seven percent,

216
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,810
no one would put their money in the 
bank.

217
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,120
They all put their money in the stock 
market,

218
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,500
right?
Because how much do you get right now?

219
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,050
If you put your money in the bank?
Nothing,

220
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:26,884
right?
One percent maybe if you're really 

221
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,534
lucky.
So obviously business has to produce 

222
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,950
more of return than that or everybody 
would put their money in the bank,

223
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,963
but it's not a tremendous amount more.
And so what that means is that for your 

224
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:40,120
typical corporation,
97 percent of what it does is,

225
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,020
is merely to keep itself running.
Only three percent.

226
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,420
Five percent is profit.
So why you,

227
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,270
why would you expect anything different 
in scientific research?

228
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,140
It's like 95 percent of it's probably 
rubbish,

229
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,483
but five percent is a lot.
When you think that there's tens of 

230
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,133
thousands of research papers being 
produced,

231
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,730
you know,
on a monthly basis.

232
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:02,890
So how fast do you want things to move 
forward?

233
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,203
To me in some sense,
I think they're moving forward fast 

234
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,221
enough,
right?

235
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,980
I mean,
it's already hard to keep up with things

236
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:09,814
like phones or anything electronic 
because they change so frequently that 

237
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,163
you know you have to continually force 
yourself to readapt so it's not even 

238
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,680
obvious how fast you want new knowledge 
to be generated.

239
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:24,130
So the reason I'm telling you all this 
is because I'm going to tell you a bunch

240
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,110
of things that I think psychologists do 
wrong,

241
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,123
but I'm not telling you that because I 
think psychologists do things 

242
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,064
particularly wrong.
It's that almost everything that people 

243
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,184
do is mostly just to keep things going 
and then there's this little frog 

244
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,233
fraction of the enterprise that might be
profit or it's equivalent in scientific 

245
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:41,734
endeavor,
which would be the generation of new 

246
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,360
knowledge.

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,090
And so you don't want to be.
You don't want to be cynical about that.

248
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,310
You need to know something about base 
rates,

249
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,260
you know,
when these sorts of things help you to.

250
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,270
If you do something like apply to 
graduate school.

251
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,280
So I'll,
I'll just talk to you very briefly about

252
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,114
that.
If you're going to apply to any place 

253
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,540
that had that where you have a low 
probability of getting in law school,

254
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,790
graduate school,
medical school,

255
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,720
business,
school,

256
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,010
some of what predicts whether or not you
get in as you grades,

257
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,170
letters of reference,
and your scores on the,

258
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,040
you know,
on the,

259
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,870
on the standardized tests.
Those are important.

260
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,560
Grades are the most important and then 
performance on the standardized tests.

261
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,783
But once you hit threshold,
so maybe you're like an a minus student 

262
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:25,540
and you do 70,
fifth percentile or above on the typical

263
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,590
standardized exam,
gre,

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,690
Ramcat,
cat or whatever it is.

265
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,763
Then what determines whether or not you 
get in our random factors so when you 

266
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:34,864
need to know that because all the time 
when you're trying to progress in your 

267
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,284
life,
some of whether or not you progress is 

268
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,600
going to be dependent on you.
Your intelligence and your diligence and

269
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,503
and perhaps your creativity and your 
emotional stability and other things 

270
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:48,544
that we've talked about.
But some of it is just the variation in 

271
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,510
the marketplace and it's random.
And so then the question is,

272
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,344
well,
how do you beat randomness in the 

273
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:55,964
marketplace?
An answer to that is by playing many 

274
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,740
different lotteries because it's all a 
lottery.

275
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,170
So if you want to go to clinical 
graduate school,

276
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,063
then you apply to 30 of them,
not two or three or 4:30 and there's 

277
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:09,944
about that many in Canada that are 
accredited now and there are schools in 

278
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,530
the us that you can apply to and that's 
hard.

279
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,520
Then it costs,
I think 50 to $75 a an application.

280
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,320
But that's trivial.
Like that's nothing,

281
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,060
that's an investment.
You don't worry about that.

282
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:26,120
You borrow for that if you have to.
And then you might say,

283
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,500
well I don't want to go to,
you know,

284
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:30,830
some little ratty town somewhere in 
northern Ontario say.

285
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,080
Or there's ratty little towns 
everywhere.

286
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
And the answer to that is,
well,

287
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,950
you can always say no when they accept 
you,

288
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,160
right?
So maybe you'll get lucky and you'll get

289
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:43,850
to go to somewhere you want to go or you
think you want to go and find,

290
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,100
go there.
But maybe you won't get so lucky,

291
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,010
but someone will offer you a place at a 
smaller institution.

292
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,443
Well then you have to think,
are you sure that there's not more 

293
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,530
opportunity at that smaller institution 
then you can make use of.

294
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,780
And the answer to that is yeah,
there is.

295
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,823
So for example,
where are you going to get a research 

296
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:06,350
degree is nowhere near as important as 
whether or not you go.

297
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,423
So the difference between no degree and 
a degree is way bigger than the 

298
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,950
difference between where you got your 
degree.

299
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,100
So if you're going,
this is the same with applying for jobs.

300
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:16,934
Like one of the things you might realize
is that the return on a CV is probably 

301
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,364
two percent if that.
So you can figure 25 applications for 

302
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,714
one interview and then maybe one out of 
three interviews or one out of four 

303
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:32,420
interviews is going to get you a job.
So.

304
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:35,390
And you need to know that because 
otherwise when you're applying for jobs,

305
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,730
you're going to get old disappointed 
because you're going to think,

306
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,940
well Jesus,
I've sent out like 30 job applications.

307
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,950
I haven't got one response.
You know,

308
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,843
there must be something wrong with the 
job environment or there must be 

309
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,700
something wrong with me.

310
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
It's like,
well no,

311
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,363
there might be something wrong with you 
and there might be something wrong with 

312
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:54,770
the job environment,
but you need to keep baselines in mind.

313
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,030
It's a low probability event and so then
what you have to do when you're applying

314
00:16:59,031 --> 00:16:59,864
for a job is like apply for two hours a 
day and assume you're going to do that 

315
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,120
for six months and don't burn yourself 
out and don't get depressed or oppressed

316
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:08,954
by the fact that it's extremely 
difficult because it is extremely 

317
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,760
difficult.
So it isn't.

318
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,720
It isn't a commentary on you or it.
It's not a commentary on society.

319
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,730
It's just that it's a low base rate 
phenomena.

320
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,400
Lots of jobs that are posted aren't 
really.

321
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,234
They don't even exist.
The companies are just trying to keep a 

322
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,620
turnover of hot resumes.
Some of them are.

323
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,180
They've already picked a candidate,
lots of places,

324
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,080
but they have to advertise by law,
you know,

325
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,950
so there's a whole bunch of reasons why 
you're not going to get called back.

326
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,650
It's not the right day when they pick up
your resume,

327
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,590
they've been flooded with resumes.
There's all sorts of reasons.

328
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:44,930
So anyways,
baselines matter.

329
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,420
So back to psychologist.
What is psychologists do?

330
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,770
Well,
they do two things.

331
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,350
Hopefully they have to do both of these 
to be successful.

332
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:55,950
They have to pursue scientific truth and
they have to pursue careers.

333
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,113
Now the problem is is that pursuing a 
career in pursuing scientific truth are 

334
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,444
not the same thing and so primarily 
people focus on pursuing their career 

335
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,880
and secondarily on scientific truth and 
maybe it has to be that way,

336
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,250
that way it's possible that it has to be
that way,

337
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,653
but that's not so good.
It's better to pursue scientific truth 

338
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,193
and then do what you can for your career
along the way because otherwise you end 

339
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,584
up chasing things that don't exist for 
your whole life and polluting the 

340
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:22,884
scientific literature with nonsense and 
that can have pretty bad personal and 

341
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,384
also social consequences because you can
end up discovering things that don't 

342
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,344
exist and then policy makers will make 
educational policy say on the basis of 

343
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:38,640
those recommendations and then that's 
not good and that happens a lot.

344
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,630
So here's how you pursue scientific 
truth.

345
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,560
Well,
the first thing,

346
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,360
and I'm not saying this is the only way 
of defining reality,

347
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,273
you know,
we've talked about the phenomenologists 

348
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,104
for example,
and the phenomenologists talk about 

349
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,230
reality as lived,
right?

350
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,840
So it's reality that encompasses your 
entire experience,

351
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,070
emotions,
motivations,

352
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,904
dreams,
all the things that are subjective plus 

353
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,320
the objective world that isn't how it 
works in science.

354
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,543
There's a rule in science and one of 
them is if you're phenomena can't be 

355
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:12,720
defined well enough to measure it,
then it doesn't exist scientifically.

356
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,823
And so that's the first rule.
You have to come up with a measurement 

357
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,690
tool for your concept.
So,

358
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,060
and I'll tell you why that's important a
little bit later.

359
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,733
Then you have to take your measurement 
and you have to see if it measures what 

360
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,264
it's supposed to measure.
And that's a very tricky thing because 

361
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,100
you have to figure out,
well what is it supposed to measure?

362
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,860
So let's say you come up with a measure 
of anxiety,

363
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,070
okay,
well a,

364
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,380
what's the measure?
And B,

365
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,900
what's it supposed to predict?
Exactly.

366
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,430
A heart rate increase.
Say,

367
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,481
well,
no.

368
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,314
Sometimes people's heart rate decrease 
when they get anxiety and sometimes 

369
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,030
people's heart rate increases because 
they're excited.

370
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,330
So skin conductance increase.
Well,

371
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,293
same problem.
Their skin conductance tends to rise 

372
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,390
generally whenever you're putting any 
sort of motivated state,

373
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,224
well self report,
well that's not so bad except maybe 

374
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,304
people aren't that good at 
distinguishing between guilt and shame 

375
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,064
and disgust and anxiety and emotional 
pain and frustration and disappointment 

376
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,190
assuming that those things are actually 
different.

377
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,473
So
it's a complicated problem to design a 

378
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,984
measure and then to determine whether it
measures anything and also to determine 

379
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:26,010
whether or not it measures what it's 
supposed to measure.

380
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:29,490
And you do that.
The rules are quite straightforward.

381
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,353
One is that you should be able to 
measure the phenomena of variety of 

382
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,040
using a variety of different methods,
so then you get into the problem of what

383
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,230
constitutes different,
but you can think about it,

384
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,153
the analogy of your senses.
You have five senses and if all five of 

385
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,220
them telling you that something there,
something is there,

386
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,603
the probability that it's there is quite
high and that's why we all managed to 

387
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:53,734
live right?
Once you get five different reporting 

388
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:56,824
systems telling you the same thing,
the probability that it's not there or 

389
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,380
that you're wrong starts to become 
vanishingly small.

390
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,480
So you sort of have to do that with your
measure.

391
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,463
So maybe it'd be a physiological measure
and a conceptual measure in a self 

392
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:11,020
report measure and an observational 
measure and a behavioral measure.

393
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,750
If you can get all of that and it 
converges,

394
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,460
you know,
all the measures correlate,

395
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,294
then you might think,
well there's something actually there 

396
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,903
and then you know,
you might also want to target something 

397
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,140
in the real world to predict and that's 
criterion related validity.

398
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,960
So you have to see if your measurement 
is reliable,

399
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,180
measures the same thing more than once 
in a role,

400
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,613
whether it can be the phenomena can be 
detected in a variety of different ways 

401
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,910
and whether that actually predicts 
something that might be useful.

402
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,523
So I really liked the last one and I 
think that's when where psychologists 

403
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,160
like there's a lot of complaints about 
psychology as a field right now,

404
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:48,994
especially in social psychology.
There's been a lot of scandal in the 

405
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,510
general scientific literature including 
medical literature.

406
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,460
You know,
people have been,

407
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,820
there was a guy a while back,
unfortunately I can't remember his name,

408
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,293
he had a Greek last name.
He published a paper showing 

409
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,154
mathematically that on average the 
reports that were submitted say in 

410
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:13,810
medical journals had to be wrong.
They were too improbable.

411
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:15,910
He figured it out statistically,
you know.

412
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:16,744
And then there's been a recent attempt 
to replicate some of the most 

413
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:22,300
fundamental findings in psychology and 
you know,

414
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,540
there's been some success at that,
but there's been plenty of failure too.

415
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,823
So one of the things I think that is 
useful if you're thinking about a 

416
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,400
research career is to pick a hard 
target,

417
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,263
see if you can make progress on that 
because that's one of the things that 

418
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:39,680
puts constraints on your theorizing,
you know,

419
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:40,514
like what I try to do when I'm,
when I'm working out a concept I liked 

420
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,594
to find out,
you could probably figure that out from 

421
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:45,724
this course.
I like to see if there's like a solid 

422
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,740
theoretical basis.
So the philosophy is solid and I like to

423
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,560
see if there's a brain model that'd be 
kind of helpful.

424
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,010
I'd like it if it was derived from 
animal experimentation rather than human

425
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:57,844
because I think that's more valid.
I'd like to see if there's a 

426
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:03,160
pharmacological level of analysis,
if that supports it,

427
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,950
that'd be really good.
Some behaviors would be nice.

428
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,990
And then if there's self report data,
well all that's all to the good.

429
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,320
And if you get something that you could 
measure across all five of those levels,

430
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,570
I think I mentioned five,
then you kind of think,

431
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,490
oh man,
there's probably something there.

432
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,473
Anxiety is a good example of that 
because you can measure anxiety with 

433
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,510
quest self report questionnaires,
you can get behavioral observations,

434
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,344
you can measure psychophysiology.
There's really good animal experimental 

435
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,214
models.
Plus there's a pharmacology because we 

436
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,260
know for example,
that you can give people benzodiazepines

437
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:36,094
or alcohol or barbiturates and that 
dampens the response and there are the 

438
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,104
reverse of those.
Actually there are drugs you can take 

439
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,830
that make you more anxious that work on 
the same basic systems.

440
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,933
So you might think a lot of that's been 
Jeffrey Gray's work or the stuff he 

441
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:50,364
summarized.
You can kind of think there's something 

442
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,980
there and then there's the animal 
behavior and so forth.

443
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,230
That also is indicative of anxiety.

444
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,333
That's your triangulation is getting 
pretty complete by the time you have 

445
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:04,370
five separate sources of information all
pointing to the same direction.

446
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,070
So,
and you know,

447
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,640
you really gotta be skeptical if you're 
a scientist because the probability that

448
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,710
you're discovering something is very,
very low.

449
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,963
And so it's easy to,
especially with the statistics because 

450
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,453
you know,
you tend to think of statistics as a 

451
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,970
sort of little machine.
You'd dump in numbers at the top and you

452
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:25,010
crank it and outcomes knowledge at the 
bottom,

453
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,290
and it's like,
that's just not true at all.

454
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,363
Statistics.
Is it an exploratory technique 

455
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,960
fundamentally,
and you're making decisions all the time

456
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:37,070
about what constitutes a valid data.
So you know there's an outlier problem,

457
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:37,904
right?
So if you graph your data one dimension 

458
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,024
across another,
you'll see people who are way the hell 

459
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,540
out on the measurements for one reason 
or another,

460
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,823
but,
and then you don't know whether you 

461
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,594
should include them in the analysis,
which is deadly if it's a regression 

462
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,143
analysis because it's really sensitive 
to outliers or whether you should toss 

463
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:54,584
them out,
but then there's the problem if you 

464
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:56,774
tossed them out,
then maybe that makes it easier for you 

465
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,810
to prove your hypothesis.

466
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,540
You know,
and you want to do that because you want

467
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,220
results because then you can publish 
them.

468
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,090
So like it's a really tricky business.
It's an,

469
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,720
it's an ethical business all the way 
because you have to make these decisions

470
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:15,140
that depend on your judgment.
And then you've got to ask yourself,

471
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,510
well,
when is your judgment valid?

472
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,493
And as far as I can tell,
the only answer to that is when you 

473
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:23,510
actually know what you're aiming at.
And so for example,

474
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,220
if you're going to go into science as a 
career,

475
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:29,090
you kind of have to decide is it a 
career,

476
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,763
in which case the scientific element of 
it is subordinate or are you trying to 

477
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:34,784
find something out?
And building a career as a consequence 

478
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,100
of that.
And it's,

479
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,590
it's really good to walk through that 
consciously because you know,

480
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:44,630
when you think about the value 
hierarchies we've talked about before is

481
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,673
your value hierarchy determines the 
decisions that you make and if you're 

482
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,830
conflicted about whether it's career 
promotion or truth.

483
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,320
While career promotion is gonna win out 
because it's,

484
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,850
it's,
it's expedient,

485
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,790
there's a lot of pressure pushing on 
youtube,

486
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,883
like get results to get good results,
to get publishable results and to get 

487
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:02,534
lots of them.
And so that's a lot of pressure pushing 

488
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:09,050
you to produce data that's better than 
it.

489
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,093
That looks better than it is.
And I think these are all micro 

490
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,310
judgments to say the problem of handling
outliers as well.

491
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,033
Their rules,
like if somebody is three standard 

492
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,890
deviations below the mean and the 
particular measure,

493
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,050
well then you can throw them out because
they're an outlier,

494
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:27,740
but well what if there two point seven,
five standard deviations from the meat,

495
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,993
it's like and there's only one of them 
so they stick way out there or even two 

496
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,174
standard deviations.
It's like how do you know when to get 

497
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:35,684
rid of them and the answer is you have 
to use your judgment so that you're 

498
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,350
modeling the data in the best way 
possible and one of the ways that I sort

499
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,184
of protect myself against that and my 
students is I tell them to use their 

500
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,100
statistics destructively,
which means okay,

501
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,050
you got a result,
see if he can make it go away,

502
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,750
fiddle with the data till it goes away,
see how hard that was or can you get the

503
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,910
same result using three different 
approaches,

504
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,550
three different statistical approaches,
you know,

505
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,020
different cutoffs and so forth.

506
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,560
Can you,
if,

507
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,860
if you play with it multiple ways,
does your result only come out once?

508
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,250
If that's the case,
well maybe it's not there.

509
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,950
If you can make it go away,
maybe it's not there and you know,

510
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,770
that's hard on the students because I 
had one student in particular,

511
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:20,460
he must've done eight studies,
lot of them were replications.

512
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:23,430
He'd get a result and then we tried to 
replicate it and it wouldn't replicate.

513
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,883
And so,
you know,

514
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,763
he did that for like four years.
He never got anything that would 

515
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:28,224
replicate and he could've published 
because I couldn't let him publish 

516
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,310
before we replicated.

517
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,480
But well,

518
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,940
the problem with that is then you set up
these red herrings that people chase,

519
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,043
you know,
he'd chase it and other people would 

520
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,420
chase it and that can happen forever.

521
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,613
So

522
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,163
here's how you pursue a career.
This is the sort of the opposite to 

523
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,673
pursuing scientific truth and one is 
invent a scale or a construct or rename 

524
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:59,910
a scale that already exists,
refused to validate it,

525
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,773
so you don't actually test it against 
anything where it's a critical test and 

526
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:06,360
then correlate it with some other 
phenomena that maybe doesn't exist.

527
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,880
So I can tell you a couple of examples 
of that.

528
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,113
Um,

529
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,533
one of the most recently,
and I think most scandalously was a 

530
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:15,014
concept called grit.
So a woman whose name I can't remember 

531
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:19,094
at the moment,

532
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,103
um,

533
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,490
Duckworth,
I think that's her name,

534
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,490
I hope that's her name.
Anyways,

535
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,890
she,
she did some research at the,

536
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:30,050
uh,
west point,

537
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:30,884
which is the place where the Americans 
train their soldiers and she was trying 

538
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:36,740
to figure out what predicted their,
their achievement and what she found was

539
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,903
that there were questions in a 
questionnaire that she called Grit that 

540
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,500
predicted performance and this,
this was big news man,

541
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,620
like she got a macarthur genius grant 
for this work,

542
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:49,454
which is very rare thing to get.
And it was like headlines all over the 

543
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:54,320
place,
grant and now if you look at the federal

544
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:57,970
government's publications on improving 
education in the US,

545
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,521
it's like,
well,

546
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,580
we have to teach our children grit.
But if you look at her paper,

547
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:02,414
you find out that grit,
which is derived from a questionnaire 

548
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,800
and we already know the questionnaire 
rules,

549
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,270
right?
What's the questionnaire rule?

550
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,433
If it's a questionnaire,
then it measures one or more of the big 

551
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:16,820
five traits either well or badly.
That's the rule.

552
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,720
While her grit questionnaire correlated 
with conscientiousness,

553
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:23,390
like at about point seven five,
and she said,

554
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,310
well,
that only accounts for 50 percent of the

555
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:27,170
variance point seven,
five squared,

556
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,273
but as we know,
hopefully point seven five is an 

557
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,604
insanely high correlation.
It's like if you give someone a 

558
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,624
questionnaire once and then you give 
them the questionnaire again and you 

559
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,700
correlate their two scores,
unless it's a deadly good,

560
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,543
the test,
retest reliability is only going to be 

561
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,860
about point seven five,
and so what that meant was grit measures

562
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:51,160
conscientiousness and conscientiousness 
predicts performance.

563
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,190
Of course we already know that 
conscientiousness predicts performance,

564
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,580
so that's not at best.
That would be an incremental addition to

565
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:00,670
a literature that's already well 
established,

566
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,670
but hey,
who cares about that name?

567
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,504
It Grit

568
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,390
and then you know you.
Your career progresses rapidly,

569
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:10,610
especially if you're talking to people 
who are clueless,

570
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,713
but you wore the whole structure of the 
say the educational establishment 

571
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:17,990
because now they're all shorting out and
you asked about teaching students grit.

572
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,161
It's like,
first of all,

573
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:21,620
it doesn't exist because it's 
conscientiousness.

574
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,340
Second conscientiousness has a pretty 
vicious biological basis.

575
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,740
Third,
to the degree that it's malleable,

576
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,340
we don't know how to teach it.
No one.

577
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:32,174
I've never seen a study ever that showed
that it increased people's 

578
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:37,010
conscientiousness.
How do you do that?

579
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,910
I mean your parents tried to do that to 
you for like 18 years.

580
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,740
Did it work?
You know,

581
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,360
work harder,
you know,

582
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,130
be more diligent,
pay more attention,

583
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:48,140
don't waste so much time.
It's like,

584
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,850
well,
they probably spent,

585
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,613
I don't know,
half an hour a day on you trying to 

586
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:57,620
teach you that maybe it's like 150 hours
a year.

587
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,080
It's about 2100 hours over the course of
your life.

588
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:00,914
Assuming that they were that diligent.
So that's 2100 hours made you as 

589
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:04,904
conscientious as you are now.
Another 20 hours of training is really 

590
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:10,550
gonna make a difference.
It's like highly improbable.

591
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,560
So then I remember another study this 
was done by shelley Taylor and Taylor

592
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,163
was the proponent of positive illusions.
How many of you have heard about 

593
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:21,230
positive illusions?

594
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,390
Okay,
so what's a positive illusion?

595
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,173
Do you remember?

596
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,633
Perception?

597
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,493
Well,
she would've called it less than 

598
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,114
grandiose.
The theory fundamentally is that people 

599
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:38,834
buttress their self concepts with these 
sort of mild deceptions about how 

600
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:45,500
wonderful they are and she thinks that.
So for example,

601
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,334
she's,
she draws on data showing that if you 

602
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,840
ask,
well let's try this,

603
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,170
how many of you think you are above 
average drivers?

604
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,583
Really,
let's do this because I'd like to 

605
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,620
replicate the experiment.
How many of you think that,

606
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,183
okay,
one,

607
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,510
two,
three,

608
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:03,344
four,
five,

609
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,311
six,
seven,

610
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:05,630
eight,
nine,

611
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:06,464
10.
How many of you think your average 

612
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:09,740
drivers?
Okay,

613
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,300
one,
two,

614
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,500
three,
four,

615
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,000
five,
six,

616
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:14,781
seven,
eight,

617
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:15,770
nine,
10,

618
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,140
11,
12.

619
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,630
How many of you think you're below 
average drivers?

620
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,760
One,
two,

621
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,720
three,
four,

622
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:25,370
five,
six,

623
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,510
seven,
seven.

624
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,650
Is that your voter?
Hers.

625
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,780
Okay.
Okay.

626
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,763
So it looks.
So Taylor's hypothesis was that if you 

627
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,754
ask often undergraduates in particular 
if they think they're better than 

628
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,793
average drivers,
I think maybe this isn't self report 

629
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,100
rather than,
you know,

630
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,440
in an audience like this that most of 
them say they're above average.

631
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,483
Now you guys failed that.
So that was a non replication as far as 

632
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:49,844
I'm concerned because the mo about two 
thirds of you said you were either 

633
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,710
average or below average.

634
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,180
So,
but anyways,

635
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,450
hypothetically,
that evidence for this pervasive sort of

636
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,553
self aggrandizement in mild ways is 
quite high and people who are like that 

637
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:10,010
are happier.
Well

638
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,650
their wellbeing is better,
whatever wellbeing is.

639
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,723
So anyway,
she published this paper and there was 

640
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,770
in the Journal of personality and social
psychology and she took all these.

641
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,080
So you might say,
well what's the positive illusion?

642
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,030
And the answer to that is,
well,

643
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,830
who knows,
try defining it.

644
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,380
Well how much,
when does it become a lie?

645
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,460
Well,
if it's too big,

646
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,890
well exactly how big.
Exactly.

647
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:37,070
When is it an illusion and when is it a 
positive illusion?

648
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:39,680
When does that turn into like a 
deception in windows?

649
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:41,990
That turned into a lot.
It's like that's really hard to.

650
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,260
It's not hard to specify.
It's bloody impossible to specify.

651
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,810
And then exactly.
What do you mean by wellbeing?

652
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,123
Okay.
So what she did in this one paper was 

653
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:51,674
she took a bunch of measures that were 
hypothetically aligned in some way with 

654
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,340
positive illusions,
um,

655
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,970
and then she factor analyze them.

656
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,803
Okay.
And she took out the first factor and 

657
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:00,981
she said,
well,

658
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:03,410
that's a positive illusion factor.
Got that.

659
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,603
Okay.
Then she took a bunch of outcome 

660
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,164
measures which were like quantify 
psychiatric scales that purported to 

661
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,610
measure wellbeing and mental health,
and she factor analyze that and took out

662
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,444
the first factor.
And then she showed that the first 

663
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:16,904
factor from the predictors correlated 
with the first factor from the outcome 

664
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:21,464
measures of course,
whether it was an outcome measure 

665
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,700
predictor was,
you know,

666
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,990
just happened to be which call them,
you put them in.

667
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,093
But even worse,
if you take questionnaires and you 

668
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:30,794
factor analyze them,
the first factor is usually 

669
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,554
extroversion.
So basically what she did was factor 

670
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,840
analyze one group of questionnaires and 
go on extroversion,

671
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:42,140
which he called positive illusions.
And then she factor analyzed another set

672
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:45,590
of questionnaires and took out the first
factor and she called that psychological

673
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:46,400
wellbeing.

674
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,670
And then she showed the positive 
illusion predicted wellbeing.

675
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,670
Except what she really showed was that 
extroversion predicted extroversion,

676
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,490
which is to show nothing at all,
right,

677
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,130
but right,
but you got like,

678
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,973
you really got to watch this because you
got to assume that most of the 

679
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:03,830
psychological studies that you're 
reading are wrong in some important way,

680
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,330
and unfortunately you can only figure 
that out if you read the actual results,

681
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,164
which is actually very difficult.
You can't read the results in 10 

682
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:12,450
minutes.
Like you know,

683
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,303
it took somebody a whole year to do it.
You have to think through it and it's 

684
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:18,740
hard and you know like that,
that paper,

685
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,574
for example,
criticizing how to critique that is not 

686
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,064
obvious.
You have to know that if you take 

687
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,823
questionnaires that measure emotion,
roughly speaking or something akin to 

688
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:32,150
personality and you factor analyze them,
that's the first factor.

689
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,830
You're likely to pull out his 
extraversion.

690
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,723
If you didn't know that,
then you wouldn't know what sort of 

691
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,710
games were being played with the data.
So that happens all the time.

692
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,890
So here's some things.
Oh yes.

693
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,080
So then what do you do once you've got 
your little phenomena,

694
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,880
you publish it and then you get some 
other people who are interested in it.

695
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:51,714
So that's your little primate dominance 
hierarchy and you don't want too many 

696
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,254
people in that because then it's hard to
climb to the top but you don't want too 

697
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:00,180
few because if it's just you and some 
other jerk,

698
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,450
then you know
who cares about you.

699
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,930
So it has to be,
it has to be of moderate size,

700
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,764
right?
And then you use a bunch of jargon so 

701
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:09,894
that you can separate yourself from the 
criticisms of other people and then you 

702
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,034
compete with each other to climb up the 
hierarchy and it's a fairly small 

703
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:16,710
hierarchy.

704
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,430
So you have a pretty good chance of 
being like at least you know,

705
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,170
vice president or something like that.
Use your statistics selectively and then

706
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,013
enjoy the fruits of your success.
It's like it's a crummy way to go about 

707
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:28,854
it and it's dangerous.
It's dangerous because public policy 

708
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:35,670
people get jump all over this sort of 
stuff and then bad things happen.

709
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,923
So.
And they will tell you some stories 

710
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:42,090
about that.
So I told you already that psychologists

711
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:44,160
are having a hard time with replication.
It's like,

712
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:44,790
yeah,
yeah,

713
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,560
everybody has a hard time with 
replication,

714
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,753
but there's other problems to a.
because the damn journals won't publish 

715
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:53,490
replications.
So if you're going to publish something.

716
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,060
So we've done studies like seven studies
in a row,

717
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:57,894
say trying to replicate based on a 
finding that's hypothetically well 

718
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,584
established in psychology.
So we're using it as a measure and be 

719
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,370
damned if we can get it to work.

720
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,320
So we have like seven studies where it 
doesn't work.

721
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,680
So you think you could publish seven 
study saying you know what,

722
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,620
this thing that everybody thinks works,
it doesn't work.

723
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,160
You can't,
you can't publish non replications.

724
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,530
So that's a big problem.
You know,

725
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,170
the journals won't take them.
And so not only that,

726
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:25,590
the journals will rarely publish 
replications themselves,

727
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,424
even if they're successful because they 
don't contribute anything new to 

728
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,180
knowledge,
you know?

729
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,060
And so you can work yourself half to 
death and do a really good study,

730
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,800
you know,
and you find out,

731
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:35,910
oh this,
that didn't work.

732
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,703
And so maybe it took you two years,
like you're basically screwed because 

733
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,004
what are you going to do with that?
Put it in a drawer somewhere and you 

734
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,034
know,
maybe you're a bit wiser but it doesn't 

735
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,050
advance your career.
So that's a big problem.

736
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:49,884
So part of the problem with sciences 
that we forced scientists to only 

737
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,540
discover things,
you know,

738
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,080
and that's,
they don't get rewarded otherwise.

739
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,943
And so it's a big problem and it's not 
certainly not just psychologists that 

740
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,610
have.
So okay,

741
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,623
here's some things I think don't exist.
So if you're going to predict anything 

742
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,520
in the real world,
here's some things not to use.

743
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,950
I don't think self esteem exists is 
wrote really one scale.

744
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,020
The Roman taffer automated self esteem 
scale,

745
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:19,854
that's pretty good.
But the standard one is the Rosenberg 

746
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:24,720
and I can't remember how many items it 
has.

747
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,080
15 or something.
Not enough items to be,

748
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:28,950
to be reliable.
I think there were,

749
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,803
yeah,
25,000 published papers on self esteem 

750
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,210
figure 10 grand to paper,
which is a true,

751
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,420
you know,
comparatively conservative estimation.

752
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,120
So you can do the math 25,000 times 
10,000.

753
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,290
So that's the total amount of research 
funding that's gone into looking at self

754
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,160
esteem.
It's like,

755
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,250
well what self esteem,
it's a word actually,

756
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,180
it's two words,
right?

757
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,560
But you know,
and,

758
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,200
and it's sort of something you think you
might have or not have,

759
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,620
but,
but that's a figure of speech that's not

760
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:59,410
an empirical phenomena.
And so most of your artists,

761
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,363
most of extroversion,
most of extroversion is just 

762
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,310
neuroticism.
As it turns out,

763
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,740
it's like if you have a lot of negative 
emotion,

764
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,280
you don't feel that good about yourself.
Well isn't that a surprise?

765
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,770
You have a lot of negative emotion,
you know,

766
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,480
and if you want to fix it up a little 
bit,

767
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,314
then you can also subtract positive 
emotion from that because if you have a 

768
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,410
lot of negative emotion and you don't 
have a lot of positive emotion,

769
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,180
so that's neuroticism minus 
extroversion,

770
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,110
then your self esteem is even lower,
you know?

771
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,953
And then maybe over time 
conscientiousness starts to make a bit 

772
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,721
of a difference,
right?

773
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,030
Because if you're conscientious and you 
work hard,

774
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:34,780
you can start to see that that's paying 
off and calf rod has done some work that

775
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,760
seems to sort of indicate that.

776
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,743
But you know,
the first thing that happened is 

777
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,014
everybody went on a self esteem bander 
even though the measures were pretty 

778
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:47,350
appalling and even though you could 
model it with the big five,

779
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,184
and then one of the things that happened
as a consequence of that was that the 

780
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,980
whole California school system started 
to teach students self esteem.

781
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,173
It's like a,
what makes you think you should have 

782
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:58,444
high self esteem?
Like maybe you're a miserable little 

783
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,480
worm.
God only knows,

784
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,850
right?
It's not the case that you should have a

785
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,280
good opinion of yourself in every bloody
situation.

786
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,443
You know what?
If you're a bully who pounds people out 

787
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,424
in the schoolyard,
bullies by the way do have higher self 

788
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:12,604
esteem than normal.
So there because it's not like they're 

789
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,320
feeling bad about themselves when they 
pound you,

790
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,200
they're feeling bad about you and the 
best work.

791
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,183
You know,
the low self esteem equals bully 

792
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,850
hypothesis.
Lots of people believe that,

793
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:25,684
but if you read Dan always,
who's the world's leading authority on 

794
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:30,040
bullying and who's actually done 
something about it,

795
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,570
what he says is that bullies have 
inappropriately high self esteem,

796
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,450
which is why they think they're in a 
perfectly good position to pound you out

797
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:38,284
if you happen to be on the playground.
So it's not like they're suffering from 

798
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:41,590
an,
you know,

799
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,160
neurotic weakness of self image.
It's quite the contrary.

800
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,360
So anyways,
in the California school system,

801
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,390
they tried to teach kids self esteem and
you know,

802
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,224
there's no evidence that you can do that
first because neuroticism is actually 

803
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,970
quite hard to shift.
So.

804
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,210
And if we knew how to treat it well,
hooray,

805
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,770
everybody would be thrilled about that.
But it's not easy.

806
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,280
And second,
there are people like,

807
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:06,880
uh,
what's her name,

808
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,313
Jean,
when she used to be a student of Roy 

809
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,553
ministers who claims that all that self 
esteem training has just made younger 

810
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,590
people like you guys more.

811
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,950
What do you call that?
Narcissistic.

812
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,083
Yeah.
Because the self esteem becomes 

813
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,870
disconnected from the actual 
accomplishment because you might hope,

814
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,400
well,
you'd sort of feel good.

815
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,600
How good should you feel about yourself?
Well,

816
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,411
you know,
you might say,

817
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:33,244
well,
you should grant yourself the right to 

818
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:36,080
exist like you do.
Everyone else,

819
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,690
you know that sort of like a basic human
right as a human being,

820
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:39,524
you're valuable and then maybe you 
should sort of think you're about as 

821
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,300
valuable as other people roughly think 
you are.

822
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,860
That seems about right,
right?

823
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:46,694
So the right amount of self esteem would
be your perception of your value within 

824
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,440
the context of a group.
It's got to be something like that,

825
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,533
you know,
so there shouldn't be a concordance 

826
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,450
because like maybe you need to improve.
Could well be,

827
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,673
you know,
and are you going to improve if you're 

828
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,530
feeling really good about yourself?

829
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,440
Well the answer to that is what we don't
know.

830
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,113
How much misery about yourself do you 
have to have before you're motivated to 

831
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,260
improve yourself?
Not.

832
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,750
Well,
that doesn't seem right,

833
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:19,000
but we also don't know whether it's 
shame or guilt or anxiety or pain or you

834
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:19,834
know,
these negative emotions that motivate 

835
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:21,734
you.
Now it's clear that if you have enough 

836
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:27,320
negative emotion that can paralyze you,
but that's like depression and and,

837
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,213
and you know,
psychiatrically high levels of anxiety 

838
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:33,350
that's not like low self esteem,
so that's a problem.

839
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,393
I don't believe that working memory and 
executive function are distinguishable 

840
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:38,720
from ICU,
especially.

841
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,790
Gee,
our research,

842
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,640
we've done a lot of it.
I've added factor,

843
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,483
analyzed a battery of 10 dorsolateral 
prefrontal tests done given to 3000 

844
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:52,790
people.
It's a big,

845
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,623
very big sample.
We haven't published this for a variety 

846
00:42:56,631 --> 00:42:59,610
of reasons,
but one factor comes out and you know,

847
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:03,470
and Carol's rule for Iq,
as you take cognitive tests,

848
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:06,050
a bunch of them,
you fact around analyze them,

849
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,130
you pull out the first factor.

850
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,570
That's fluid intelligence.
It's like,

851
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:09,404
well that's basically what we found.
And so if you look at the correlation 

852
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:15,410
between each of the single tests and the
first factor,

853
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:17,120
it's only about point three or point 
four,

854
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,550
but that's also what you find in Iq 
tests.

855
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,803
You know,
each individual test only correlates 

856
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:26,060
with the aggregate at about point three.
But if you aggregate enough of them,

857
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,450
you get fluid intelligence and it's just
a solid as a rock.

858
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,613
So I'm emotional intelligence.
Not only does that probably not exist 

859
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,850
because it's agreeableness,
it,

860
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,930
you know,
how you always hear,

861
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:42,020
you need emotional intelligence to,
to thrive in the workplace.

862
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,360
It's like turns out that's exactly 
backwards.

863
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,260
Disagreeable people do better as 
managers in the workplace.

864
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,140
So it's actually,
if you lack emotional intelligence,

865
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:53,450
you're more likely to be an effective 
manager.

866
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,643
So an emotional intelligence is a great
indicator of sort of pathology and 

867
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,090
psychology because it was invented by a 
journalist,

868
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,573
you know,
you can't just have some word invented 

869
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,980
by a journalist and then go make a whole
bloody,

870
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,260
you know,
enterprise out of it.

871
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,183
You got to find out if it,
if it's really there and there's not a 

872
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:15,140
lot of evidence that it is.
And what does it mean anyways?

873
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,340
Emotional intelligence.
What does that mean?

874
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,210
I can infer what you're feeling.
Well,

875
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,140
is that Iq like our smart people better 
at that or like,

876
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,200
am I mirroring you in some way or do I 
care for you?

877
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,034
Like maybe I can figure out exactly what
you're feeling and I just don't give a 

878
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:34,080
damn,
you know,

879
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,290
is that still emotional intelligence?
While I don't know.

880
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,124
Right.
How would you separate that from 

881
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:39,774
sympathy or empathy and what and what if
you're over sympathetic to someone is 

882
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:46,620
that emotional intelligence?
Like maybe you'll feel way too sorry for

883
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:47,454
your children.
So it's like you're all empathetic and 

884
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:50,454
all that,
but you're not doing them any good or 

885
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,030
sometimes you would be,
but sometimes you should say,

886
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:54,930
you know,
quit whining,

887
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:58,530
go the hell outside because that's the 
right response sometimes.

888
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,210
So these things are not straightforward 
at all.

889
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,523
And of course emotional intelligence is 
generally measured with questionnaires 

890
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,400
and we know the rule for questionnaires.
What's the rule for questionnaires?

891
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,040
That's right,
exactly.

892
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,270
It's measuring one or more of the big 
five either well or badly.

893
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,570
Okay.
So and,

894
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:23,404
and as far as I can tell,
that doesn't mean that personality as a 

895
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,010
five dimensional structure.
I'm not making that argument because who

896
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,530
the hell knows?
I don't think it does likely,

897
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,053
although it's very difficult to say,
but what the big five theorists have 

898
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,920
really demonstrated as far as I'm 
concerned,

899
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,990
is that if you factor headlights,
questionnaires,

900
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,063
what you get looks a lot like a five 
factor structure and you can do that 

901
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:44,694
cross culturally and so I think we sort 
of nailed the question of how our 

902
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:53,100
questionnaire is structured so you can't
just invent some new thing in term.

903
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:57,780
It's something and then pretend it 
something new without testing it against

904
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:00,180
and I would test it against Iq because 
that bloody thing.

905
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,163
We know for example,
Iq eats up most of the variance in 

906
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:03,390
disgust.

907
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,640
Sensitivity scales.
You would think,

908
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:06,450
well,
why?

909
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,120
Why would I qb related to disgust 
sensitivity.

910
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:10,770
It's inversely related.
By the way,

911
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,340
the smarter you are,
the less sensitive you are to discuss.

912
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:15,803
Now I don't know if that's because maybe
your cortical inhibition of underlying 

913
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,740
like limbic limbic motivational systems 
is better.

914
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,200
Who the hell knows?
We don't know why,

915
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,060
but we do know that it's a major 
predictor.

916
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:27,894
Orderliness also predicts,
but the thing about Iq is that it 

917
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,254
predicts things that you'd never expect,
so you should validate your scale 

918
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:35,034
against Iq and against the big five and 
not some trivial little 10 item measure 

919
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:43,050
of the big five either because then if 
you use two questions per trade,

920
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:43,884
you're going to have a lousy measure of 
the big five and if you're stupid 

921
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,940
questionnaire predicts over and above 
that,

922
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:50,670
all that means is that you didn't test 
it against you.

923
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,503
No,
you didn't set it up for a good 

924
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:54,120
challenge.
You set it up for a week challenge.

925
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,480
So grant,
that's very annoying.

926
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,703
Yes,
that's very annoying because it's 

927
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,140
clearly.
I think it was correlated.

928
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:04,410
I think I told you this was correlated 
with conscientiousness of point seven,

929
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,244
five.
I don't believe that optimism and 

930
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:07,104
pessimism exist.
I don't believe that promotion and 

931
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:11,820
prevention exist.
Empathy.

932
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,830
We tried measuring empathy.
It's like we use.

933
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,740
You can measure empathy like mad if you 
use one measure,

934
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,293
but he was three.
Then all of a sudden your empathy 

935
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:21,840
measures don't correlate,
so that really sucks.

936
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,180
So the way out of that is just to use 
one measure,

937
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:25,014
right?
Well obviously not if you're three 

938
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:30,940
empathy measures don't correlate while 
you got a problem.

939
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,133
It's like you have three rulers and you 
measure something and you get different 

940
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:36,400
numbers from each.
It's like really?

941
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,420
That's probably you're either measuring 
like bubblegum,

942
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,940
well it stretching or there's something 
wrong with your rulers.

943
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,283
So I don't think psychopathy exists.
I think it's low agreeableness and low 

944
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,004
conscientiousness because that would 
make you a Predator that's low 

945
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,450
agreeableness and a parasite because 
that's low conscientiousness.

946
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,400
So that kind of sums up psychopaths in 
terms of personality disorders.

947
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,083
There was a bunch of them and you know 
over the last 20 years people have been 

948
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,553
the psychometricians in particular.
I'd be trying to cram those things into 

949
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,360
the big five structure and they're 
reaching,

950
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,763
they're experiencing a tremendous amount
of resistance from the established 

951
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:20,431
psychiatric community and no wonder but 
the but it still lift big five does seem

952
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:21,784
to be able to provide a pretty good 
model of what constitutes personality 

953
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:25,414
pathology.
And that's kind of surprising because 

954
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:31,060
you may remember I told you when,
when the personality measures were first

955
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,043
originated,
they threw out all the evaluative words 

956
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,530
like evil or bad or,
or good for that matter,

957
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:39,364
and you know,
you could imagine that that would 

958
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,524
attenuate the relationship between 
personality and psychopathology because 

959
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,453
you tend to use more anti,
more judgmental words when you're 

960
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,810
describing psychopathology,
like antisocial for example,

961
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,580
which isn't in a personality 
questionnaire,

962
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:55,414
but which if it was,
would likely load primarily on low on 

963
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,000
agreeableness,
low

964
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,490
positive illusions told you about that 
already practical intelligence.

965
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,383
It's like,
no,

966
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,140
that does not exist and there's no 
evidence that it exists.

967
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:11,974
So Sternberg who has said that part of 
the reason he was interested in 

968
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,000
practical intelligence was because he 
didn't do very well on his gres.

969
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,920
So,
um,

970
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,510
you know,
he's got this idea that,

971
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,430
well there's a difference between book 
smarts and that sort of nerdy people and

972
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,323
like,
you know,

973
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,830
street smarts,
which is like,

974
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:30,664
I don't know,
the punk who makes it out in the real 

975
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,040
world,
something like that.

976
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,930
And Street smarts is like practical 
intelligence with.

977
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:37,764
The problem is is that he never really 
puts his practical intelligence 

978
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,253
measures,
which really don't exist up against Iq 

979
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,733
in a fair head to head fight and he's 
being just slaughtered for this in the 

980
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,810
scientific press,
especially by Linda.

981
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:53,260
God Fredson who wrote that paper that I 
had you guys read on,

982
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,210
you know,
the complexity of everyday life.

983
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,640
God's since she's a smart cookie,
that woman,

984
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,230
and she's brave too,
you know,

985
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,290
because she follows the data where it 
goes and she's a very,

986
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,860
very clear thinker.
She really gave Sternberg couple of good

987
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,010
wax and he certainly deserved it.
Multiple intelligences.

988
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:10,600
You've heard about that.
I've imagined.

989
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,300
What are they?
Sensory Motor.

990
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,670
Kinesthetic,
emotional.

991
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,280
I don't remember.
What's that?

992
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,470
Interpersonal.
Yeah.

993
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,270
Yeah.
Those aren't intelligences.

994
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,660
First of all,
a who knows if they exist and be.

995
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,160
We had a perfectly good word for them,
which was talent.

996
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,750
It's like you can't just take a word,
you know,

997
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,260
like that's been studied for 100 years,
like intelligence,

998
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:35,120
which has a very,
very specific,

999
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,413
a specific definition,
more specific than anything social 

1000
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:40,820
scientists measure.
Right?

1001
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:42,800
So if you believe in social science at 
all,

1002
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,070
you have to take Iq into account.
He just swipes the word says,

1003
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,050
oh,
well everybody wins.

1004
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,011
You know?
It's like,

1005
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:49,844
yeah,
yeah,

1006
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,400
people have talents,
fair enough,

1007
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:53,840
you know,
and they're not trivial.

1008
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,410
But to call them intelligences.
And then he also says,

1009
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,630
when people harass him about his 
concepts,

1010
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:00,051
he says,
well,

1011
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:02,390
I don't really believe in measurement.
It's like,

1012
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:03,680
okay,
okay,

1013
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:06,150
that's fine.
Except if you're like,

1014
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,150
if you're not going to believe in 
measurement,

1015
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,480
then what are you doing?
It's not science.

1016
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,160
It might be,
I don't know what it is.

1017
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,770
Maybe it's educational philosophy or 
something like that,

1018
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,143
but it's not science.
And so it's 20 years later with his 

1019
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:21,044
multiple intelligence theories and 
there's be no published measures of 

1020
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:24,584
them.
And whenever people have tried to 

1021
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,624
measure them and set them up head to 
head against say intelligence plus 

1022
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,450
personality intelligence and personality
just eats them up.

1023
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,530
And so,
you know,

1024
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,950
multiple intelligence theory had a big 
effect on educational theory.

1025
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,150
You know,
it's like,

1026
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,983
well,
every child should have the opportunity 

1027
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:42,230
to develop their own particular form of 
intelligence.

1028
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:42,681
It's like,
yeah,

1029
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,750
well that's great except you can't 
measure it.

1030
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,970
We don't know if it exists and even if 
it does,

1031
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,853
we don't know how to develop it and you 
haven't shown that you can develop it 

1032
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,150
and you haven't shown that you're not 
doing harm by,

1033
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,103
you know,
pretending that these things exist and 

1034
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,070
act as if that's actual knowledge.
So

1035
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,370
things that might exist.
Well,

1036
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,160
I told you about these already while 
there's lots,

1037
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,183
you know,
I talked to you a lot about the big 

1038
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,864
five,
you know,

1039
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,823
but personality isn't that great.
A predictor of individual behavior 

1040
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:10,724
because people are very variable in 
their behavior from situation to 

1041
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:13,574
situation.
So the best you ever get out of a 

1042
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:18,050
personality measures about point three 
or maybe about point four,

1043
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,440
that was discovered in 1968.

1044
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:26,710
There was a big hubbub about that made 
by Walter Michelle who said,

1045
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:29,480
well,
personality scales,

1046
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:32,360
they give you a point to point three.
That's like nine percent of the variance

1047
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,194
at best.
So what about the other 90 percent and 

1048
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:39,590
why are we chasing such a trivial amount
and that killed personality research,

1049
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:42,980
Stone Dad,
four til 1992.

1050
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,143
So for 20,
that's 24 years I believe because 

1051
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,090
everybody went,
oh yeah,

1052
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:47,924
these are trivial effects,
but then no one ever looked to see what 

1053
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,074
the effects were in all the rest of 
psychology because it turned out that 

1054
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:56,780
point two,
point three is about on the upper end of

1055
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:57,614
the effects that you get in most forms 
of psychology and so that even if it 

1056
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,270
isn't that great,
it's as good or better than whatever one

1057
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,203
else is doing.
And so then there are also economic 

1058
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:08,924
analysis which we'll show you later done
in the 19 nineties that showed that 

1059
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,800
because human variability in 
productivity is so great,

1060
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:16,903
especially on the Prieto distribution,
that you don't need very accurate 

1061
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,630
predictors for them to be extremely 
useful economically.

1062
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,200
Because the question might be,
you know,

1063
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,460
like,
so you're paying your employee $50,000 a

1064
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:33,270
year and you can,
you could potentially pick an employee,

1065
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,163
an employee that was one standard 
deviation above the mean higher than 

1066
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:41,520
average on conscientiousness.
So with some bad measure,

1067
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,383
you know,
so over 10 employees you get an average 

1068
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:46,500
of one standard deviation higher,
something like that.

1069
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,070
The real question is,
well,

1070
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,960
what's the economic return on that?
And the answer is well,

1071
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:52,794
because people are so variable in their 
performance when some people do like 

1072
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,260
their crazily productive and others are 
like,

1073
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,333
they actually detract from the function 
of the organization that they figure 

1074
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:03,174
about 40 percent of managers,
ab negative net value to the companies 

1075
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:07,434
they work for.
So it's like the productivity line 

1076
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,730
doesn't end.
It's zero.

1077
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,400
It's like if you're a particularly bad 
manager,

1078
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,860
you can be sucking money out of the 
enterprise like Matt.

1079
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,790
Well it turns out that even small 
predictors have huge economic value.

1080
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,040
So even though they're not that good,

1081
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,150
the amount that they are good is better 
than interviews for example,

1082
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:28,984
by quite a substantial margin.
And so if you're gonna hire people and 

1083
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:32,674
you want better people,
then you can use personality tests and 

1084
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:37,080
that that actually works.
So what,

1085
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,370
what's real well,
cultural factors are real.

1086
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,610
The,
the effects of your peer networks,

1087
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:43,444
that's real.
The degree to which like one thing you 

1088
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:50,080
guys should think about as you progress 
through life is that,

1089
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,933
you know,
there's a variety of things that make 

1090
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:54,310
you successful.
Intelligence is one,

1091
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:57,010
intelligence is another.
Those are pretty rough.

1092
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,290
The breadth of your social network,
that's a big deal too.

1093
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,880
That's something to think about.
You know,

1094
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,720
people talk about,
I hate this word schmoozing,

1095
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,803
it's a horrible word and I wouldn't 
recommend that anybody ever does that 

1096
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:14,110
because that's sort of making 
connections for the sake of having them.

1097
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:14,944
But you know,
as you get older you'll find that of 

1098
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,303
course the people that you know get 
older too and they get centralized and 

1099
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:25,750
more and more in positions with more and
more influence.

1100
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:26,883
And so what that means is that one of 
the things that makes you valuable as 

1101
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:34,411
you get older is how well connected you 
are in a sort of broad social network.

1102
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:38,200
Because a lot of what happens if someone
comes to you and says,

1103
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,850
well,
here I've got a problem.

1104
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,090
I mean one potential response to that as
well,

1105
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:45,670
all solve it,
and another potential response is,

1106
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,170
well,
I don't know how to solve that,

1107
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:50,860
but I know this guy or this woman,
and they do know how to solve it,

1108
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,290
so you know that that's an extremely 
useful.

1109
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,880
That's an extremely useful additional 
attribute and we haven't measured that.

1110
00:55:57,881 --> 00:55:59,140
We don't.
We have measured that much.

1111
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:02,170
I think it's one of the things that give
older people in edge on younger people.

1112
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,410
Younger people are smarter in terms of 
fluid intelligence.

1113
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:06,244
They're not as conscientious though when
their social networks are nowhere near 

1114
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:09,844
as well developed.
I put that slide together about a year 

1115
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,100
ago.
It's kind of an interesting one.

1116
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,240
I think you can see just from the facial
expressions,

1117
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:22,330
were these people sort of map pay while 
Jim Carey,

1118
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,160
you could hardly get extroverted than 
him.

1119
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,640
It's like he's on cocaine all the time.
Mr Rogers,

1120
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,170
he's agreeable.
You wouldn't know the next guy.

1121
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,004
His name was able to go to a played.
He played a very introverted policemen 

1122
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,274
on an old sitcom.
What do and while he's neurotic is can 

1123
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:45,430
be a castle high in openness.
Jimmy Stewart,

1124
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,020
very high in emotional stability house.
What's houses primary characteristic?

1125
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,660
Disagreeable.
He's really disagreeable.

1126
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,010
He's very,
very intelligent,

1127
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,540
right?
But he's super disagreeable.

1128
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,370
So.
But that's what makes him interesting.

1129
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:02,600
Robert mentioned was the same then.
I'm Clint Eastwood,

1130
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,570
disagreeable,
introverted and emotionally stable.

1131
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,580
Right?
So

1132
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,420
it's quite interesting to see how varied
the facial expressions are.

1133
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,940
So you guys of course remember this will
just take a look at it briefly,

1134
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:21,800
so to,
to clue you in.

1135
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:24,650
So the big predictor seemed to be 
industriousness,

1136
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,990
emotional stability,
agreeableness.

1137
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:27,824
If you're working with people and 
disagreeableness if you're working with 

1138
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:30,614
things and plasticity,
openness gives you creative achievement 

1139
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:37,100
plus entrepreneurial ability and 
extroversion is pretty good.

1140
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,120
We just published a paper using the 
creative achievement questionnaire,

1141
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:41,954
which I'll show you a bit later and what
we found was that openness was a very 

1142
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:48,530
good predictor of,
of creative achievement,

1143
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,364
but so is extroversion.
So I think that's probably because if 

1144
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:56,060
you're going to be an artist or a 
creative type,

1145
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,900
you better be a bit of a marketer,
you know,

1146
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,760
because it's one thing to sit in your 
garret and paint things,

1147
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:04,170
but what'll happen is you'll starve to 
death and then you know,

1148
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,580
100 years later someone will sell one of
your paintings for $25,000,000,

1149
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,700
which is not very helpful for you,
but if you're extroverted,

1150
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:11,534
you're going to get out there a bit and 
be enthusiastic about what you're 

1151
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:15,860
producing and maybe that gives you an 
opportunity to market it.

1152
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,233
We also know that openness and 
extroversion together make up 

1153
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:20,150
plasticity,
right?

1154
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,780
And plasticity actually seems to be a 
better predictor of creative achievement

1155
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,460
than openness per se.

1156
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,780
So which is

1157
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,823
there's several,
several hundred people in this 

1158
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:32,990
particular sample.

1159
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,543
So

1160
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:36,903
you guys know about this already.
Extroversion is associated with 

1161
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:40,300
happiness,
optimism,

1162
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:41,920
enthusiasm,
gregariousness,

1163
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:44,050
and assertiveness,
neuroticism,

1164
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,503
it.
It correlates negatively with longterm 

1165
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,330
life outcome.
A bet.

1166
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,820
It's not that powerful,
but it's,

1167
00:58:50,821 --> 00:58:51,820
it's,
it's there.

1168
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,893
A height.
People high in neuroticism have a hard 

1169
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:58,080
time with stress so they can get.
I think what happens with neuroticism is

1170
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,790
you pass a certain point of 
vulnerability,

1171
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,163
you know,
if you're too high in neuroticism and 

1172
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:06,940
then some life event comes along that's 
just too much and sucker punches you and

1173
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:10,870
then that further destabilizes your 
nervous system and you're,

1174
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,580
you're kind of out of the game at that 
point.

1175
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,580
So if you're high in negative emotion,
you know you want to.

1176
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,480
I would say the first thing I would say 
is make sure you eat breakfast.

1177
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,613
Sounds like a weird suggestion,
but I know from my clinical practice 

1178
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:24,344
that if I can get my,
my clients who are high in negative 

1179
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,524
emotion to eat a decent breakfast,
that helps stabilize their nervous 

1180
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:31,490
system throughout the day.

1181
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,533
You really got to watch yourself if 
you're high in negative emotion because 

1182
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:34,994
your stress tolerance isn't that great.
So you might also want to not take like 

1183
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,400
really,
really stressful jobs because they grind

1184
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,950
you down over time.
So that's something to think about.

1185
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,520
So agreeableness,
compliance,

1186
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:47,630
empathy,
materiality,

1187
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,370
kinship.
Now on the negative side,

1188
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:50,930
if it gets extreme,
it's criminality,

1189
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:53,360
but disagreeable people are tough 
minded.

1190
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:54,600
They're hard to push around,
you know,

1191
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,860
and they can be a little bit on the 
catalyst side and you know,

1192
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,850
you think,
well,

1193
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,710
is that a useful attribute?
Oh,

1194
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,683
I know this one guy who is dismissed,
disagreeable as you can possibly 

1195
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:07,260
imagine,
you know,

1196
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,230
like,
and he,

1197
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,870
I was watching him work at a large 
corporation.

1198
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:14,270
He was firing people because the 
corporation was shrinking,

1199
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:15,430
like mad.
It was like was,

1200
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,970
it,
was having a real rough time.

1201
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,133
So they had to downsize and I asked him 
how he handled the emotional stress of 

1202
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,570
having to fire people and he said,
well,

1203
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:25,730
he,
that he enjoyed it and I thought,

1204
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,743
wow,
that's not something that I've heard 

1205
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,520
very often.

1206
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,031
He said,
yeah,

1207
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:33,440
I mean most of the people that are fire 
or they've been useless and they've been

1208
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:36,830
like a existing on other people's Labor 
for like 10 years.

1209
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,350
No one's ever called them on it.
So it doesn't bother me a bit.

1210
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:42,900
I just think of all the people who 
they've been interfering with and,

1211
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,970
and I think,
well,

1212
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:44,804
good,
you deserve to be gone and you don't 

1213
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:47,750
have to be a tough son of a bitch to do 
that,

1214
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,680
you know,
you know,

1215
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,140
you think about that,
you think about that because,

1216
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,210
and I do a fair bit of management 
consulting.

1217
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:57,680
So let's say you're a manager and you've
got 10 employees and one of them is hard

1218
01:00:57,681 --> 01:01:01,280
to get along with and not productive.
And so because they're hard to get along

1219
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:02,114
with,
they make everyone else's life more 

1220
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:06,410
miserable than it has to be and because 
they're not productive,

1221
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:08,090
then everybody else has to do their 
work.

1222
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,800
So then you might say,
well,

1223
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,693
you know,
what are you going to do about that 

1224
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:11,871
person?
And I don't know,

1225
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:12,704
maybe they have a sick parent.
You know that too because people are 

1226
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,390
complicated.
So what do you think you think,

1227
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,170
wow,
this person's in place in their life.

1228
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,080
And uh,
so what do you do about that?

1229
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,140
Well,
you think maybe if you're compassionate,

1230
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:27,651
you think,
well,

1231
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,220
you know,
they've,

1232
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,720
they've got a difficult situation at 
home.

1233
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:30,554
They've got a sick parent,
this isn't a really good time to fire 

1234
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:33,110
them,
La Blah Blah,

1235
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,063
but then you think,
what about those other nine people you 

1236
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:37,634
know going to work for them that's not 
near as good as it could be and like 

1237
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,593
they're working hard but they're not 
benefiting from it and plus the fact 

1238
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:47,660
that this person gets away with it is 
demotivating and unfair.

1239
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,310
So then you've got to ask yourself,
well,

1240
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:51,530
exactly who are you being empathic with?

1241
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,650
And this is a hard question.
Like it's seriously,

1242
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:55,484
this is a very difficult question when 
you're in an organization and you're 

1243
01:01:57,741 --> 01:02:00,110
trying to build something that goes into
a particular direction.

1244
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,270
It's like,
well what's your threshold?

1245
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,480
Like my experience,
and I wouldn't say I'm very good at this

1246
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:09,140
because I'm kind of tender hearted,
much to my chagrin so,

1247
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,423
but my experience doing management 
consulting with people is that if they 

1248
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:14,174
have someone who is a problem and 
they've been a problem for say a 

1249
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:16,934
substantial amount of time,
everybody's happier when that person 

1250
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:22,080
leaves,
often the person themself.

1251
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:22,973
Not always obviously,
but sometimes people are miserable and 

1252
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:26,664
hard to get along with.
An unproductive because they hate their 

1253
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:28,614
bloody job and someone should just kick 
them out of it so they can go on and 

1254
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:32,130
find something,
you know,

1255
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:34,680
that they might be half decent tap.
So.

1256
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,400
And people tend to be quite resilient.
So even if they do end up out of a job,

1257
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,860
it isn't exactly clear that six months 
later that's worse for them.

1258
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,290
So anyway,
so that's,

1259
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,124
that's,
I think disagreeable people are better 

1260
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,100
at that.
So if there's a rule,

1261
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:54,660
a disagreeable person will say,
you buy,

1262
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,030
abide by the rule,
I don't care about your damn feelings.

1263
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,920
It's like,
well that's Kinda harsh.

1264
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,353
Maybe

1265
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,070
conscientiousness.
That's a big predictor.

1266
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,020
Openness that's associated with 
creativity.

1267
01:03:06,021 --> 01:03:08,690
Intelligence.
Here's some combinations.

1268
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,650
If you're disagreeable and neurotic,
you tend to have a personality disorder.

1269
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,100
So those are the two big personality 
markers of personality disorders.

1270
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,730
If you're extroverted and disagreeable,
think about that.

1271
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:21,950
You know,
people like this,

1272
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,540
they're really social in there.
Really.

1273
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,523
You know,
they're,

1274
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,140
they're not that empathic,
they're selfish,

1275
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,930
they're narcissists.
If you're extroverted and disagreeable,

1276
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,470
you have a proclivity towards narcissism
and you might think,

1277
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:35,930
well that's an awful thing and maybe it 
is,

1278
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:39,220
but
actors,

1279
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,590
I mean how,
how narcissistic do you have to be to be

1280
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:45,050
an actor?
Oh,

1281
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,170
that's a hard question,
right?

1282
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:47,004
Because you obviously have to have some 
self confidence that goes beyond the 

1283
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:50,850
norm.
So

1284
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,133
anyway,
so

1285
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:56,923
this is a summary of what we knew about 
emotion and motivation in relationship 

1286
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:01,004
to the abortion,
so we know that extroversion is 

1287
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,510
associated with incentive reward,
hope,

1288
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:07,520
curiosity,
play enthusiasm.

1289
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:08,623
That seems to be associated with 
dopaminergic function and with the part 

1290
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,160
of the hypothalamus that governance 
exploratory behavior.

1291
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,413
So it's an approach circuit and so it 
seems that people who are extroverted 

1292
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:22,280
have a lower threshold for having that 
circuit activated.

1293
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:23,114
Maybe it's something like that or,
or maybe they're there unless they're 

1294
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,540
stimulated,
they don't have enough positive emotion.

1295
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,374
It's not that easy to tell.
Extroverts harvest attention from the 

1296
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:34,724
social group.
So you think about these as ways of 

1297
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,633
adapting to the world.
Like the social group is full of 

1298
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:43,280
resources and if you're assertive and 
you're popular,

1299
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,490
than you can benefit from the accrual of
social resources.

1300
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:47,810
That puts you up the dominance 
hierarchy.

1301
01:04:47,811 --> 01:04:49,660
So it's a good strategy for moving.

1302
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,640
It's one good strategy for moving ahead.
Um,

1303
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,040
neuroticism,
pain,

1304
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,300
frustration,
disappointment,

1305
01:04:56,301 --> 01:04:57,410
fear,
anxiety.

1306
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,663
Those two seem to be associated with 
Gaba circuits because those are the 

1307
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:04,820
circuits that value and barbiturates and
benzodiazepines effect.

1308
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:05,654
And it's also the case that as you move 
up the dominance hierarchy and your 

1309
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:09,134
serotonin levels rise,
your negative emotion gets more 

1310
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,613
well-regulated.
Whereas if you fall down on the 

1311
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:14,684
dominance hierarchy,
then your negative emotions get less 

1312
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,973
regulated.
Probably your positive emotions too 

1313
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,000
agreeable.
This empathy,

1314
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:22,834
sympathy compliance care system,
that's the care system that Jaak 

1315
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,150
Panksepp described.
So if you're interested in that,

1316
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:28,984
you could read a bit more about that.
That's maternal circuitry essentially 

1317
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:36,040
now runs on oxytocin.
So agreeable people can always tell when

1318
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:36,874
I have an agreeable person in my 
clinical practice because what happens 

1319
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:40,594
when they come in is that they instantly
start to talk about relationships and 

1320
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,520
also their layout,
their biography,

1321
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,440
and like a conscientious person.

1322
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,273
We'll talk about the things they have to
do and the things they've done over 

1323
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:52,540
their life and an open person will say,
well,

1324
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,400
here's the things I'm really interested 
in,

1325
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,350
you know,
but an agreeable personal say,

1326
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,090
well,
from 19 seven,

1327
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,233
1982 to 1987,
I went out with this person and then I 

1328
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:03,724
had a relationship with this person.
And so they naturally seem to configure 

1329
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:10,630
their biographies in terms of dyadic 
intimate relationships.

1330
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,950
So whereas the disagreeable people,
you know,

1331
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,680
well they're,
they're,

1332
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,100
they're not so good at that kind of 
thing.

1333
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:20,210
And if you talk to engineers,
for example,

1334
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,880
and I've talked a lot about silicon 
valley,

1335
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:22,714
it's there,
they're pretty oriented towards things 

1336
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,270
and their interpersonal skills can be

1337
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,070
well interesting to say the least,
but you know,

1338
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:36,680
they invent lots of interesting things.
So like Hooray,

1339
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,210
go,
go engineers.

1340
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:39,583
We've talked about conscientiousness and
it seems to be associated with disgust 

1341
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:43,244
and guilt and shame and the,
if you think about it as an adaptive 

1342
01:06:47,151 --> 01:06:47,984
strategy,
orderliness means stay on contaminated 

1343
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:52,580
and sparkly,
clean.

1344
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:55,010
You know,
it's like an efficiency strategy.

1345
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,280
Everything in its place.
And so that way you don't have to expend

1346
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:02,240
as much energy to get the results of 
your labor.

1347
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,074
You know what it's like if you're trying
to work in your office and it's a 

1348
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,130
complete bloody disaster,
right?

1349
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,203
You expand the whole bunch of energy 
just coping with the fact that you're 

1350
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:11,444
surrounded by chaos before you even get 
down to what it is that you're supposed 

1351
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:17,360
to work at.
Industriousness,

1352
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:18,194
while industrious people seem to 
implement their goals and maybe they 

1353
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,190
have some social utility to I would 
suspect,

1354
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:26,024
right?
Because if you're an industrious person 

1355
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:27,824
and you get a reputation for that,
then people are gonna want you around 

1356
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:31,543
because like you'll do the work.
And one thing I will tell you that that 

1357
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:34,874
might also be useful as you progress 
through life is that if you get into an 

1358
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:38,984
organization and you are diligent and 
you know and you really commit to what 

1359
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:46,130
you're doing,
you might think

1360
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,270
you might be cynical about whether or 
not that's going to be noticed.

1361
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:52,850
But I'll tell you,
if you're not conscientious,

1362
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:55,250
you'll never figure out why you don't 
advance.

1363
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,633
What'll happen is that a bunch of doors 
that could open to you just won't 

1364
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,840
because if you're a conscientious,
so like I find this with my students.

1365
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,713
Some of them I can say because I have 
more opportunities than I know what to 

1366
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:11,600
do with usually.
And so if I have students I can say,

1367
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:12,081
well,
you know,

1368
01:08:12,081 --> 01:08:12,914
here you could do this,
and then if they come back three weeks 

1369
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,401
later and they say,
well,

1370
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,170
here's four reasons why I couldn't do 
it,

1371
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,880
and they're all good reasons,
you know,

1372
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:20,983
but it's not done.
And then someone else comes back and 

1373
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:25,010
it's four weeks later and they say,
here it is.

1374
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:29,210
Then the next time I have an opportunity
to end the person who did it gets it.

1375
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,930
And so what happens is that in almost 
all organizations,

1376
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,423
there's a certain percentage of people 
who are conscientious and intelligent 

1377
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:39,194
and are doing almost all the work and 
they're always looking around for other 

1378
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:43,850
people who are like that.

1379
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,950
Like they don't go out of their way to 
advertise it.

1380
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,784
But if,
if you're like that and you come to 

1381
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:50,270
their attention,
they'll open doors for you.

1382
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:51,104
And you won't even know it,
and so it'll be like your progress 

1383
01:08:53,481 --> 01:08:56,780
upwards and there's no reason that you 
leave a necessarily knowing why.

1384
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,643
Whereas if you're not doing it,
people won't come out and whack you on 

1385
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:00,651
the head and say,
well,

1386
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:02,920
you should improve in these six ways and
you know,

1387
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,763
pay a lot of attention to you.
They just won't allow you to have any 

1388
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:09,230
opportunities and then you won't even 
know it.

1389
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,670
So that's not good unless you want to 
know,

1390
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:13,543
unless you're not that ambitious,
which you know is not necessarily a bad 

1391
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:21,770
thing.
Open people will open.

1392
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,560
People are good at manipulating 
abstractions.

1393
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:24,394
And so what they seem to do is to model 
the world abstractly and to figure out 

1394
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:28,820
what strategies will work.

1395
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,103
And then maybe they can implement them 
if they're conscientious and if they 

1396
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:35,720
can't implement them well maybe they can
offer them to other people you know.

1397
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:38,240
So you have good ideas that has some 
value.

1398
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,313
And so I was thinking that
we don't exactly know how to integrate 

1399
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,580
the trait theory into the narrative 
theories.

1400
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:47,710
You know,
there,

1401
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,613
because almost all of the clinical 
theories of psychology are narrative 

1402
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:52,634
theories and they all seem to have to do
with this kind of story that you act 

1403
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:56,714
out,
but I've been thinking that maybe this 

1404
01:09:57,741 --> 01:10:00,560
is one of the ways that you could 
conceptualize it anyway,

1405
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:04,580
so the little frames of reference that 
you find yourself in that,

1406
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,713
that govern your perceptions and that 
help you determine your actions are 

1407
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:15,020
maybe motivated by constellations of 
fundamental motivational systems.

1408
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,350
So you know,
we,

1409
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,203
we talked a little bit about 
hypothalamic function and the really 

1410
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,680
basic motivational and emotional states.

1411
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:22,933
Well,
it seems like they sort of clumped 

1412
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:25,084
together in the traits.
So we know extroversion is where the 

1413
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:28,994
positive emotions clump.
A negative neuroticism is where the 

1414
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:34,280
negative emotions clump,
play seems to go along with extroversion

1415
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,353
and then abstract creativity and 
exploration seems to go along with 

1416
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,044
openness and so on.
And so there's these like maybe the 

1417
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,560
traits or something like amalgam stable 
amalgams of emotions and motivation,

1418
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:50,080
something like that.
And then they're,

1419
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:54,470
those stable amalgams produce the 
frameworks within which you operate.

1420
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:55,880
So here's an example.
So

1421
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,700
if you're extroverted,
you're goal is going to be,

1422
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:02,534
well there's a group I'm going to 
integrate myself into it and I'm going 

1423
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:12,011
to make my presence known and enjoyable 
because we know for example,

1424
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:13,574
that like parties and so that's an 
adaptive strategy because they have the 

1425
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:18,214
social hierarchy out there and that 
that's a place where rewards can be 

1426
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:22,644
obtained and so are fundamental tilt is 
towards exploitation of the social 

1427
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:26,520
surround.

1428
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,830
It's probably a bit of a trade because 
extroverts,

1429
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:29,664
you know,
there it can be very amusing to be with 

1430
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,213
and they're always trying to entertain 
people so it's not like it's a one way 

1431
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:36,370
street.
Whereas you know,

1432
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,253
someone who's more,
more conscientious is going to be well 

1433
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,283
you know,
this place is in bad order and it needs 

1434
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:45,310
to be repaired and we should do 
something to straighten that up.

1435
01:11:45,311 --> 01:11:49,800
And so that's like a generalized rubric 
that they're using to apply to the world

1436
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,630
in every different situation.
And so that's.

1437
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,440
So it sort of like base level 
motivations and emotions.

1438
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,573
The first order aggregation,
which gives you maybe the five 

1439
01:11:58,261 --> 01:12:01,590
dimensions and then those actor as the 
underlying,

1440
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:04,463
what the underlying primarily biological
systems that tilt your perceptions in 

1441
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:11,280
your actions toward certain niches in 
the environment.

1442
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,250
So the agreeable person is going to go 
for relationships.

1443
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:15,443
The disagreeable person is going to be 
selfish somewhat or self oriented 

1444
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,650
anyways,
and competitive.

1445
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:21,990
These are all ways that you can go 
through the world.

1446
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:22,973
If you're high in negative emotion,
then you're going to be quite concerned 

1447
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:28,560
with making sure that things are secure 
and safe.

1448
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,810
You can see that those are all valid.

1449
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,163
A priory theories about how you might 
adapt to the different niches that the 

1450
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:39,890
world provides.
So,

1451
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:44,500
so then I would say that it's something 
like that.

1452
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,334
These hierarchies of values are built up
around the fundamental trait 

1453
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:53,130
orientations.
It's something like that.

1454
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,421
So,
you know,

1455
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:56,640
for an extrovert,
something down here might be,

1456
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,980
tell a joke,
you know,

1457
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,020
plan a party,
um,

1458
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,010
go to a bar,
you know,

1459
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,090
those are all made up of obviously 
implementable,

1460
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,610
implementable behaviors,
but they're fairly,

1461
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,640
they're fractured and elements of what 
constitutes extroversion.

1462
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,550
What is it?
Well,

1463
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:20,551
that's probably pretty good.
Yeah.

1464
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:22,403
Okay,
so we'll stop there and then I'll see 

1465
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:29,931
you on Thursday and that's it.
You guys know the final is cumulative,

1466
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:35,660
I presume so it'll only be covering the 
material that was from the last test and

1467
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,650
it'll be the same format as the other 
tests.

1468
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:39,930
So you're familiar with them,
you know what's coming.

1469
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:43,290
Okay.
See you on Thursday.
