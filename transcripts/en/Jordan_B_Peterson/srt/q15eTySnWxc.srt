1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay
on

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,850
to more trait
conscientiousness.

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,640
Conscientiousness is a good predictor of
longterm life success.

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,860
It's a good predictor negatively of 
divorce.

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,770
So I'm more conscientious.
People are less likely to get divorced.

6
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,130
It's a really good predictor of grades.
It's a decent predictor of income.

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,670
It's a good predictor of social status,
eventual social status.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,940
It seems to be particularly good at 
predicting

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,363
outcomes for people who are engaged in 
managerial administrative and process 

10
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,034
management occupations.
And so all of those occupations are 

11
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:56,800
characterized by the necessity of 
reliability,

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,220
integrity,
and um,

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,280
attention to detail.
It's not associated with creativity,

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,260
right?
That's openness.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
So the open people are better artists 
and entrepreneurs by all appearances.

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,933
So
all together conscientiousness seems to 

17
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:20,434
be relatively positive trait.
And so then you might wonder why there 

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,750
was a distribution,
right?

19
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,230
Like why isn't everybody hyper 
conscientious?

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Well,
it appears at least in part that as with

21
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:35,584
all the other personality dimensions,
there's increasing price to be paid as 

22
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:44,110
you deviate from the average.
And so unconscientious people,

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,130
they tend to rely on others to support 
them.

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,820
They're not particularly ambitious or 
reliable.

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,773
Okay.

26
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,700
But they're not particularly rigid 
either.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
And so one possibility might be that low
levels of conscientiousness are an asset

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,840
at certain times when combined with 
other traits.

29
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:12,841
So for example,
the data isn't all in on this yet,

30
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:17,620
but it seems to me quite likely that 
orderliness,

31
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:18,454
which is an aspect of conscientiousness,
conscientiousness breaks down into 

32
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:22,834
orderliness and industriousness and 
those actually seem to be importantly 

33
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,714
different.
I think orderliness probably puts an 

34
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,370
additional constraint on creativity.
No.

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,950
So we've studied entrepreneurs for a 
long time and uh,

36
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,613
it's clear that higher levels of 
orderliness certainly aren't associated 

37
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:47,140
with entrepreneur entrepreneurial 
capacity.

38
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:51,540
And I have the sneaking suspicion that 
that's because you know,

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,383
orderly people are very concerned with 
doing whatever needs to be done in the 

40
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,240
particular way that it's supposed to be 
done.

41
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,050
And the with that is,
is that if you're a creative,

42
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,150
so if you're engaged in a creative 
enterprise,

43
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,980
the thing flips around on you a lot.

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,210
Like there's a lot of transformations as
you're moving towards the end and that's

45
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,150
not exactly something in orderly person 
is going to appreciate.

46
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,750
I also suspect that orderly people are 
likely to,

47
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,600
there are two likely to obey rules to be
entrepreneurial or creative.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,180
Now obviously obeying rules has its 
utility,

49
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,140
right?
But it doesn't,

50
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:26,974
when the rules are wrong or when they 
start to interfere with something that 

51
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:34,360
might be conceptualized as higher a 
higher value than the rules themselves.

52
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,243
For conscientious people,
it's not self evident that there are 

53
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:43,300
more important values than following the
rules and doing things properly.

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,180
And so,
you know,

55
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,014
that's part of what makes them reliable 
workers and decent citizens and all of 

56
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,734
that sort of thing.
It's also partly what tips them towards 

57
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,584
conservatism on the political spectrum.
So the best predictors of political 

58
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:01,150
conservatism are low openness and high 
conscientiousness,

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,193
particularly orderliness.
So actually liberals and conservatives 

60
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,920
don't seem to be much different than one
another in terms of industriousness,

61
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,910
but they're quite markedly different in 
terms of orderliness or,

62
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:13,691
you know,
you could say,

63
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,524
well,
what predicts liberalism is high 

64
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,640
openness and low conscientiousness,
particularly orderliness,

65
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,853
uh,
because you don't necessarily have to 

66
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:25,000
just be predicting con conservatism.
So

67
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,643
now

68
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,843
you remember the big two model.
So conscientiousness lumps in with 

69
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,010
emotional stability and agreeableness to
produce stability.

70
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,430
And as people age,
they become more stable,

71
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,293
they become more conscientious,
more emotionally stable and more 

72
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,360
agreeable.
And you know,

73
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,194
you probably interpret that somewhat 
pleasantly as an improvement in 

74
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,064
maturity.

75
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,423
So,

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,280
and conscientiousness is quite highly 
correlated with neuroticism negatively.

77
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:02,700
So it turns out generally speaking,
that the more conscientious you are,

78
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:05,750
the less neurotic you are.
And we,

79
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,773
we think that that might be actually 
because of the tendency of 

80
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:13,911
conscientiousness as a trait manifested 
across time to stabilize environments.

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,610
You know,
so if you're a conscientious person,

82
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,040
imagine that because you're 
conscientious,

83
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:20,874
but not perfectionistic.
Let's say you stay on top of your 

84
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,180
homework and you get your assignments 
done,

85
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,180
let's even say ahead of time.
Well,

86
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,014
partly what that means is that the 
amount that you have to worry about how 

87
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,574
you're going to be doing decreases.
And of course if you're conscientious 

88
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:39,344
and over time your field of 
opportunities opens up from an 

89
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:44,814
employment perspective,
plus your income increases and you've 

90
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,024
stabilized the environment around you.
And so there's less uncertainty in it 

91
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,500
and more security.
And so,

92
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,023
you know,
it could easily be that 

93
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:57,000
conscientiousness has its effect on 
neuroticism,

94
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,060
stabilizing the environment,
taking the uncertainty out of it,

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,193
and then making people not so much 
really less like lower in neuroticism 

96
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:09,060
but just less likely to be anxious and 
in emotional pain in general.

97
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,523
So,

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,490
so here's some distinctions between 
orderliness and industriousness.

99
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,240
You guys can decide where you fit on 
these.

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,373
So if you're orderly,
you don't leave your belongings around 

101
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,010
you like order,
that's I'm surprised at one,

102
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,590
you keep things tidy,
you follow a schedule,

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,010
okay,

104
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,850
you're bothered by messy people.
You want everything to be just right.

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,370
You're bothered by disorder,
you don't,

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,930
you,
you like routine,

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,430
you see that rules are observed and you 
want every detail taken care of.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,190
So the other thing you can kind of 
understand likely is the door.

109
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,750
To me,
people aren't that much fun,

110
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,870
you know?
And I also think that's relevant because

111
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,093
you know,
people have different kinds of social 

112
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,500
value,
right?

113
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,550
And sometimes you value people because 
of their ability to contribute,

114
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,330
perhaps from an economic perspective 
because they're hard workers and they're

115
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,590
productive.
But you know,

116
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,424
when you think about Comedians,
comedians have a fairly high social 

117
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,430
value as far as I'm concerned,
but the probability that they're orderly

118
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,950
as a class is pretty much zero.
It was,

119
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:20,951
people are high in high in extroversion,
clearly low in agreeableness,

120
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:22,844
generally speaking,
because you're just not going to make 

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,250
rude comments about people to get alive,
which is what comedians do.

122
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,083
At least 50% of the time unless you're 
disagreeable and they have to be pretty 

123
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:37,511
low in conscientiousness because like 
really a conscientious comedian,

124
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,743
is this just not going to happen?
The lifestyle doesn't lend itself to 

125
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:41,721
that,
right?

126
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,130
I mean,
it's erratic.

127
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:43,964
Your employment is going to be erratic.
The probability that you're going to be 

128
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,500
regularly employed is low.
You're up at night all the time.

129
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,380
You're always partying because that 
would go,

130
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,950
that's the meal you,
that you're in,

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,670
you know?
Um,

132
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,460
and then you might,
you know,

133
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,180
you might think the same about people 
who are artistic performers,

134
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,320
like musicians.
You know,

135
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,360
if you want to be a rock musician for 
example,

136
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,194
when you're a teenager,
of course that makes you just a typical 

137
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,804
teenager in some ways.
But if you're going to pursue that into 

138
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,254
adulthood,
there's a lot of many more stable 

139
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,130
occupations that you have to forego.

140
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,440
You know,
when you have to be willing to adopt the

141
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:19,430
route of erratic and unpredictable 
lifestyle that would go along with being

142
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,264
say a traveling musician.
And that also has to not make you feel 

143
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,230
bad.
And you know,

144
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,430
we don't exactly know what makes people 
industrious or,

145
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,264
or conscientious,
but avoiding feeling bad seems to be 

146
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,230
some seems to have something to do with 
it except that it's complicated.

147
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:38,064
They,
because the hypothesis fundamentally 

148
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,634
behind the big five traits analysis is 
that all the negative emotions load 

149
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,320
together on a single factor,
right?

150
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,520
So that's fundamentally neuroticism.
So then you might say,

151
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,354
well,
if it's neuroticism that all the 

152
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,304
negative emotions are loading on what's 
left over for the conscientious people 

153
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,454
to use to feel bad with.
And we think that conscientiousness 

154
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,364
isn't a well understood dementia.
Like it's understood from a measurement 

155
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,820
perspective,
we can measure it quite accurately,

156
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,654
but mostly only using questionnaires,
either self report or other persons a 

157
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,950
report.

158
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,783
We don't have any direct measures of 
industriousness and so and so that's 

159
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,060
kind of strange because it's such a 
potent phenomena that you think that you

160
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,570
could come up with lab tasks that 
industrious people for example,

161
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,480
would do a better job that than non 
industrious people,

162
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:34,440
but we haven't been able to identify one
and we probably screamed 50 years,

163
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,310
50 to 75 different tasks,
never got any effect at all.

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,193
With orderliness though,
we've had more luck because what 

165
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:47,811
orderliness seems to be associated with,
although not overwhelmingly powerfully,

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,130
is disgust,
sensitivity and so discussed seems to be

167
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:58,131
an emotional axis that's distinct to 
some degree from neuroticism.

168
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,300
And you know,
you might say,

169
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,530
well,
the disgusting things,

170
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,480
if you're too close to a disgusting 
thing,

171
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,720
you'd also get anxious.
And I think that's probably true,

172
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,793
but the emotion of disgust isn't the 
same as the emotion of anxiety or the 

173
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,500
emotion of pain.

174
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,690
Disgust is a revulsion emotion.
It's a getaway from me emotion.

175
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
Sometimes it's an emotion that will 
elicit anger,

176
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,254
defensive anger,
to push something disgusting the way or 

177
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,200
to be contemptuous of it or to roll your
eyes at it.

178
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,650
Now,
here's an interesting little fact.

179
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,750
One of the best predictors of impending 
divorce is eye rolling.

180
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,890
So if you have a couple in therapy and 
you notice that when one talks,

181
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,640
the other rolls their eyes,
you know that that's just not very good.

182
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,040
So that's something to remember in your 
own relationships.

183
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,020
If you're starting to roll your eyes at 
your partner,

184
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,100
you might think,
well,

185
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,263
that's a contemporary response.
That's a disgust response if you're 

186
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:57,030
starting to do that,
that it's either time to stop or time to

187
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,850
start looking for a new partner.
So

188
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,513
now the orderliness discussed connection
turns out to be theoretically extremely 

189
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,464
interesting,
and we're going to talk about that in 

190
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,930
some detail as we move forward.

191
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,300
But I'll go through industriousness 
next.

192
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:16,380
And so an industrious person carries out
their plans.

193
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,010
Now that might be the critical element 
of industriousness.

194
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,430
So if you look at the general 
neuropsychological literature,

195
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,264
what you generally derived from that is 
that the prefrontal cortex is involved 

196
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:31,470
in behavioral regulation because the 
prefrontal Cortex is the,

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,400
is the part of the brain that people use
to generate plans.

198
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,700
And dorsolateral prefrontal cortical 
function is primarily cognitive,

199
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,700
at least in so far as we've been able to
measure it.

200
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,953
And the cognitive abilities of the 
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex appear 

201
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:52,890
to be quite tightly linked to fluid 
intelligence as we discussed before.

202
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,123
And so it also stands to reason to some 
degree that your ability to plan and 

203
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:58,594
your intelligence might be associated 
with your ability to carry out your 

204
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:07,531
plans are not to waste time.
The cortex overall has been viewed as an

205
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,550
organ that inhibits impulsivity.

206
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,190
You know,
but as we've discussed,

207
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,323
the idea that impulsivity is inhibited 
is probably not the world's most 

208
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,944
sophisticated idea.
It's probably more that impulsivity is 

209
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,874
unnecessary if you've developed a 
sufficiently sophisticated personality 

210
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,554
because you can get what you need to 
have through more complex and 

211
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,540
sophisticated means with less social 
conflict.

212
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,870
But anyways,
there's this idea that's been maintained

213
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,930
in the neuropsychological literature for
a very long time,

214
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:42,931
that the ability to plan is associated 
with increased control over impulsivity.

215
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,890
But the problem with that theory is that
it doesn't seem to be true.

216
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,810
So there's no correlation.
The correlation between intelligence and

217
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,770
industriousness is zero.
And that's weird because man,

218
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,020
if you take intelligence and correlate 
it with something,

219
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,420
it's correlated with almost everything,
you know.

220
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:05,470
So even disgust sensitivity if,
if we measured this test sensitivity and

221
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:08,890
there's a variety of ways of doing that.
What we find is more intelligent,

222
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,900
people are less disgust sensitive.

223
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,640
So even,
and you know,

224
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,190
the connection there is by no means 
obvious,

225
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,024
right?
Because you could just as easily think 

226
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,070
that intelligent people would be less or
it would be more disgusted sensitive.

227
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,310
But that hasn't,
that isn't how it is now.

228
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,144
The idea of carrying out your plans,
that's an interesting one because 

229
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,060
imagine,
think about what cognition is like,

230
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,480
especially abstract cognition of the 
kind that we were talking about last,

231
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,660
last,
uh,

232
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,250
last class.
In order to abstract,

233
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:44,251
you have to separate the objects of your
internal manipulation from the world,

234
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,050
right?
So here,

235
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,420
here's an example.
So when you go to sleep at night,

236
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,480
there's a little switch,
for lack of a better term,

237
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,763
that shuts your body down.
And so what happens is that when you're 

238
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,564
dreaming,
of course you're dreaming about running 

239
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:02,710
around and you move your eyes while 
you're dreaming.

240
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:03,544
Now it turns out that the motor systems 
that control your eyes aren't shutdown 

241
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,360
because who cares?

242
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,610
You can move your eyes and still be in 
bed asleep,

243
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,503
not running around in your dream.
But if you take a cat or another animal 

244
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:14,794
and you destroy that off,
switch the capitol run around and act 

245
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,490
out its dreams,
okay?

246
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,950
So it's thinking is linked to its 
behavior.

247
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,140
So integrity that when it runs a 
simulation,

248
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,760
it's going to act it out.
Now,

249
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:28,594
human beings don't do that.
What happens when we think or we often 

250
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:32,764
don't do that?
There are times when we can avoid doing 

251
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,550
that.
You know,

252
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,384
when you think you sit there,
you generate up your world of 

253
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,324
abstraction,
you have your abstract representations 

254
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,410
and you manipulate them.
And so you might think,

255
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,390
well this is what I'm going to do to 
tomorrow.

256
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,373
You run a simulation in your head,
but you wouldn't be able to do that if 

257
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:54,410
you couldn't pull the simulated you away
from the actual view,

258
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,680
right?

259
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,513
You have to divorce the representation 
from the thing it's representing in 

260
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,354
order to manipulate it abstractly.
So that opens up the possibility that 

261
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:07,670
you can think through things perfectly 
well without ever enacting your plans.

262
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,720
And that's actually what you see in the 
therapeutic realm.

263
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:15,140
If you have a client who's 
unconscientious,

264
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,723
you've got a real problem because the 
person won't do anything that they say 

265
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,380
they're going to do.
And so,

266
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,330
you know,
generally speaking,

267
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,213
especially for behavioral therapy,
what happens is that someone will come 

268
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:28,424
in with a problem and you discuss an 
array of potential solutions and you 

269
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,374
know,
an intelligent person could do that 

270
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,773
better than an unintelligent person.
And then you decide which of those 

271
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,780
potential solutions might be 
implemented.

272
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,270
And then you wait,
you know,

273
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,390
you don't want to put too much of a 
burden on the person because you want to

274
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,160
make the probability that they'll 
actually implement the change very high.

275
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,993
So you do it quite slowly because people
aren't that good at implementing 

276
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,340
behavioral changes.
And then,

277
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,203
you know,
hopefully the person comes back and 

278
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:00,441
says,
well,

279
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:04,100
I've tried this and here's the outcome,
and then you modify it accordingly.

280
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,934
It's got,
it's called essentially called 

281
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,080
collaborative empiricism.
Um,

282
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,913
but the problem with doing that with 
someone who's unconscientious is that 

283
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,400
they'll come back and they'll say,
well,

284
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,960
I didn't get around to it.
It's like,

285
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,853
okay,
well what are you supposed to do about 

286
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,564
that?
It's like if the person doesn't get 

287
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,960
around to doing things,
that'll help.

288
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,930
How can you get them to get around to 
doing anything that'll help?

289
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,793
It's,
it's one of those flaws that seems to 

290
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,390
interfere with the process itself.
You know?

291
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,340
Now I could say,
well,

292
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,383
maybe you could make the person 
enthusiastic about it and they'd be 

293
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,580
driven by enthusiasm,
which is more of a positive emotion.

294
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,413
Or maybe you could terrify them half to 
death by the negative consequences of 

295
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,270
not doing it,
which is also useful.

296
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,470
Or maybe they're agreeable and so they'd
be willing to do it for someone else.

297
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,450
Like there's other places or if they're 
open,

298
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,070
you can think of a creative way to do 
it.

299
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,110
There's other places you can get 
leverage,

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,370
but without the conscientiousness 
there's a real problem.

301
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,930
It's really,
it's really difficult.

302
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,783
Okay.
So industriousness seems to be 

303
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,540
associated with the ability or the 
willingness.

304
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,493
God only knows to take plans that are 
formulated and then to implement them 

305
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:10,934
into behavior in [inaudible],
the voluntarily into behavior and you 

306
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:15,944
know,
everyone knows that's a relatively 

307
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,960
difficult thing to do.
You know,

308
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:20,810
if you're trying to settle yourself down
to do a task,

309
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,320
especially when you don't want to do so,
you're not enthusiastic about it.

310
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,550
Right.
That can't carry you.

311
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,820
Do you want to settle down and do a task
that you're not enthusiastic about?

312
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,680
That takes effort?
You know,

313
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,514
you could say it takes willpower.
And I actually think the conscientious 

314
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,080
person,
especially,

315
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,430
I think especially the orderly person,
is an addict,

316
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,573
is a person who admires willpower.
And that seems to be associated with 

317
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,720
something like due to fullness as a,
as a moral construct.

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,793
So a conscientious person will do 
something because they should do it or 

319
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:52,014
because they have a duty to do it.
And that's partly also why you see 

320
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,210
conscientiousness as an element of 
conservatism.

321
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,640
Because conservatives tend to be more 
patriotic,

322
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,474
for example,
and they are more willing to think of 

323
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,020
their moral obligation in terms of 
service to the structured community.

324
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,180
Now we just did a factor analysis of 
conservative belief,

325
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,014
conservative versus liberal belief.
And one of my students is presenting 

326
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,100
that for her phd defense.

327
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,960
We took a long time to do it about four 
years to really get the measures down.

328
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:21,794
And you know,
you hear about social conservative than 

329
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,450
fiscal social conservatism and fiscal 
conservatism,

330
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,100
right?
So the social conservatives,

331
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,220
conservatives are usually in the,
in the states,

332
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,470
they're prolife,
they're,

333
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,200
um,
they're,

334
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,034
they're,
they're usually not fans of gay 

335
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,580
marriage.
They're,

336
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,711
they're,
you know,

337
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:46,860
they're not advocates.
Generally speaking of a welfare state,

338
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,640
they're against single parent families 
or that,

339
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,720
you know,
so that's all social conservative.

340
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:55,170
It's,
it's like a moral,

341
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,243
it's a moral dimension of belief.
Whereas fiscal conservativism is 

342
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,400
something like don't run deficits,
you know,

343
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,960
if you want it to put it,
simply don't spend,

344
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,780
the government shouldn't spend any more 
money a than it has.

345
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,693
And so that's an important principle.
But it also isn't an agent of economic 

346
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,710
development.
It's not really seen that way.

347
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,540
They're more like minimal government 
people,

348
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,560
but we got no evidence for a split 
between fiscal and social conservatism.

349
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,393
So I don't think it exists.
I think it's just a media invention 

350
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,153
because we did construct validation of 
the sort that I've been talking to you 

351
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,280
about.
What we got instead were three factors.

352
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,073
We got masculine independence.
That's what we decided to call it 

353
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,270
because it was much more common among 
men.

354
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,520
And it kind of looked like 
libertarianism,

355
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,953
which is a brand of conservatism,
which is basically you go and do your 

356
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,764
bloody thing and I'll do my thing and 
we'll either leave each other alone or 

357
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,274
if we don't,
we'll compete and one of us can win and 

358
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:51,420
that'll be just fine.
So it looked like,

359
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,150
so one of the things that's interesting 
about that,

360
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,420
and it really got me thinking was that,
you know,

361
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,093
that classic explanation for why 
Conservatives are conservative is 

362
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:04,560
because they're afraid of,
they're afraid,

363
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,240
but there's just no evidence for that.

364
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,870
Conservatives are less neurotic than 
liberals by a substantial margin.

365
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,093
And you know,
there is evidence that they have a 

366
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,630
negativity bias,
which I don't really want to explain,

367
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,643
but what that means sometimes is that 
they'll actually pay more attention to 

368
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,600
negative information rather than less in
comparison to liberal.

369
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:27,210
So what it means is not clear,
but the masculine independence dimension

370
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,044
is a very interesting one because it 
implies that there's a reason for 

371
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:31,614
hierarchy beyond structure.
You can't win unless you play a 

372
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:35,814
structure game.
So you know what a lot of what the 

373
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:39,234
masculine,
independent types want is they want to 

374
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:44,430
say just get the damn rules straight.
I don't really care what they are,

375
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,440
but if you get them straight,
all follow them.

376
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,550
But that'll so hierarchy because that,
you know,

377
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,160
as soon as you,
it's approved,

378
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,043
produced a value structure,
you produce a hierarchy because people 

379
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:55,950
compete towards fulfilling the,
you know,

380
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,780
they compete towards the end game and 
that'll immediately produced a hierarchy

381
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,330
out of,
uh,

382
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,710
accomplishment,
let's say.

383
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,210
And then you might say,
well,

384
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,360
why would men be particularly motivated 
to do that?

385
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,194
And the answer seems to be because of 
hyper gummy and hypergo b is the 

386
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,900
tendency of women to make across her up 
dominance hierarchies.

387
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,943
So the males compete with one another 
and they want to because they want to 

388
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,364
win.
[inaudible] and part of the consequence 

389
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,110
of winning is that they have much more 
success with women.

390
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,450
And that's a primary motivator.
So,

391
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,420
so that's interesting because it,
it,

392
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,650
it provides a rationale for supporting a
relatively structured hierarchy that has

393
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,560
nothing to do with,
with,

394
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,703
you know,
having to deal with the negative 

395
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,810
consequences of not having a stable 
worldview.

396
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,950
It's more,
and you know,

397
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:44,860
there's another thing to think about to 
hear with regards to hierarchies.

398
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:49,390
It's like
if you have an ideal,

399
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,420
you immediately have a hierarch.
So if you,

400
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,313
because of course let's say that you 
have a bunch of children and gymnasium 

401
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,513
and you say,
well let's do somersaults to the other 

402
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,300
side of the wall.

403
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,313
You know,
there's an implication there and the 

404
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,790
implication is that you can be better or
worse at it.

405
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,673
So the kids will immediately compete,
especially the boys immediately compete 

406
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:13,240
to roll to the other side of the wall as
fast as they possibly can.

407
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,750
And so if you want it to get rid of 
hierarchy,

408
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,584
you'd have to get rid of values.
And that seems like a really stupid 

409
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,890
thing to do to me,
you know,

410
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,724
because without values,
you have no positive motivation because 

411
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:28,090
you feel almost all your positive 
motivation in relationship to a goal.

412
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,253
Right?
Because it's not attainment of the goal 

413
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,620
that makes people happy.
Generally speaking,

414
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,813
it's observation of the fact that their 
efforts are contributing to them moving 

415
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,730
towards a value goal.
So,

416
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
okay,
so there's masculine and independence.

417
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,394
That was one dimension.
Another dimension was basically 

418
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,144
religious traditionalism.
And then there was more women who were 

419
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,234
aligned with that,
which was interesting because we found 

420
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,350
more women on the far left of the 
spectrum too,

421
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,550
which I'll talk about in a minute.

422
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,190
So,
and then the last one was something like

423
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:59,500
ethnocentrism,
which is like,

424
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,060
you know,
if you're not like us,

425
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,310
go away basically.
And so,

426
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,970
but none of those were fiscal,
social or none of them.

427
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,310
None of those were fiscal or social.
So that was quite interesting.

428
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:12,040
And it also shows you the utility of 
getting your measurements right.

429
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,960
Because if you don't get your 
measurements right,

430
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,430
you don't even know what you're talking 
about.

431
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,503
And conservatism characterized along 
those three dimensions is a lot 

432
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,380
different than conservative as in 
characterized as fiscal versus social.

433
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,530
They're not the same phenomenon.
So,

434
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,373
okay.
So back to the industrious person 

435
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,230
carries out his or her plants wastes 
time.

436
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,350
Negative con industrious people don't 
waste time.

437
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,610
So they stay,
they stay focused on their goal or they,

438
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,650
they continue acting in relationship to 
the goal that's more accurate.

439
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,870
Finds it difficult to get down to work.

440
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,060
No,
that isn't characteristic of industrious

441
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,370
people.
And you can see the willpower element to

442
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,510
that to some degree.
You know,

443
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:01,511
you can tell yourself to sit down and 
work and you will so messes things up.

444
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,274
No,
that isn't what an industrious person 

445
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,580
does.
Finishes what he or she starts.

446
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:08,414
Yes.
Puts his or her mind on the task at 

447
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,264
hand.
So there seems to be an intentional 

448
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,700
phenomena there,
right?

449
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,570
Is the person is able to focus in 
without distractions.

450
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,060
Um,
gets things done quickly.

451
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,133
Well industrious people seem to be fans 
of efficiency and you can kind of see 

452
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,720
the relationship between efficiency in 
order.

453
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,703
Although you can also see at times where
the demand for more efficiency would 

454
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,784
require the disruption of a,
of something that was previously 

455
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,933
orderly.
So an industrious person and an orderly 

456
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,180
person might have a,
you know,

457
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,510
a dispute about that always knows what 
he or she is doing.

458
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,344
So that's again,
there's a kind of certainty and 

459
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,330
direction that's associated with that 
doesn't postpone decisions,

460
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,193
isn't easily distract and orderliness is
the big predictor of longterm life 

461
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,654
success.
Now orderliness is more predictive of 

462
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,493
success in jobs that require careful 
attention to the management of process 

463
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:01,424
so that if something has become 
something has been turned into an 

464
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,260
algorithm.
So that means there's a process by which

465
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:07,094
it might be done.
Then in order to be a person is very 

466
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,600
good at making sure that the,

467
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,150
that uh,
you know that,

468
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,330
that the algorithm runs exactly as it's 
supposed to without error.

469
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,433
You see,
conscientiousness actually has quite a 

470
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:21,534
good predictor of scientific 
productivity because one of the things 

471
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:24,924
that science does in large part is 
reduce the reliance on intelligence and 

472
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:33,000
increase the reliance on 
conscientiousness.

473
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,830
I mean that's one of its powers,
right?

474
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:39,030
Because you can be a not spectacularly 
bright scientists,

475
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:39,864
but if you're good at methodology and 
you're detail oriented and you know the 

476
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:46,320
literature,
you can figure out what the next problem

477
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:49,410
is to solve what's micro problem.
Cause you know where the problems are.

478
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:52,560
And then science is like a,
almost like a meat grinder.

479
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,240
You know,
if you turn the crank property,

480
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:56,700
you feed in raw information,
you turn the crank property,

481
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,460
you're going to make the next,
you know,

482
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,383
tiny step forward.
So it's maybe the more open scientists 

483
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:04,224
to leap way the hell into the future and
completely transform a field at the 

484
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,394
level of fundamental presupposition.
But most of the scientists are just 

485
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:14,550
nibbling on the edges between order and 
chaos.

486
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:16,050
And you know,
it's a whole monstrous,

487
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:19,080
massive,
the moving forward tiny amounts at once.

488
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,570
And so that's partly what makes science 
extremely powerful.

489
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,303
Okay.

490
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,110
We don't know why people are 
industrious,

491
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,843
we can't figure it out.
I have a sneaking suspicion I told you 

492
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,674
that maybe part of it is that they want 
to win within a defined framework and 

493
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:41,770
then that might be associated with 
hyperglycemia.

494
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,450
Now one of the things you see is that 
there is a gender difference between men

495
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,430
and women in relationship to 
conscientiousness,

496
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,533
not conscientiousness overall,
but women are more orderly than men and 

497
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,674
men are more industrious than women.
And that kind of goes along with the 

498
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:55,704
hyper gummy.
So you remember high pergamum he has 

499
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:01,350
this tendency that I described already.
It's the case had many,

500
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,620
many among many,
many types of creature.

501
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,030
Um,
so there might be that as a motivation,

502
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:09,864
although I don't,
I don't think that you can simply say 

503
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,750
that men think that if they get 
successful,

504
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,720
they're going to have more luck with 
women.

505
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,680
Although that's certainly a conscious 
realization on the part of many men.

506
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,570
I think it's such a deep phenomena 
though that it's bill,

507
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:29,430
it's more like it's built into the 
motivational system a priority,

508
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,300
you know,
so anyways,

509
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,840
so that would go on the masculine 
independence front.

510
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,733
But,
but we still haven't been able to 

511
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,780
manipulate that with any,
to any great degree.

512
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Maybe we're thinking as well that what 
conscientious people are doing is not so

513
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:53,541
much striving to get to the talk as they
are trying really hard to stay away from

514
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,940
the bottom and now would go along with 
the,

515
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,800
with the orderliness,
industriousness overlap,

516
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,060
you know,
say if,

517
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,613
if,
um,

518
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,700
part of what makes you orderly and 
somewhat industrious is disgust,

519
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:11,340
sensitivity.
One of the things that you might want to

520
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,174
do is flee from the bottom of dominance 
hierarchies because the bottom of the 

521
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,034
dominance hierarchy is a bad place to be
from the perspective of maintenance of 

522
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:21,510
health.

523
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,343
Like people at the bottom of dominance,
hierarchies are generally speaking in 

524
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,410
much rougher shape than the people who 
are closer to the talk.

525
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:32,160
And so part of being industriousness 
might want,

526
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,023
might be maybe you're motivated by not 
wanting to fail and then you might 

527
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,280
think,
well that's anxiety,

528
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,960
but maybe not,
you know,

529
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,123
conscientious people.
Let's say you have someone walking down 

530
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,570
the street and they encounter a homeless
person.

531
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,673
Okay.
Is a conscientious person more or less 

532
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:49,524
likely to give the conscientious person 
money or give the homeless person to 

533
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,850
give the homeless person money?
What do you think?

534
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
No,
that's right.

535
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,680
No agreeable person that they'll give 
the person money.

536
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:03,360
The conscientious first and especially 
the,

537
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:06,770
wasn't that sort of hyper orderly or say
get a job.

538
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,770
And they do that because conscientious 
people are also more judgmental.

539
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,680
And that goes along with,
with,

540
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,380
uh,
the hierarchical attitude.

541
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,250
I think they,
you know,

542
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:18,084
they genuinely run on the principal,
but being higher up in the hierarchy is 

543
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:25,560
better and that there's something wrong 
with you from a moral perspective if you

544
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,640
happen to be,
you know,

545
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,474
among the failures.
And so one possibility is that part of 

546
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,374
the reason that conscientious people,
industrious people are that way is 

547
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:34,584
because they judge themselves quite 
harshly and they really do not want to 

548
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:39,660
fail.
But it's not because they're anxious,

549
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:40,494
it's because they're disgusted self 
disgusted by the possibility that they 

550
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:45,274
might count among the failures.
And so that grounded it in an entirely 

551
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:54,841
different motivational system.
So now there's some other things about

552
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,850
how about conscientiousness that are 
pretty interesting.

553
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,940
I think they're kind of revolutionarily.
Interesting.

554
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,150
So the first thing I told you was that 
overall,

555
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,450
especially for industries,
to us,

556
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:11,410
we have no theoretical model,
no neuropsychological bottle,

557
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,500
no psychological model and no 
pharmacological model.

558
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,513
I could add to that no animal model.
So that's pretty damn weird because 

559
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,033
pretty,
pretty.

560
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,873
Almost always when you discover 
something psychometrically and it's 

561
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:24,964
stable,
you can start connecting it to other 

562
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,180
things that you've discovered.
Like,

563
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,014
you know,
extroversion is associated with 

564
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,814
incentive reward and neuroticism is 
associated with the anxiety systems and 

565
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,673
you know,
stability looks like it's associated 

566
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,450
with higher levels of Serotonin and 
openness looks like it's associated with

567
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:45,451
decreased latent inhibition.
Like we know we've got some insight into

568
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,810
what's going on at other levels of 
analysis with regards to these traits.

569
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,530
Conscientiousness,
no,

570
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,710
except for this connection between 
orderliness and discussed.

571
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,470
Yes.
He's like,

572
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,420
well that's a good question.
Are there conscientious animals?

573
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,740
You know,
that's a tough one.

574
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,030
You might say yes because sled dogs and 
that sort of thing and,

575
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:12,540
and like Australian blue heelers,
first of all,

576
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,580
they're super intelligence.

577
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,330
So that is something to take into 
account.

578
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,910
But they also really seem to like to 
work.

579
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,510
But I would say they're probably more 
enthusiastic than conscientious,

580
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,460
you know,
cause they love to work.

581
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,840
They're out,
they're wagging their tail.

582
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,600
It's like that's not what you're doing 
when you're doing telephone sales.

583
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,860
You know?
So yeah,

584
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,080
but
like sort of like this idea of some kind

585
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:37,100
of value,
more gentlemen indicted in Ibm.

586
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,370
So I don't think animals has this kind 
of,

587
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,490
whenever more rude.
Well,

588
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,250
it's not obvious like,
because if you look at chimpanzees,

589
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,850
for example,
um,

590
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,063
the chimpanzees and other primates,
they have pretty stable dominance 

591
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,970
hierarchies there actually hereditary 
and the,

592
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,103
the top primates are pretty rough on the
bottom primates and a lot of it looks 

593
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,530
like contempt.
So,

594
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,660
you know,
because what else would it be?

595
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,800
Exactly.
You know.

596
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,190
But by the same token,
it's not that easy to generate an animal

597
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,330
model of disgust.

598
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,130
That's another problem.
Well,

599
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,390
I mean,
you think about dogs,

600
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,670
those bloody things,
they're not disgusted by anything.

601
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,983
You know,
they're enthusiastic about lots of 

602
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,710
things that no,
nothing in its right mind should ever be

603
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:24,560
enthusiastic about.
So anyway,

604
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:25,270
so,
okay,

605
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,040
so
all right.

606
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,650
So overall,
if you're conscientious,

607
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,810
you're going to be more satisfied with 
your life,

608
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:37,900
especially as you've progressed through 
time and you're going to be more,

609
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,890
more happy,
you're going to be happier.

610
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,240
Which is funny because of course 
happiness is basically extroversion.

611
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,360
So you might ask what does that have to 
do with conscientiousness?

612
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,194
But what it seems to happen is that 
because of your conscientious across 

613
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:50,924
time,
your life actually stabilizes and gets 

614
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:56,090
better.
And so even though you might not be more

615
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:57,680
happy,
you'll be less miserable.

616
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:58,514
And they'll tell you if you give people 
a choice between les miserable and 

617
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:03,890
happier,
they'll take less miserable because it's

618
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:05,420
really painful to be miserable.

619
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,740
But it's only so it's only moderately 
good to be happy.

620
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,873
We have a much bigger capacity for 
negative emotion then for positive 

621
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:13,934
emotion.
So it's positively related to life 

622
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:18,614
satisfaction and happiness,
but it's also positively related to 

623
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:21,914
depression.
Conscientious people are more likely to 

624
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:24,314
get depressed now.
So there's part of the reason why there 

625
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,330
might be some variation.
Conscientiousness.

626
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,820
So you might say,
well conscientious people do really well

627
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:32,654
when they're fully employed,
but if you fire someone who's 

628
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:36,044
conscientious,
they do not have a good time with it 

629
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,224
because the judgmental part of their 
personality starts to wreak havoc with 

630
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,260
themselves.
You know,

631
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,790
because their attitude is if you work 
hard,

632
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,410
you can get ahead.
Right?

633
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,244
And so that's an index.
Your success is an index of your moral 

634
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,430
value,
essentially.

635
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,650
Well,
so then you lose your,

636
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,783
your employment.
What the hell are you supposed to 

637
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:57,704
conclude?

638
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,813
Well,
you couldn't conclude that the whole 

639
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,244
system is rotten,
but you're very unlikely to do that if 

640
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,750
you're conscientious cause you're sort 
of a patriotic type and,

641
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,560
and you know,
you,

642
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,393
you are,
you identify quite strongly with the 

643
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,420
structure of the system.
And plus,

644
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,703
you know,
conscientious people are very concerned 

645
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,400
with justice and they might think,
well,

646
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,340
if I'm going to have this attitude 
towards other people who failed,

647
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,570
you know,
who are unemployed,

648
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:23,150
let's say I have to have the same 
attitude towards me.

649
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:25,160
And so what you see with conscientious 
people,

650
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,100
if they're having,
you know,

651
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,943
maybe they've got laid off at work 
really through absolutely no fault of 

652
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:31,904
their own,
they are just torn up by it because one 

653
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:36,734
of the things they do that's different 
for an unconscientious first and 

654
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,460
everything is always someone else's 
fault.

655
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,200
But for a conscientious person,
it's the opposite.

656
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,050
And everything is always their fault.
Well,

657
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,690
the problem,
there's an advantage to that a cause.

658
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:50,360
If you take responsibility for your 
situation,

659
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:55,361
then there's a possibility that you'll 
make whatever changes you can to improve

660
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,680
your situation.
You know?

661
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,700
So even if you're only 10% at fault,
if you take responsibility for that,

662
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,260
then you can fix that 10% and maybe 
things will work out better for you.

663
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,483
So you know,
there's some advantages to 

664
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:11,240
overestimating the degree to which 
you're at fault.

665
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:11,991
And if you say,
well,

666
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:13,460
it's the system,
well,

667
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,670
okay,
good,

668
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,890
fine,
go fix that.

669
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,753
Like it's not going to happen.
So it's not a very effective means of 

670
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:22,670
coping,
but in psychotic depression,

671
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,200
for example,
which is a very,

672
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,950
very extreme form of depression,
what you often see is that the depressed

673
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:28,784
person erroneously concludes,
it's like a metaphysical conclusion 

674
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,920
almost that their faults are integrally 
tied to the,

675
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,720
you know,
to everything that happens that's bad in

676
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,554
the world.

677
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,330
And so they take on all of the guilt for
everything that's gone wrong.

678
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:46,164
And obviously that's,
there's a point at which that's a 

679
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,640
relatively counterproductive conclusion,
you know,

680
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,140
especially because often when bad things
happen to you in life,

681
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,350
there's a random element and you know,
you can't really treat yourself properly

682
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,290
unless you take that random element into
account.

683
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,750
Now you can overestimate it,
which is what you do.

684
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,240
If you're under,
I'm unconscientious and you could,

685
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,080
could overestimate it if you're 
unconscientious and underestimated,

686
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,320
if you're conscientious and there's 
going to be times when you paid for both

687
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,300
of those attitudes.
So anyways,

688
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,610
conscientious people don't do very well 
when they're,

689
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,310
when they're not doing very well because
they,

690
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,590
they,
they judge themselves very harshly.

691
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,450
And so that's partly what,
and it's related to guilt.

692
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,973
It's not a hat.
It's a funny thing because there's an 

693
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:37,140
element of guilt that's associated with 
conscientiousness too.

694
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,190
So conscientious people feel guilt less 
often,

695
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,200
but they're more sensitive to it.

696
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,880
So,
and then you think,

697
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:48,550
well that's kind of paradoxical.
It's not exactly paradoxical.

698
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,384
If you're sensitive to guilt,
you might arrange things so that you 

699
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:51,904
have nothing to feel guilty about.
And that's what conscientious people 

700
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:57,490
seem to do.
And so guilt,

701
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,853
guilt and shame seemed to be emotions 
that are integrity associated with 

702
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:06,670
conscientiousness and they're kind of 
difficult to disentangle it,

703
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,623
you know?
And maybe they're not even really 

704
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,830
separate things.
But shame seems to be something that you

705
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,860
feel when you fail,
perhaps in the eyes of others.

706
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:15,694
And guilt is something that you feel 
when you fail according to your own 

707
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:19,594
standards.
And I know that that's kind of a messy 

708
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:21,844
definition,
but conscientious people do seem to be 

709
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,294
more prone to shame and guilt.
And those seem to be in principle 

710
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,333
mediated by different systems than the 
systems that mediate anxiety and 

711
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,090
emotional pain.
But we don't know what the systems are.

712
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Now you can also think about it
in relationship to something,

713
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:44,600
you know what to what the 
existentialists called,

714
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:47,360
like the existential burden.
So you know,

715
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,590
people are always doing things in 
groups.

716
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,550
The groups are often oriented to,
to produce a certain outcome,

717
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:00,384
like a hunting party.
We could say that if we're thinking of 

718
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:03,940
it from an evolutionary perspective,
like there's it,

719
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,373
there's a goal and it's an important 
goal and they're going to be good 

720
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:10,740
hunters and hundreds of that aren't so 
good.

721
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,143
And

722
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,513
part of the way,
and this is to think of a hierarchy as 

723
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:17,964
something other than a dominance 
hierarchy because the dominance 

724
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:23,190
hierarchy theory is slightly flawed 
because it implies that the hierarchy is

725
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:25,020
only based on power.
Right?

726
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:25,854
But that's not right.
Like if you have a hunting party or a 

727
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:33,420
building crew or anything like that,
a lot of what elevates one man above the

728
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,440
other in the dominance hierarchy isn't 
power.

729
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:37,150
It's competence,
you know?

730
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:37,984
So the best hunter has the highest 
reputation or the best builder has the 

731
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,614
highest reputation or you know,
it depends on what the hierarchy is 

732
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:44,734
devoted for,
but the person who's best at that rises 

733
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,410
to the top,
you know,

734
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,110
all other things being equal.
And that's often the case.

735
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:51,970
Even if people don't like them very 
much.

736
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,580
You know,
we've done investigations into corporate

737
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,414
structures where someone will be 
approved by a relatively large majority 

738
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,160
of the people who worked for the company
because they're hyper competent,

739
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,290
but no one really likes,
you know?

740
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,320
And so you can't really think of that 
as,

741
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,170
as you know,
either a popularity contest or something

742
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:12,004
that's based on power.
And I think that a decent hierarchies 

743
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:17,800
almost never based on power,
based on competence.

744
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,820
Now those two things get tangled up,
but well,

745
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,720
so then you think one of the things 
that's going to make people

746
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,323
prone to being successful is to feel 
some responsibility in relationship to 

747
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,740
their capacity to attain a goal in a 
group situation.

748
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
And I think that's partly the origin of 
both conscientiousness and guilt and 

749
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,290
shame.
You know,

750
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,333
lots of times if you talk to unemployed 
people and you know we hear a lot about 

751
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:52,110
rates of depression and that sort of 
thing,

752
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:54,610
but what kind of boneheaded about the 
way we measure things?

753
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:58,090
Like if you want to be depressed,
the best thing to do is lose your job.

754
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,380
And then you really got to ask yourself,
are you depressed or are you unemployed?

755
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,240
You know,
those aren't the same thing.

756
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,620
You know?
And you might say,

757
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:08,590
well for some people unemployment 
doesn't make them depressed.

758
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,101
It's like,
well,

759
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:09,934
we know that that's the unconscientious 
people or maybe the unconscientious 

760
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,080
people and the emotionally stable 
people,

761
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:17,620
something like that.
But for the people who are conscientious

762
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,740
and also maybe somewhat neurotic man 
that's just going to wipe them out.

763
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,890
But to think about that as psychological
is rather foolish.

764
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,233
You know,
it's,

765
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,530
it's an actual loss and they're 
responding to it in an actual way.

766
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,740
And so,
you know,

767
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,783
and usually people who are unemployed,
I mean part of the reason that they get 

768
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,530
depressed is because they're worried 
about their future,

769
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,930
you know?
But that's not the only reason.

770
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,410
What they often talk about is that 
they've let people down.

771
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,483
So that'd be people in their family or 
they let themselves down or they're 

772
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,633
performing underneath their capacity or 
they're just useless and aren't 

773
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,324
contributing.

774
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,570
And those are all places where,
you know,

775
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,423
their guilt will start to eat them up.
And those are the sorts of things that 

776
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:00,430
seem also to be associated with 
conscientiousness.

777
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,563
It's like the idea that you know,
you're part of a team of sled dogs in 

778
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:06,304
your,
you have a responsibility to pull your 

779
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:10,030
weight and if you're not pulling your 
weight,

780
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:11,920
then there's something contemptible 
about you.

781
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:15,010
And if you happen to be one of those 
people who aren't pulling their weight,

782
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,750
then there's something contemptible 
about you,

783
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,673
even if it's you making the judgment.
So and conscientious people are 

784
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,140
definitely more judgmental.
So for example,

785
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,363
if you read them,
if you tell them stories about people 

786
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,384
who performed various criminal and cause
I criminal acts and you get them to 

787
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:36,530
estimate the sentence that they should 
be subjected to the conscientious people

788
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,930
will reliably,
you know,

789
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,420
put people in prison for longer periods 
of time.

790
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,313
They don't like violations of,
they don't like violations of norms or 

791
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:48,680
violations of rules and so and so,
you know,

792
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:49,514
so one of the reasons that people might 
bet there might be a distribution and 

793
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,670
conscientiousness is like maybe when the
whole economy collapses,

794
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:56,504
which happens fairly frequently,
the conscientious people just wipe 

795
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:00,530
themselves out.
You know,

796
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,393
they're so depressed and so self 
judgemental and so crushed that they 

797
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,730
can't handle the,
that you know,

798
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,900
the,
what would you call that?

799
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,500
That's the very,
yeah,

800
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:13,580
it's variability.
That's not the word I was looking for.

801
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,130
So they get clipped off when things 
fail.

802
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,200
Co I'm conscientious person doesn't 
really care.

803
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,034
And that's actually sort of almost like 
the defining characteristic of an 

804
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,380
unconscientious person is they don't 
really care.

805
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,850
And that's an interesting thing too,
because it's often more fun to be around

806
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:29,684
unconscientious people than it is to be,
you're unconscientious people because 

807
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,380
it's very hard to relax around people 
who are really orderly and judgmental.

808
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,440
You know,
you can't even sit improperly or you get

809
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:41,990
judged for it.
Whereas if you're in someone's house and

810
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:43,970
they're unconscientious,
you know,

811
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,980
and you throw your beer can on the 
floor,

812
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,050
they'll just laugh and throw their beer 
camera,

813
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,030
you know?
And so that's,

814
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,680
I think it's difficult to relax with,
with really hyper conscientious people.

815
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,570
It's probably difficult to have fun with
them.

816
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,180
I think it's difficult for them to 
relax.

817
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,190
You know,
they,

818
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,530
they tend like conservative people tend 
to read less,

819
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,850
you know?
And you might think,

820
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,684
well,
that might be associated with their 

821
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:10,430
interest in intellectual activity 
because they're also lower and openness.

822
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,480
But I think it's also because they 
regard reading as a waste of time,

823
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,230
not because they exactly regard reading 
as a waste of time,

824
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,890
but they feel guilty if they're not 
working and instead they're sitting down

825
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,724
reading of us,
what are you doing sitting down reading 

826
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:24,531
a book?
You know,

827
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:29,120
there's work to be done.
And so they're very work oriented.

828
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,650
So,
okay,

829
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,350
orderliness is a good predictor of 
conservatism,

830
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,140
as we've already said.
And it's associated with disgust,

831
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:44,230
sensitivity,
and preference for order and tradition,

832
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,320
not egalitarianism.
So then you think,

833
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:50,020
well,
where's the egalitarian motivations?

834
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:52,740
And they all seem to pile up pretty much
on agreeableness.

835
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,570
So the conscientious people basically 
say,

836
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:59,320
you can get ahead if you play the game 
properly and you abide by the rules that

837
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:02,050
and you work.
And the agreeable people say,

838
00:44:02,051 --> 00:44:02,531
well,
yeah,

839
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,780
but there's lots of people who can't 
really manage that.

840
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:05,614
And you know,
we're not just going to push them off a 

841
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,080
cliff.
They need to be taken care of.

842
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:11,200
And you know,
the situation wasn't fair to begin with.

843
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,513
You know,
and,

844
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,930
and there's a battle between that all 
the time.

845
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:15,764
And there's a battle because 
agreeableness and conscientiousness are 

846
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,193
orthogonal,
which means that they actually traverse 

847
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,250
different ethics,
right?

848
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,800
And they're not opposites on the 
continuum,

849
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,450
conscientiousness and agreeableness.

850
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,280
That's not it at all.
So,

851
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,330
and it looks like in order for,
you know,

852
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,670
in order for people to adjust to the 
world of human beings,

853
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,320
you have to be agreeable to some measure
and you have to be conscientious to some

854
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,570
measure.
And the question is how much of each,

855
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,330
and the answer is,
well it depends on the circumstances and

856
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:48,390
where you place yourself.
But at the same question applies to the,

857
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,483
to the polity at large,
how agreeable should it be versus how 

858
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,260
conscientious should it be?
And that's a very,

859
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:56,011
very,
it's,

860
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:56,844
it's not a problem with a solution.
The solution is only to be derived from 

861
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:01,854
a continual dialogue say between the 
conscientious people and the agreeable 

862
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:05,544
people.
Because the answer varies as the 

863
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:08,934
environment varies.
So you can't come up with an end 

864
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:14,610
solution to that problem.
So,

865
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,060
okay.

866
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,950
You know,
the conscientious people,

867
00:45:18,951 --> 00:45:20,540
so we'll say the conservatives for 
there,

868
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,230
for the sake of argument,
they liked hierarchies.

869
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:25,064
They like order,
they like a game that everyone can play 

870
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:32,731
and some people can win and they make 
the assumption that if you play properly

871
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,240
and you win,
but that,

872
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:38,870
that you've done something good.
Well,

873
00:45:38,871 --> 00:45:41,900
the problem is is that if you steepen up
the hierarchy enough,

874
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,633
no one gets to climb it and then the 
whole bloody society starts to crumble 

875
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:48,720
and breakdown because the rates of 
violence go way up.

876
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:49,554
So you can see there's a,
there's an upper bound to the steepness 

877
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:53,960
of a hierarchy.
And so you might say,

878
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:54,794
well,
that's where conscientiousness hits 

879
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,220
limit hits its limit.
Or You could even say that's where merit

880
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,720
meritocracy hypothetically hits its 
limit.

881
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,330
Because you know,
if you're intelligent and conscientious,

882
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:07,880
you're much more likely to rise to the 
top of a hierarchy.

883
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,530
Well,
fine.

884
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,663
Maybe you want smart,
hardworking people at the top of 

885
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,910
structures.
But if,

886
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,820
if it's steep like this,
well then,

887
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,380
okay,

888
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,180
there's a point at which that isn't 
sustainable.

889
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,880
And so the hierarchy has to be flat and 
somehow,

890
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,230
you know,
no one.

891
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,570
But the problem is,
and that's also something that agreeable

892
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:29,070
people would say right off the bat.
It's like,

893
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:32,310
what about the strata at the bottom or 
just above the bottom?

894
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,833
How are you going to ensure that they 
don't fall right out of the game 

895
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,520
altogether,
which is a perfectly reasonable,

896
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,760
a reasonable question and answer to 
that,

897
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:44,040
both those questions as well.
We don't know how to do that.

898
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,250
And so we're trying to solve that 
problem continually as we go along.

899
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,590
So orderly people also have harsh 
judgments and moral transgressions.

900
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:53,424
We talked about that.
Now there's an idea of a behavioral 

901
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:57,360
immune system here.
Now this is a cool,

902
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,733
cool

903
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,283
idea.

904
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,743
So disgust is considered to be one of 
the basic human emotions defined by a 

905
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:17,460
strong repulsion and desire to withdraw 
from and the listening stimulus or event

906
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,313
physically disgust as a company by a 
distinct facial expression involving 

907
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,270
constriction of the oral and nasal 
cavities.

908
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:27,630
So it's something like that to close 
yourself off.

909
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,590
Evolutionary of people make that face 
when they hear a dirty joke that they're

910
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:36,430
really quite offended by evolutionary 
models of disgust.

911
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,560
Propose that it's emotion helped to 
evolve,

912
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,150
evolve to help us avoid contaminated or 
harmful foods or other potential sources

913
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:47,140
of disease such as sexual contact.
Now that's interesting.

914
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:49,750
You know,
because there's also an idea that floats

915
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:50,584
around the general culture and I think 
it's be more elaborated upon partly 

916
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:54,814
since the time of Freud by particularly 
since the 60s that sexual disgust is 

917
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:01,570
culturally produced.
It's like you can just drop that idea.

918
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,703
It's not the case at all any more than 
discussed related to food is culturally 

919
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:07,780
produced,
cultural moves it.

920
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,340
But the disgust response to sexual 
contact and to food is extremely,

921
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,160
uh,
powerful innately.

922
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:15,994
And you know that because otherwise 
everyone would always be sleeping with 

923
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,230
everyone else.
Like there has to,

924
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,160
because obviously sexual contact is a 
primary motivator.

925
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,233
Well,
something has to regulate it and you 

926
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,570
might say,
well good sense is what should regulate.

927
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:29,051
It's like,
yeah,

928
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,070
right man,
good sense,

929
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:32,890
doesn't regulate good sense,
doesn't regulate anything.

930
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,263
And so there's no way that's going to 
happen is the regulator for sexual 

931
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,374
behavior.
And that's grounded in contempt and 

932
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:40,261
disgust,
you know?

933
00:48:40,261 --> 00:48:41,094
And we saw a lot of that in the parts of
the crumb video that we watched because 

934
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:48,970
the crumb brothers were always being the
targets of contempt and disgust.

935
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,560
So that's pretty rough.
But you know,

936
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,420
you got to think about why that is too.

937
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,480
It's sexually transmitted.
Diseases are no joke.

938
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,823
You know,
and we don't know how long human beings 

939
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:58,654
have been plagued by them.
But you can presume that it's pretty 

940
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,440
much since the beginning of time.
You know,

941
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,800
I mean syphilis was important from the 
new world to the old world and was very,

942
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,144
very hard on Europe.
It was one of the reasons that the 

943
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:14,110
victorians were so strict in their 
sexual behavior.

944
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:14,944
The syphilis was a nasty disease until 
we've more or less finally brought it 

945
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:21,250
under control.
It's quite susceptible to antibiotics.

946
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,271
And it was,
you know,

947
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:25,330
transmissible to infants,
which is also a major catastrophe.

948
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,000
And then of course aids,
which was,

949
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:28,863
you know,
the primary vector for the spread of 

950
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,810
aids was promiscuity and the virus 
evolved.

951
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,510
Capitalize on promiscuity cause it does 
that and you know,

952
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,500
that could easily wiped us out.
Wiped out tens of millions of people.

953
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,030
And so,
you know,

954
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:45,520
we're pretty smart and got it under 
control pretty fast.

955
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,353
But you know,
in some ways it could have easily been 

956
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,653
otherwise.
And also AIDS turned out to be not that 

957
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,140
easy to catch.
You know,

958
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:53,974
you actually had to engage in sexual 
contact and generally you had to engage 

959
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,850
in sexual contact of a relatively 
nonstandard type because the,

960
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,200
the most typically used tissues are more
robust to the probability of infection.

961
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,690
So we have any,
any number of,

962
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,610
of,
there's any number of reasons for people

963
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:18,700
to be disgusted by sexual contact.
So,

964
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,453
and that's something that has to be 
contended with in addition to its role 

965
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,600
in directly helping to expel harmful 
foods from the body.

966
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,180
Discussed also forms an component of the
behavioral immune system,

967
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,463
the suite of psychological mechanisms 
that aid in the detection and avoidance 

968
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:37,580
of potential contaminants before they 
can make contact with the body.

969
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,190
Yeah,

970
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,070
so there's the immune system,
right?

971
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,870
It attacks invading pathogens,
but there's an analog in your behavior,

972
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:49,330
which is that you're unlikely to 
approach,

973
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,710
touch and consume anything that happens 
to be disgusting.

974
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,990
And it's a weird system.
So for example,

975
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,363
um,
people are unlikely to want to touch a 

976
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:01,144
sterilized cockroach.
And I don't mean one that's unable to 

977
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,001
breathe,
you know,

978
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:04,834
I mean one that that's being treated but
heated so that it's free of 

979
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,640
contaminants.
People don't like to do that.

980
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:12,040
They won't eat and this will hardly come
as any surprise.

981
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,150
High quality chocolate molded to 
resemble dog feces.

982
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,930
Okay,
so and everyone laughs about that.

983
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:20,764
Right.
Which is kind of an interesting 

984
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,144
response.
So like of course no one would do that 

985
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,100
well,
right,

986
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,933
exactly know.
Although you cannot attribute that to 

987
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:28,174
logic,
you can just attribute to the fact that 

988
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:31,414
you know that if you are in that 
situation how you would feel and the 

989
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:37,300
first thing you would feel is certainly 
not hungry and then turn it off.

990
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:39,010
Which is an interesting way of thinking 
about it.

991
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,360
They,
because it turned off,

992
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:44,590
it's essentially a sexual expression 
turned off and then you'd feel,

993
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:49,900
I think you'd feel like a moron so to 
speak if you ate it right it to yourself

994
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,730
and to anybody who also happened to be 
around.

995
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:53,860
There would be something about self 
contamination,

996
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,903
voluntary self contamination there that 
would make you appear really not very 

997
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,420
admirable or honorable.
It's something like that.

998
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,480
So no,
the question becomes,

999
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:05,314
and this is where things get tricky,
just exactly what should you be 

1000
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:08,990
disgusted,
Bart.

1001
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,383
Okay,

1002
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,430
so here's another example.
So if you get people to spit into a,

1003
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,130
to,
you know,

1004
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,963
to put saliva into a cup,
they will not take it back in their 

1005
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:21,830
mouth,
don't you think?

1006
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:23,440
Well that's kind of strange too.
It's like,

1007
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,010
you know,
with the cup is sterilized,

1008
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:25,710
we'll say,
you know what?

1009
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,290
Sterilized while it was just in your 
mouth,

1010
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,530
like half a second before,
what the Hell is wrong with it now?

1011
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,470
And the answer is it's no longer in your
mouth.

1012
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:34,820
And you know,
so there's an,

1013
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,803
there's an identification of the 
exterior of the body envelope as one of 

1014
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:42,200
the things that defines you and not you.
And you know,

1015
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,034
the immune system per se,
it was always defining you and not you 

1016
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,530
getting rid of things that aren't you 
and keeping the things that are you.

1017
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:52,280
And that's extended out to our behavior.
So you can get,

1018
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,700
here's the sorts of things that Jonathan
Haidt has been,

1019
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,973
uh,
discovering hate was really the guy who 

1020
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:01,310
did the first major work on discussed.

1021
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,450
It's a big deal,
man.

1022
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:04,230
Like two thumbs up for him.
Um,

1023
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,260
he's discovered something genuine 
inducing disgust responses,

1024
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:11,420
whether via a fall order,
a dis odor,

1025
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,313
a disgusting work environment,
or we calling it disgusting experience 

1026
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,763
led individuals to assign harsher 
punishments to others who had committed 

1027
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:19,934
moral transgressions.
So that's interesting because what it 

1028
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,410
also means is that the sense of 
discussing,

1029
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,393
at least in part,
is that the core of what we might 

1030
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:32,211
describe as our desire for justice.
So which we tend to think as a primary,

1031
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:33,064
that cognitive thing,
but most of the things that we do and 

1032
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:39,690
hold dear are not primarily cognitive.
They're grounded in,

1033
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:40,903
you know,
phenomena that are deeply embedded 

1034
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:44,484
within us.
Harsh moral judgments can even be 

1035
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:50,220
induced following the consumption of a 
bitter drink.

1036
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,910
Well,
poisoning this things are often bitter,

1037
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,030
even though bitter things are sometimes 
not poisons.

1038
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,863
And the bitter flavor evokes,
discussed the same disgust related 

1039
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:05,310
facial expressions or observed in 
response to unpleasant tastes.

1040
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,290
Disgusting photographs and receiving 
unfair treatment in an economic game.

1041
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,780
So that basically means that if you're 
playing,

1042
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:16,500
imagine some kids are playing together 
and one of the kids cheats,

1043
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,693
or you might say,
well the other kids are going to be 

1044
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:20,340
angry,
or they other kids are going to be upset

1045
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,174
or the other kids are going to be 
anxious because they've upset the 

1046
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:23,700
structure of the game.
It's like,

1047
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:25,290
okay,
maybe all those things happen,

1048
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,500
but one thing that happens as well as 
discussed,

1049
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,040
it's like how could you do that?
And then of course if you're disgusting,

1050
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,023
the probability that you're going to get
shunted out of the dominance hierarchy 

1051
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,290
all together,
it's pretty damn high.

1052
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,130
Concerns about cleanliness and feelings 
of disgust have likewise been related to

1053
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:43,964
political attitudes,
situational reminders of the importance 

1054
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:48,044
of physical cleanliness,
such as asking participants to wipe 

1055
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:51,554
their hands with antiseptic wipes tends 
to increase self-reported political 

1056
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:56,114
conservatism.
Such a finding is consistent with the 

1057
00:54:59,061 --> 00:54:59,894
notion that purity tends to be valued 
more highly by conservatives then by 

1058
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:08,240
liberals.
Well for much of human history,

1059
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,123
female virginity in particular was 
highly valued and sometimes the 

1060
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:18,470
punishments for deviating from that were
and still can be extraordinarily high.

1061
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,360
Well part of the reason why you might 
ask why precisely is that,

1062
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:27,410
and part of the reason is an exaggerated
disgust response.

1063
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,623
Individuals who report being disgusted 
more easily also tend to hold more 

1064
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,080
conservative political views on topics 
including abortion,

1065
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:37,280
gay marriage,
tax cuts,

1066
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:38,114
and affirmative action.
In addition to the effects that have 

1067
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,010
emerged when using self reported disgust
sensitivity,

1068
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,023
more conservative political views have 
also been associated with stronger 

1069
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:49,820
physiological reactivity to disgusting 
images.

1070
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:05,883
Yeah.
So preferences for order and tradition 

1071
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:12,010
on the one hand in preferences for 
egalitarianism on the other appear to be

1072
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,200
taking be related to two core dimensions
of moral value.

1073
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,143
So the um,
preferences for order and tradition are 

1074
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:22,690
associated with higher levels of 
orderliness and

1075
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,233
as well as lower levels of openness and 
intellect and preferences for 

1076
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:28,444
egalitarianism are uniquely associated 
with compassion and aspect of 

1077
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:32,380
agreeableness.

1078
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,403
Political conservatism.
Now this is where the claims get 

1079
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:38,883
frightening.
I think political conservatism can be 

1080
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:41,824
thought of as a social immune system 
reflecting the extension of pathogen 

1081
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:49,210
avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of
the social system just as the behavioral

1082
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:50,044
immune system has been conceptualized as
helping to maintain the purity and 

1083
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,644
integrity of an individual body.
So to me the same pathogen avoidance 

1084
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,454
system helped me in the abstract 
integrity of the social order in 

1085
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,294
particular to the social immune system 
would help to maintain order by 

1086
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:04,264
suppressing any actions or individuals 
that deviate from a group's accepted 

1087
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:09,760
social traditions.
Okay.

1088
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,780
Now we're going to make a bit of a segue
here from this.

1089
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,850
It has been reported,
for instance,

1090
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:19,720
that that regions with higher levels of 
disease prevalence tend to be associated

1091
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:23,050
with higher levels of social conformity 
and autocratic rule.

1092
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,890
Individuals who feel more vulnerable to 
disease likewise report higher levels of

1093
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:28,560
ethnocentrism,
xenophobia,

1094
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,820
no,
that's something else to consider.

1095
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,700
So,
I don't know if you know this,

1096
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:39,330
but when the Spaniards landed in Central
America,

1097
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,193
they had

1098
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,820
being from a European population that 
was punched and traded in cities,

1099
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,940
and the cities were,
from our perspective,

1100
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,013
disgusting,
filthy close proximity with animals and 

1101
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,180
subject to continual waves of epidemic 
disease.

1102
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,730
Now,
the upside of that for the Europeans was

1103
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:02,564
that all the ones that didn't die 
developed immunity to these various 

1104
00:58:06,261 --> 00:58:07,790
diseases even know,
you know,

1105
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:13,520
I would suspect that over time it was 
the majority of people who died from one

1106
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:16,400
epidemic disease or another.
Well,

1107
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:19,580
so then the Spaniards went to the new 
world.

1108
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,550
Well,
for one reason or another,

1109
00:58:22,551 --> 00:58:25,160
there were hardly any epidemic diseases 
in North America.

1110
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:25,994
Now,
that was partly because of a relative 

1111
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,004
dearth of domestic animals and partly 
because there weren't as many big 

1112
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:32,540
closely packed cities.
But you know,

1113
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:35,030
God only knows what the overall reason 
was.

1114
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,680
So what happened?

1115
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,410
Yeah,

1116
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:42,400
all the native Americans died.
95% of them.

1117
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,730
They died from smallpox.
They died from measles.

1118
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,410
They died from mumps.
Hey,

1119
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:52,150
guide from chicken pox in successive 
waves of epidemic,

1120
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:57,060
demolish mint centered in Central 
American rating.

1121
00:58:57,061 --> 00:58:58,930
I would all across North American,
South America,

1122
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,810
so that by the time the Europeans landed
in,

1123
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:04,840
because the Spaniards got there,
say in the late 14 hundreds right,

1124
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:09,010
early 15 hundreds and so the,
the people who landed at Plymouth Rock,

1125
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:09,844
and that's kind of often what you think 
about as the beginning of the European 

1126
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,600
colonization of North America.
That was like a hundred years later.

1127
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,730
Well,
everyone was dead by then.

1128
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,320
And their reports that when the,
when the,

1129
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,700
when the white settlers,
that religious escapees really landed at

1130
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,060
Plymouth Rock,
the data's,

1131
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,913
we're happy to see them because there 
weren't enough people left bringing in 

1132
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:30,423
the crops.

1133
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,090
So,
so why am I telling you this?

1134
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:34,924
Well,
and in return syphilis was delivered to 

1135
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,230
Europe.
At least that's the theory,

1136
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,470
although it's not,
you know,

1137
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:41,883
there isn't any certainty about that.
But it seemed to appear at about the 

1138
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:46,390
same time.
So the Europeans brought endless numbers

1139
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:47,224
of horrible diseases to the new world 
and then the new world returned the 

1140
00:59:50,141 --> 00:59:52,750
favor with one horrible disease.
But there's a point here,

1141
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,790
while I'm still in,
this still happens.

1142
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,710
So if you go into the Amazon,
you find your tribe that you know,

1143
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,573
hasn't been discovered yet or anywhere 
else in the world and you go up and you 

1144
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:02,050
shake their hand,
it's like,

1145
01:00:02,051 --> 01:00:04,210
that's great,
but they're all dancing like a month.

1146
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,690
So,
so why is this important?

1147
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,973
Well,
we don't know how often this sort of 

1148
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:11,254
thing has happened in the past.
And so it could easily be the case that 

1149
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,333
part of the reason that people are leery
of people who aren't like them is 

1150
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:21,790
because over our evolutionary of the 
course of our evolutionary history,

1151
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,420
it was at least moderately probable that
you read.

1152
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,283
If you ran into another group of people,
even if they didn't kill you and you 

1153
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,334
immediately went to war,
that the mere contact would devastate 

1154
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:34,690
you.
You know?

1155
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:37,990
And you can imagine how that sort of 
thing would be attributed to things like

1156
01:00:37,991 --> 01:00:41,920
magical power of curses or you know,
whatever have you when people are trying

1157
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:44,320
to strive for an explanation for the 
phenomenon.

1158
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,580
So that's a nasty little idea.

1159
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,210
Now check this out.

1160
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,380
Okay.

1161
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,430
So this study,

1162
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,950
according to a parasite stress 
hypothesis,

1163
01:01:05,951 --> 01:01:06,784
authoritarian governments are more 
likely to emerge in regions 

1164
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:12,190
characterized by a high prevalence of 
disease causing pathogens.

1165
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,820
Recent cross national evidence is 
consistent with this hypothesis,

1166
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:19,180
but there are inferential limitations 
associated with that evidence.

1167
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,960
We report to studies that address some 
of these limitations and provide further

1168
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:23,794
tests of the hypothesis.
Study one revealed that parasite 

1169
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:28,623
prevalence strongly predicted cross 
national differences on measures 

1170
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:32,164
assessing individual's authoritarian 
personalities and that this affects the 

1171
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:39,280
tedious statistically mediated the 
relationship between parasite prevalence

1172
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:41,110
and authoritarian governance.
Okay,

1173
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:44,320
so let's unpack that.
What does it mean more disease?

1174
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:49,620
The more the people are authoritarian,
the more the people are authoritarian at

1175
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:50,584
the local level,
at the level of their individual 

1176
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:52,774
beliefs,
the more likely the government is to be 

1177
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:56,590
authoritarian.
So it's disease,

1178
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,030
individual government,
right?

1179
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,193
So that's really something
study to tested the parasite stress 

1180
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:06,970
hypothesis.

1181
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,640
In a sample of traditional small scale 
societies,

1182
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:10,743
revolt results revealed that parasite 
prevalence predicted measures of 

1183
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:14,854
authoritarian governance and did so 
evenly when even when statistically 

1184
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:21,090
controlling for threats to human 
welfare,

1185
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,140
what additional threat famine also 
uniquely predicted.

1186
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,910
Authoritarianism.
Yeah.

1187
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,390
But I should also point out that the 
historical reasons for famine,

1188
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,224
we're often tightly associated with the 
historical reasons for disease 

1189
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:34,920
prevalence.
So you know,

1190
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:35,754
if you were invaded by rats,
they are going to eat everything that 

1191
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:38,784
you produced and the probability that 
they're going to bring disease along 

1192
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:44,310
with them was pretty damn high.
But look at the correlations together.

1193
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:45,144
These results further substantiate the 
parasite stress hypothesis of 

1194
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:48,504
authoritarianism and suggested societal 
differences in authoritarian governance 

1195
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:52,644
result in part from cultural differences
and individual's authoritarian 

1196
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:57,930
personalities.
Okay.

1197
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,913
What's the correlation between 
authoritarian governance and pathogen 

1198
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:02,274
prevalence?
Point four to remember what we said 

1199
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:06,630
about effect sizes.

1200
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,010
That's as powerful an effect as the 
relationship between Iq and grades.

1201
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,530
It's a whopping effect.
And you know,

1202
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:16,290
there's a lot of error in these 
measurements so you can be sure that the

1203
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,124
true correlation is higher
famine was also associated with 

1204
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,970
authoritarian governance.
Um,

1205
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,250
so wow,
I read that paper and I thought really,

1206
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,860
could that really be the case?
Is that what happens is that,

1207
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,000
especially as the incidents of 
transmissible diseases increase,

1208
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,670
people clamp down on their moral 
structures.

1209
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:39,504
They don't let you know.
They don't allow contact between each 

1210
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,093
between.
They tightened the borders at every 

1211
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,340
level,
at every level.

1212
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,080
Sexual,
personal,

1213
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,260
familial,
at the level of the village,

1214
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,170
at the level of the state,
they closed the borders.

1215
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,033
You know when you can think of the 
ultimate border as the surface of your 

1216
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:00,420
skin,
you know it is very few people.

1217
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,463
There are very few people who believe 
that border should be so open that they 

1218
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:08,940
don't want control over the border of 
their own skin.

1219
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,770
And then you might say,
well,

1220
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,500
how far out should that be extended in?
The answer to that is,

1221
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:14,580
well,
that's debatable,

1222
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:15,983
but there's obviously a limit on
universality of access and there's 

1223
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:24,150
reason for that.
I mean,

1224
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,700
there's multiple reasons for it,
but this appears to be one of them.

1225
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,010
So you know,
one of the things that indicates,

1226
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,800
and this is mind boggling,
who would have guessed this,

1227
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,903
is that perhaps the best way to fight 
authoritarianism across the world is to 

1228
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:37,074
institute effective public health 
programs and get rid of the infectious 

1229
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:41,550
diseases.
Now who would have guessed that?

1230
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,780
But you know,
it,

1231
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,613
it makes sense to some degree if,
if the general level of danger and 

1232
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:48,984
threat is actually lowered,
maybe people don't have to be so 

1233
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:56,220
defensive and you know,
and a judgmental and,

1234
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:59,610
and xenophobic.
You know,

1235
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,433
we think often that it's political 
argumentation that does this sort of 

1236
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:03,960
thing.

1237
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,420
But
you know,

1238
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:09,390
there's no malaria in North America.
There's no malaria in Europe.

1239
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,010
There was like,
you know,

1240
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,630
200 years ago,
Washington,

1241
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:15,090
Boston,
those places were malarial pits,

1242
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,750
you know,
but it was public health that got rid of

1243
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:18,584
almost all of that.
So maybe we're all liberal and friendly 

1244
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:23,780
because we don't have any infectious 
diseases would not be something.

1245
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,320
But you know,
our 0.42 correlation,

1246
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:30,170
this was a big study too.
That's a big correlation.

1247
01:05:30,171 --> 01:05:32,990
I've never seen a correlation like that.
Especially Laura.

1248
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,380
Think about the probability that those 
things would be related.

1249
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,303
Right.
Is the self report measure of political 

1250
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:41,270
belief.
And the other is a public health measure

1251
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,104
of disease prevalence and the 
probability that those things would be 

1252
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:46,880
associated just fight.
You know,

1253
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:50,990
you would just never guess that unless 
you came to it the hard way through this

1254
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:54,650
entire logic that we just discussed.
Okay.

1255
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,063
So,

1256
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,890
so while I was going through this 
literature,

1257
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,590
I was also reading Hitler's table talk 
and Hitler's table talk was a collection

1258
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:09,424
of his spontaneous speeches delivered 
over the dinner table from 1939 to 1942 

1259
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:18,070
which was roughly the period where the 
Nazis were winning the war.

1260
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,300
And I noticed something that I haven't 
noticed before and what I noticed before

1261
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:26,800
was that Hitler had a very powerful 
behavioral immune system.

1262
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,440
And so what did that mean?
So you know,

1263
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:32,050
you often hear that the Nazis 
annihilated that.

1264
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:35,470
The people that they annihilated because
they were afraid of them,

1265
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,140
let's say.
But you then you think about Nazis,

1266
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:39,340
you know,
and you think,

1267
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,500
yeah,
maybe fear wasn't there.

1268
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,990
Overwhelming characteristic.
You know,

1269
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,810
it's some more like brutality or 
something like that,

1270
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:50,320
but it's not fear then you don't picture
them trembling in their boots,

1271
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:51,154
you know,
down in the basement or something like 

1272
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:52,330
that.

1273
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,430
It's not that.
So,

1274
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,990
okay.
So anyways,

1275
01:06:55,991 --> 01:07:00,991
so I was reading his book and Hitler was
very high in openness by the way,

1276
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,410
and very high in orderliness by all 
appearances.

1277
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:08,980
And so he,
his vision for the area in race,

1278
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,810
so he had this race,
racial theory,

1279
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:11,644
right in the racial theory was that the 
proper inhabitants of Europe and 

1280
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,470
hypothetically the world were blonde,
blue eyed ariens,

1281
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,080
which,
which is really not a category and that,

1282
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,873
and that it,
the world would be a better place if 

1283
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,820
they were the dominant group and that 
all the other groups were gone.

1284
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,193
Also then you think,
well how did Hitler conceptualize this 

1285
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:35,644
area in race?
And the answer is he conceptualized it 

1286
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:38,644
as a body.
It was the body of it was the body of 

1287
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:42,844
the area in race.
And then he conceptualized all the 

1288
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:49,180
people that he was out to annihilate as 
parasitical invaders.

1289
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,810
And so Hitler's metaphor for the Nazi 
genocide wasn't fear.

1290
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,480
It was discussed.

1291
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,383
Okay.

1292
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,460
And that's a whole different idea.
Now let me tell you some things about,

1293
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,580
oh,
in,

1294
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,100
with regards to the orderly part.
Well,

1295
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,480
you can just check out the,

1296
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,663
okay.

1297
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,543
You know,
you're just not going to see a more 

1298
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:21,554
orderly gathering.
The people then the picture on the 

1299
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:24,110
right,
you know,

1300
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:27,810
at Nuremberg,
which was the prime place where the Nazi

1301
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:28,644
staged their celebrations was the 
biggest gathering field ever made in 

1302
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,304
human history.
People arrange themselves hundreds of 

1303
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,070
thousands of people into perfect 
squares,

1304
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,400
everything.
And you remember that Jack boot,

1305
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,583
a goose step march and the Hail Hitler.
It's like it's all done an absolutely 

1306
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:52,130
perfect sequence and Hitler was a great 
admirer of willpower.

1307
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,113
He was very happy that he could stand in
the back of his car for eight hours and 

1308
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:59,150
keep his hand out like this and he 
bathed four times a day.

1309
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,483
So what you saw,
what seems to have driven what happened 

1310
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,223
in Nazi Germany and perhaps is one of 
the things that drive right wing 

1311
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:15,020
political movements to this day is 
heightened sensitivity to discussed.

1312
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,063
Now here's how it all got going.
And this is a very brief overview and 

1313
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:24,730
many other things happened when Hitler 
came to power.

1314
01:09:24,731 --> 01:09:25,564
And that was about 1933 thereabouts.
He put into place a variety of public 

1315
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:32,950
health initiatives.
And one of them for example,

1316
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:36,460
was he built these vans that had x ray 
machines.

1317
01:09:36,461 --> 01:09:37,294
And then when he went around everywhere 
and screen people for tuberculosis 

1318
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,500
seemed like a good thing.
Okay.

1319
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:46,210
And then one of the things he did after 
that was go on a factory beautification,

1320
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,640
a binge,
so to speak.

1321
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:49,474
And so partly that was driven by 
openness because he wanted things to be 

1322
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:52,864
aesthetically pleasing,
but a lot of it was driven by 

1323
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:55,114
orderliness.
And so you're supposed to go into your 

1324
01:09:56,411 --> 01:09:57,244
factory and sweep the damn thing out and
fix the yard in front of it and plant 

1325
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:03,490
some flowers and you know,
make it a look all nice and suburban and

1326
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,480
under control.

1327
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,160
All right.
So that was,

1328
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:08,200
you know,
maybe still not such a bad idea.

1329
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,920
But you know,
when you go into your factory,

1330
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:12,754
while there's rats there and there's 
like bugs and things that shouldn't be 

1331
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:16,000
there.
And so maybe you think,

1332
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,740
well let's get rid of the rats and the 
bugs.

1333
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:22,741
And so then you use an insecticide spray
and not spray happened to be Zyklon B,

1334
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,230
which we'll return to momentarily while.
So after that,

1335
01:10:26,231 --> 01:10:29,800
then Hitler went on a euthanasia kick 
and it was sort of like,

1336
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:33,490
you know,
we can get rid of the people who are not

1337
01:10:33,491 --> 01:10:35,410
contributing and you know,
who are

1338
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,280
not fit to live,
shall we say.

1339
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:43,450
And so that started with euthanasia.
And so it started with people who are in

1340
01:10:43,451 --> 01:10:44,284
mental hospitals for example,
and people who had biological 

1341
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:47,914
intellectual deficits in such.
And from there it went to people have 

1342
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:55,730
the wrong religious tradition.
And from there,

1343
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:58,960
and that was first of all only being 
rounded up and herded into council,

1344
01:10:58,961 --> 01:10:59,794
let's say,
or first deprived of your property and 

1345
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,100
of your identity and then rounded up and
put and put into camps.

1346
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:05,143
But what it ended up with was genocidal 
and isolation in gas chambers with 

1347
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:12,830
Zyklon B.
Right.

1348
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,100
And so,
you know,

1349
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:19,101
the Nazis would describe the people that
they were tormenting as parasites and as

1350
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,670
insects and as rats.
And that's not fear language,

1351
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:31,890
that's discussed language.
And so it's an appalling

1352
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:35,933
paradox because the behavioral immune 
system along with the immune system is 

1353
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:40,794
clearly designed to stop people from 
dying right in your immune system 

1354
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:49,710
distinguishes between you and not you 
and you do the same thing at many levels

1355
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,480
of behavior,
especially sexually.

1356
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,690
And you know who's going to say that 
there's anything wrong with that.

1357
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:55,524
It's the same thing when you try to keep
your bathroom cleaned in your kitchen 

1358
01:11:57,481 --> 01:12:00,240
clean and the city streets cleaned in 
all of that and you think,

1359
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,860
well that's all for the good.
It's like,

1360
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,110
yeah,
but look what happens when that gets out

1361
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,910
of control.
You know?

1362
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:08,550
And that's a terrible thing in a sense 
because it's,

1363
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:09,643
it's one thing if something that's bad 
in and of itself gets out of hand and 

1364
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:14,634
then make something really bad,
but it's really a whole different 

1365
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:20,340
category of awful.
When something appears to be pretty much

1366
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,293
are only for benefit and it gets out of 
control and it gets so horrible that it 

1367
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:28,050
produces a worse effects,
then the effects that it was designed to

1368
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:28,884
prevent.

1369
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:39,350
I want to just show you a little bit of 
a film that goes along with this.

1370
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,733
Oh,
there is an example of Nazi order as 

1371
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,584
well.
So that's at Nuremberg and I need to 

1372
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:48,210
explain this picture to you.
So the Nuremberg field was massive.

1373
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:49,320
As I said,
you see those,

1374
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,303
those curtains,
those are lights and the lights are the 

1375
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:57,510
search lights from the lift Wafa which 
was the Nazi air force.

1376
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:01,440
And Hitler would put those up behind him
when he was speaking.

1377
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:02,274
And so then he'd be have a curtain of 
lights behind him that stretched up so 

1378
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:08,280
high into the sky that you couldn't see 
the top of them.

1379
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,580
And everybody was organized out there in
they're in their,

1380
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:13,350
ah,
on the marching field.

1381
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:16,650
See there is a good example there.
Look at those people on the left top,

1382
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:21,510
left there.
They're organized in multiple dimensions

1383
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:22,344
simultaneously.
And then on the right you see a 

1384
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:25,044
Nuremberg parade ground and there's 
hundreds of thousands of people there 

1385
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:31,140
and they're all in absolutely perfect 
corridors.

1386
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,860
These are comments from the,
from Hitler and from the Nazis.

1387
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:41,823
People,
the world will recognize the Jew as 

1388
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,744
world parasite.
And there will be kind of a time when 

1389
01:13:45,341 --> 01:13:48,400
there will be one united front of all 
people against the Jewish world.

1390
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:49,234
Parasite and humanity will be freed from
the most severe illness from which he 

1391
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:55,210
suffered for thousands of years.
So,

1392
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:56,044
and here's,
here's some quotes from Hitler from a 

1393
01:13:58,871 --> 01:14:01,480
paper called Hitler's ideology embodied 
metaphor,

1394
01:14:01,481 --> 01:14:02,590
fantasy.
In history,

1395
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:08,110
the state did not power possess the 
power to manifest the disease.

1396
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,990
The menacing decay of the right was 
manifest.

1397
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,270
Politicians tinkering around on the 
German national body.

1398
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,760
So most of the forms of our general 
disease,

1399
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:22,630
but blindly ignored the virus.
At the time of the unification,

1400
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:23,464
the inner decay was already in full 
swing and the general situation was 

1401
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,364
deteriorating from year to year.
The station did not grow inwardly 

1402
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:33,400
healthier,
but obviously languished more and more.

1403
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:37,900
The symptoms of decay of the prewar 
period can be reduced to racial causes.

1404
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,580
Anyone who wants to cure this era,
which was inwardly sick and rotten,

1405
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,623
must first of all,
sum up the courage to make clear the 

1406
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:46,024
causes of this disease.
They think that they must demonstrate 

1407
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,193
that they are ready for appeasement,
so as to stay that deadly cancerous 

1408
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:57,220
ulcer through a policy of moderation.
If this battle should not come,

1409
01:14:57,221 --> 01:15:01,030
Germany would decay and at best would 
sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.

1410
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:03,760
Well,
you get the idea.

1411
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,613
And you know,
it's so interesting to me because you 

1412
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:09,550
know,
this is straight psychological research.

1413
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,080
Most of it's psychometric,
you know,

1414
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:11,914
and all of a sudden out of that comes 
this finding that orderliness is linked 

1415
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:17,260
to conservatism and it's linked to the 
behavioral immune system.

1416
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,213
And poof,
you have a completely new explanation 

1417
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:22,900
for what happened with the Nazis.
So,

1418
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,060
so that's what happens when orderliness 
gets out of hand.

1419
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,223
And it's interesting too,
because the Germans are known for their 

1420
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:33,130
orderliness,
for their engineering prowess,

1421
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,460
you know,
for the organization and cleanliness and

1422
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,580
freedom from corruption of their 
political state.

1423
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:43,540
And yet this is what happens when it's 
taken to an extreme.
