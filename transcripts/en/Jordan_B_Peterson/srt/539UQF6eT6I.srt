1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,540
So last time
we talked a little bit about

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,700
the state of the world of belief I 
suppose by the end of the 19th century.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,873
And I talked to you a little bit about 
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and 

4
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,810
Kierkegaard,
um,

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,383
a
very large number of the clinical 

6
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:27,804
theories that we're going to be 
discussing for another two lectures 

7
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,070
after this one have been influenced by 
philosophers.

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,460
And that's partly why I'm also talking 
to you about the philosophers.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,103
Um,
it's almost as if in some sense the 

10
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,854
great philosophers have our tap directly
into the lower strata of the park are 

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,263
our cultural systems of meaning as they 
move forward in time and they can 

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,300
outline what those structures are and 
also describe their weaknesses and their

13
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,270
strengths and their likely 
transformations moving forward.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,873
You know,
I mean obviously people can be behind 

15
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,034
the times and just as it's just as 
probable that some people are ahead of 

16
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,364
the times.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,280
And we would assume,
if you're thinking about it,

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,143
say from a big five trait perspective,
that the people who are ahead of the 

19
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:28,290
times often are very,
very intelligent and very,

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,124
very open.
And of course that's a pretty good 

21
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:33,520
definition of a philosopher.
So

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,453
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky,
I think more than any other two 

23
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:44,301
thinkers,
had their finger on the pulse of the

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,823
transmutation of cultural systems of 
meaning in the at the end of the 19th 

25
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,224
century.
And they were both very concerned about 

26
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
the fact that
the systems of meaning within which 

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,620
Western civilization at least had taken 
shape,

28
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,610
had been fragmented for a variety of 
reasons.

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
The most important of which was likely 
the rise of the scientific world view.

30
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,310
And as I detailed to you in the last 
lecture,

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,560
both Dostoyevsky and Nichi believed that
that had left modern people.

32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,760
Because I think in the early 20th 
century it was Western people.

33
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,594
But now I think it's reasonable to say 
that it's modern people in a state of 

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,730
their,
their,

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,960
their cultural discontinuity,
that things,

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,183
belief systems,
but also technological systems now have 

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,263
transformed the world so radically that 
the conflict between modernism and 

38
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:57,270
traditional forms of belief is acutely 
felt everywhere.

39
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
It's certainly,
I think one of the forces that have 

40
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,174
given rise to the battle between Islamic
fundamentalism and modernism because 

41
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,064
it's more of that than a battle of 
Islamic fundamentalism against the 

42
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,590
Western world.
And the problem fundamentally is,

43
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:23,500
is that people typically exist within 
cultural constructs that are very,

44
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,200
very ancient and that have,
that are grounded in,

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
in evolved systems of meaning that that 
are even deeper than the ones that are 

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
articulated and explicit.
And when there's a period of very,

47
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
very rapid cognitive and technological 
change than the integrity of those 

48
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:49,381
systems starts to,
it starts to become questionable from an

49
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,863
explicit perspective,
but it also starts to become 

50
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,670
insufficient from a practical 
perspective.

51
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,504
So one example that you might give some 
consideration to is the fact of the 

52
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,700
introduction of the birth control pill.
For example,

53
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,683
no one,
if you listen to politically minded 

54
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:13,000
people,
they make the case that the

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,480
emancipation of women was essentially a 
political matter.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,380
But I don't think that that's a very 
reasonable way of looking at it at all.

57
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,280
Of course,
the things,

58
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,293
everything feeds back onto itself and 
there are multiple causal pathways to 

59
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,354
any end.
The radical element in the emancipation 

60
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,390
of women was of course the development 
of efficient forms of contraception,

61
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,120
most particularly the birth control 
pill.

62
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,130
And it's the case that as soon as you 
educate women anywhere in the world,

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,060
not only does economic productivity rise
dramatically,

64
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:52,894
in fact,
it's actually the best predictor of 

65
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,814
increase in economic predict 
productivity in a modernizing state is 

66
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,980
the granting of rights to women.
Now,

67
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,814
whether it's directly because of the 
granting of rights to women or because 

68
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,394
of the existence of an underlying belief
structure that allows the concept of 

69
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:14,470
right to expand quite rapidly,
it's very difficult to be sure of.

70
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,304
But in any case that exists.
And then of course the other thing that 

71
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:23,371
happens is that women stop having 
children unbelievably rapidly.

72
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,990
So for example,
I think,

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I believe it's Iran
where this has been most market over the

74
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:32,524
last two generations.
So from family sizes far greater than 

75
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,560
replacement,
two family sizes,

76
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,170
well below replacement in basically one 
or two generations.

77
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,004
It's a massive transformation and it's 
not necessarily something that anyone 

78
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:48,700
expected.
It's part of the sequence of forces that

79
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,701
are
rapidly allowing our population to reach

80
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,320
a peak and then either stabilize or 
decline.

81
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:00,110
I don't know how many of you know this,
but the projections are that there'll be

82
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:04,250
9 billion people on the earth within 30 
to 50 years.

83
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,590
And that'll be our peak population after
that,

84
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,840
it will fall rapidly.
And you know,

85
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,340
you can see that sort of thing happening
right now all over the western world.

86
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:16,550
And it's happening a lot in China and 
it's happening in Japan where you know,

87
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,384
there are more older people than there 
are younger people because the younger 

88
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,450
people aren't having enough children to 
actually replace the population.

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,350
So the probability that we'll peak at 
about 9 billion and then start to fall,

90
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,723
it's not certain,
but that's what the best projections 

91
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,060
seemed to indicate now.
Oh,

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,913
so what happens anyways with in periods 
of very rapid technological and and 

93
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,360
cognitive transformation,
because those things go together,

94
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,493
that the,
the certainties upon which people base 

95
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:45,524
their interpretation of the world and 
even more importantly base their 

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,270
judgments about how to act start to 
become uncertain.

97
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,170
So,
for example,

98
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:01,820
if you introduced the birth control pill
into a population and you put,

99
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,193
um,
women's reproductive faculties under 

100
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,284
their own voluntary choice,
then you radically transform virtually 

101
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,890
all of societies.
Fundamental social structures,

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,830
not least marriage and marriage of 
course,

103
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,570
is being regarded classically as the 
foundation of civilization.

104
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,463
And of course,
increasingly there are more people who 

105
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:29,270
aren't married then there are people who
are married now.

106
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,513
It's very difficult to know what to make
of that because of course there's no 

107
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,054
setting the clock back and
it's not even clear that you would want 

108
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,230
to set back the clock if you could.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,513
But expecting cultural constructs,
which take centuries or maybe even 

110
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,930
thousands or maybe even tens of 
thousands of years to develop,

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,200
to keep up with change of that magnitude
is it's not possible.

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,633
You know what I mean?
And you guys face technological 

113
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:04,970
transformations that are earth 
shattering on an almost yearly basis and

114
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,560
you hardly even notice it.
I mean,

115
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,900
tinder is a good example of that.
You know,

116
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,480
I don't know if you know,
but tinder has produced quite a spike in

117
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,120
sexually transmitted diseases.
But you know,

118
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,983
it's a radical technology because it's 
the first technology that's ever been 

119
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:22,751
invented that enables men to find 
partners with no fear,

120
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,403
with virtually no fear of rejection.
And of course that's been a limiting 

121
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,304
factor for,
that's been a defining feature of the 

122
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,830
interactions between men and women ever 
since history began.

123
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,580
And so these things are occurring at an 
extraordinary rate and of course it's,

124
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,363
it's not reasonable to expect are more 
slower moving cultural constructs to 

125
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:48,170
keep up with them.

126
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,660
And that's partly because as well that,
you know,

127
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,110
people talk for example,
about the divisive nature of religion.

128
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:56,640
You,
you often hear people who are critics of

129
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,700
formal religion in particular talk about
the fact that religion,

130
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,320
underwire underlies a tremendous amount 
of destruction and warfare and conflict.

131
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,000
And you know,
first of all,

132
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,190
it isn't religion that does that.
By the way,

133
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,024
it's tribalism.
Tribalism characterizes even 

134
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,264
chimpanzees.
And I don't think chimpanzees go to war 

135
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,130
with each other for religious reasons.
So,

136
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,263
you know,
the religious groupings of mankind are 

137
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,130
our large scale manifestations of the 
same phenomena that produce dominance,

138
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,004
hierarchies in the wild.
And of course large scale religions 

139
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,844
unite people within the religion just as
much as they divide people on the 

140
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,750
outside of it.
So part of the accumulation of religious

141
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,584
tradition across time is a process that 
allows thousands and 10 thousands and 

142
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,594
even millions of people to exist within 
the same hierarchy of values and exist 

143
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,570
relatively peacefully.

144
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,660
As a consequence.
Now I'm saying relatively peacefully,

145
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,243
you know,
a hundred years ago it was thought that 

146
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,443
pre let's say let's say archaic people.
So those would be people who are still 

147
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:05,310
living a fairly isolated tribal life in 
small groups pre,

148
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,383
you know,
basically operating at the level of 

149
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,150
stone age technology.
Let's say.

150
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,830
The idea was there was a very popular 
idea for a long time that those cultures

151
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:17,940
were um,
communistic and violence free.

152
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,940
And that's wrong.
They're not violence for you at all.

153
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,240
If you track the homicide rates in stone
age,

154
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:24,074
culture is they're way,
way higher than they are in civilized 

155
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,830
cultures,
like orders of magnitude higher.

156
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,350
And there's a variety of reasons for 
that.

157
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,184
But I'm just telling you that because 
you want to dispense with the idea that 

158
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,893
along with complex civilizations and 
this fred say of unifying religious 

159
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,210
beliefs,
there was an increase,

160
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,153
an increase in baseline violence because
there's just no evidence for that at 

161
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:46,584
all.

162
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,690
Now the problem with these large scale 
belief systems is they're not very fast.

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,850
And part of the reason for that is that 
in order for a large scale belief system

164
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,080
to,
to,

165
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,303
to,
uh,

166
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,303
manifest itself in any reasonable form,
it has to be predicated on the mutual 

167
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:09,921
agreement of the people within whom,
within,

168
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,430
who operate within its embrace.
You know?

169
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,264
So for,
for Toronto to exist as a city has a 

170
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,630
peaceful city,
basically what has to happen is that the

171
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:22,464
vast majority of us have to agree that 
the rules that govern the city and the 

172
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:30,360
social interactions within the city are 
useful.

173
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,194
And just,
and because if you don't agree with 

174
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:34,974
that,
then splinter movements of all sorts 

175
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,250
start to occur and people become more 
revolutionary in their modes of action.

176
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:44,250
And then they become more violent than 
the whole system starts to break down.

177
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,083
So it's not easy to establish a 
collective norm because people have to 

178
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:51,714
agree to it.
And you can imagine that hammering out 

179
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,940
agreement with anything,
with even a small agreement that affects

180
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:58,774
many,
many people is a process that takes a 

181
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,264
tremendous amount of time.
And people can argue forever about the 

182
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:07,750
smallest alterations in the systems that
regulate our behavior.

183
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,453
Now,
you know,

184
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,240
some of you might be familiar with the 
terror management theories.

185
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,490
How many of you have heard of terror 
management theory?

186
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,133
Okay,
well,

187
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,273
the terror management theories are 
predicated on the idea that our belief 

188
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,470
systems protect us from our fear of 
death.

189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,933
Now exactly how they do that isn't 
specified particularly well in the 

190
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,550
terror management theories.
But the originator of the theory,

191
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:31,384
whose name was Ernest Becker,
who was a sociologist by the way on a 

192
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:35,434
Friday.
And,

193
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,620
um,
believe that cultural systems enabled us

194
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:46,270
to attribute beliefs to our actions,
finite and infinite,

195
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:49,870
so that we could consider ourselves in 
relationship to mortality.

196
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,940
And in some sense,
hide from the truth of the,

197
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,760
a tune of our existence.
Now,

198
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,740
one of the things the terror management 
theorists don't really give any credence

199
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,210
to is the fact that belief systems are 
not only systems of belief,

200
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:07,540
there's systems of action regulation,
right?

201
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,290
So we've talked about the Piagetian 
notion of a game.

202
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,903
The game exists first as something that 
everyone can play and only later as 

203
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:17,944
something that people represent.
And as social cultures the same way a 

204
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:22,544
cultural,
a culture regulates the way that you 

205
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,580
interact with each other and what you 
expect from each other,

206
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,630
and how you can fulfill your mutual,
your needs in,

207
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,630
in relationship to one another.
And then it's represented.

208
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:38,440
And the representation might help you 
find meaning in your life.

209
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,290
But the fact of the initial social 
contract,

210
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,710
which is the phenomena that regulates 
your interpersonal behavior,

211
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,460
doesn't protect you from the fear of 
death.

212
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,040
It protects you from dying.
And,

213
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,030
and that's a very important thing to 
note.

214
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,601
I mean,
you know,

215
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:55,180
all of you know,
of course it's very cold out today.

216
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,014
And yet here you are in this classroom 
where it's renal ridiculously 

217
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:00,880
comfortable,
you know,

218
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,350
by classroom standards and of course by 
standards around the world.

219
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,600
And you're not freezing to death in 
here.

220
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:11,020
And that's not your belief that's 
protecting you.

221
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,393
It's the fact that you're embedded in 
this insanely complicated system of 

222
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,594
cultural interactions.
And it just so happens that you get to 

223
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,040
sit here and listen to a lecture.
Well,

224
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:25,000
there's thousands of people beating 
around many of them outside in the cold,

225
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,400
making sure that the power grid,
for example,

226
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:30,550
that keeps this place warm,
is properly maintained and functional,

227
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,384
which takes a tremendous amount of work.
So when in during periods of rapid 

228
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:36,934
transformation,
it's hard for the social contract to 

229
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,144
adjust itself so that everyone knows how
to behave in relationship to one 

230
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,300
another.

231
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,450
But then it's also very difficult for 
the description of that.

232
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,930
So the articulated norms that constitute
a society,

233
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,003
it's very difficult them to transform 
rapidly enough so that they can keep 

234
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,394
track of the,
of the changes and help people decide 

235
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:03,260
what they should do.
So let me give you an example.

236
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,094
So I had a client a while back who had 
been raised as the fundamentalist 

237
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,290
Christian and she was very,
um,

238
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,230
she had been socialized and had come to 
believe that

239
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,563
sex before marriage was wrong,
but the probability that she was going 

240
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:25,511
to get married before she was 27 or 28 
was low for a whole variety of reasons.

241
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:29,690
And so then she faced this conundrum and
it was an interesting conundrum,

242
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,750
my perspective because you know,
I think that in a well-regulated psyche,

243
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,523
sexuality is integrated into the 
personality so that it's so that it 

244
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:41,684
plays its role in the,
what would you call in Nepal or the of 

245
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:45,810
the south.

246
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,330
It's integrated properly inside.
And so it's under moral control,

247
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,223
roughly speaking because it serves its 
own function plus the function of 

248
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,683
keeping the person well situated in the 
present and developing property in the 

249
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:04,190
future and maintaining proper 
relationships with everyone around them.

250
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,593
But it was quite obvious to me that a 
lot of the constraints that had been 

251
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:12,380
placed on her behavior as a consequence 
of her relatively rigid belief,

252
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,080
we're actually interfering with her 
development as a person.

253
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,543
You know?
And so one of the things we had to 

254
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,440
puzzle out was,
well,

255
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,903
exactly what are the moral guidelines 
that you should use to regulate your 

256
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,304
sexual behavior outside of marriage if 
you're not planning to be married for 

257
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,370
maybe until your late twenties well,
you know,

258
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,340
good luck trying to figure that out.
Like it's a really,

259
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,690
it's a really,
really,

260
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,610
really,
really complicated question.

261
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,563
And it's certainly not obvious that any 
one person can figure out the answer to 

262
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,450
that in a single lifetime.

263
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,150
You know,
even if they thought if nothing else,

264
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,343
especially because of the landscape 
itself is transforming as you're 

265
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,150
attempting to adjust to it.
You know,

266
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:53,984
and we eventually concluded,
although it was a very individual 

267
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,274
solution,
we eventually concluded that there were 

268
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,270
things that she had forbidden herself to
do,

269
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,104
that we're stopping her from 
establishing any kind of longterm 

270
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,700
relationship at all.
And that that was interfering with their

271
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:09,534
development,
you know,

272
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,453
as a mature person.
And that the morality that she had used 

273
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:16,520
to structure her behavior appeared to be
counterproductive,

274
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,570
at least,
you know,

275
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,700
in some,
in some areas.

276
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,610
So it's one thing to,
you know,

277
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,444
to,
to regulate sexuality in the hopes of 

278
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,440
marriage.
When you get married,

279
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,220
when you're,
you know,

280
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,053
19 or 20 or 21 it's a completely 
different thing when it's perhaps not 

281
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:32,684
going to happen until you're in your 
late twenties so now need shit talked a 

282
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,704
lot and Dostoyevsky talked a lot about 
the collapse of meaning systems in the 

283
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,470
late 19th century and you know,
that was followed by a river,

284
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:49,100
very,
very rapid period.

285
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,950
Technological transformation like that 
really kicked in in the late 18 hundreds

286
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,850
which was the,
you know,

287
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,080
the,
well,

288
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,960
was it the height of the industrial 
revolution,

289
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:02,070
particularly in England.
And there were modern technologies being

290
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,040
thrust out of the industrial revolution,
like mad,

291
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,450
like the automobile or near playing in 
the electric light and recording devices

292
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,110
and all of the things that we're still 
elaborating on now.

293
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,730
And then of course,

294
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,040
apart from the collapse of classic say 
Christian belief and the introduction of

295
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,170
all these new technologies when world 
war one hit,

296
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,010
the entire monarchical structure of the 
Western world collapsed.

297
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,070
And that also occurred say with regards 
to the Ottoman Empire.

298
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,970
And that was partly what led to the 
creation of the modern Middle East.

299
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:39,630
And of course we're still,
that still hasn't been sorted out to any

300
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,050
great degree at all.
So the monarchical structures collapsed.

301
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,363
These ancient civilizations,
the Russians underwent their revolution 

302
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,191
and we're,
you know,

303
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:53,790
and were transformed into communists and
then after World War One,

304
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,153
the,
the stress between the potential 

305
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,614
different ways of structuring societies 
after the monarchical societies had 

306
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:07,020
collapsed was almost unbearable and 
people didn't really know what to do.

307
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,123
No.

308
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:08,970
Yeah.

309
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,803
What happened at the end of niches 
period and m Dostoyevsky's period was 

310
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,980
that the question that both of those 
people,

311
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,950
what no

312
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,033
most important question,
both of those people ask became the 

313
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,174
central focus of the development of 
philosophical ideas of ethics in the 

314
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:29,914
20th century.
So you could think about those as that 

315
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,000
has a kind of a post religious ethic.
Now,

316
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:34,834
the reason I'm telling you this is 
because among other things is because a 

317
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:43,801
lot of what cycle analytic or 
psychotherapeutic treatment is about,

318
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:45,694
it's about ethics.
And that can't be stressed too much 

319
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:51,730
because ethics is about how you see the 
world and how you behave.

320
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,103
And so even behaviorists who are 
technically embedded in the scientific 

321
00:19:56,771 --> 00:20:00,740
world are still pregnant,
practical ethicist.

322
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,593
Because what they're consistently doing 
with their clients is breaking down 

323
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,290
whatever the problems are that are 
causing the misery,

324
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,603
breaking them down into sub problems and
trying to figure out solutions that 

325
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,620
improve their quality of life,
like practical,

326
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,740
implementable solutions that improve 
their quality of life,

327
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:20,770
not only now,
but as they propagate into the future.

328
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:24,490
And that is not a scientific issue.
It's a how to live issue.

329
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,390
So the entire history of the 20th 
century,

330
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,650
in some sense,
political,

331
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,484
economic and psychological was a 
sequence of attempts to answer the 

332
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:40,630
question when your fundamental systems 
of ethics collapse,

333
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,580
how is it that you should live

334
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,690
okay

335
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,580
now Nisha said very clearly that 
there'll be two to the collapse of these

336
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,360
systems and one would be nihilism,
the belief and nothing at all,

337
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,590
which he also regarded as a form of 
escape from responsibility.

338
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:01,180
So it's a logical consequence of the 
breakdown of classical belief systems,

339
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,014
but it's also a a cop out and it's the 
kind of cop out that dusty Husky 

340
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:10,660
explored very deeply in his small 
resilient novel notes from underground,

341
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:15,310
which describes a person who's basically
slipped and intellect intelligent person

342
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,293
and an irresponsible person who's 
basically slipped into a pit of 

343
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:23,890
meaninglessness where he experienced his
hatred and resentment and the desire for

344
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:24,724
revenge and all of the sorts of things 
that would afflict someone in the 

345
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:31,420
underworld who's got nothing to hold 
them together.

346
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,883
And then of course,
nature also talked about the likelihood 

347
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:36,724
that people would turn to totalitarian 
belief systems such and he particularly 

348
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:43,960
discussed communism as a replacement for
religious belief.

349
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,810
I can give you a Canadian example of 
that.

350
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:51,811
So I heard a Gallup pollster one time,
I was at a conference in Ottawa.

351
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,810
It's the only time I've ever heard this.
And I think it's an amazing,

352
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,243
it's an amazing fact.
They were looking at the probability 

353
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,950
that people would be separatists in 
Quebec.

354
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,293
And if you are a lapsed Catholic,
the probability that you will be a 

355
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,460
separate as was increased 10 times.
And the reason for that is,

356
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,294
you know,
Catholicism fell apart in Quebec in the 

357
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:20,260
late 1950s it was one of the last places
in the Western world,

358
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:22,540
roughly speaking,
where the,

359
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,793
the feudal in some sense structures of 
Catholicism had maintained themselves 

360
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,284
right up to that point right up to the 
1950s late 1950s and that collapsed 

361
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:34,684
precipitously,
just like belief in Christianity had in 

362
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,440
Russia,
you know,

363
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,250
in the late say 1880s and what happened 
in Quebec was,

364
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:44,170
well first of all,
the birth rate plummeted.

365
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,033
I mean I did genetic research in Quebec 
and in the 1950s and before that it was 

366
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:52,600
very typical to see families of nine to 
13 children.

367
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,810
And of course by now Quebec has the 
lowest birth rate.

368
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,390
I believe in the Western world,
it's way below replacement.

369
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,970
Everybody bailed out of the church,
nobody gets married.

370
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,390
And if you were a separate,
as if you were a lapsed Catholic,

371
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,650
you are 10 times more likely to be a 
separate list.

372
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,970
All that meant was that with Catholicism
fell apart,

373
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,403
you know,
people who still needed to have very 

374
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,230
structured belief systems just turned to
nationalism as a natural alternative.

375
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,850
You know,
and that's part of what,

376
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,560
that's part of what accounted for the,
the rigidity and utopian,

377
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,920
uh,
the utopian,

378
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,660
the Utopian nature of the Quebec 
movement towards independence.

379
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,823
You know,
I remember talking to one of my 

380
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:34,900
callings,
very,

381
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,190
very intelligent person.

382
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,200
And uh,
you know,

383
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,034
I asked him because at that point they 
were predicting that if Quebec 

384
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:43,564
separated,
the Canadian dollar would fall to 40 

385
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,603
cents,
45 cents us something like that and be 

386
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,210
complete economic catastrophe.
I said,

387
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:50,631
well,
you know,

388
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,464
the,
the predictions are that if Canada 

389
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:53,834
separates and first of all or Quebec 
separates and no one would know how to 

390
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,090
do that is the Canadian economy will 
collapse.

391
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,670
And of course that will collapse the 
Quebec economy too.

392
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:02,881
And he,
he,

393
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:04,190
he didn't deny that.
He said,

394
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,540
yeah,
but it would be worth it.

395
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,101
And I thought,
well,

396
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:10,280
there's just no way of having a 
conversation under those circumstances.

397
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,560
Because from my perspective,
total,

398
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,743
you know,
severe economic collapse is a good 

399
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:18,730
reason not to do something.
But if you believe that the pope,

400
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,210
the future potential is such that that's
justified,

401
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,340
then well there's no arguing with you.

402
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,280
It's just something that you've decided.
And that's the end of that.

403
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,980
And when I lived in Quebec,
as I did for a long time,

404
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,814
I learned very quickly never to have a 
discussion about politics with anyone 

405
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,624
who was a separate,
just because it was just absolutely 

406
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
counterproductive.
You know,

407
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:42,620
they had axioms of belief that were 
movable.

408
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:43,454
Like the future will be good enough so 
that no matter what price we pay in the 

409
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,080
present,
that will be justified.

410
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,640
It's like,
well that's not an idea.

411
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:51,380
Right?
It's a statement of faith.

412
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,080
And you saw a doctor the same thing 
happening,

413
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,230
not with the same principles.
I'm not saying that,

414
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,064
but you saw the same thing happening 
from a psychological perspective in 

415
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,810
Russia when the Communists,
you know,

416
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:03,644
when the communists really started to 
become active in the 1920s when any 

417
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:07,484
matter of horror whatsoever was fully 
justifiable because it was going to 

418
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:15,170
bring about some future state that was 
basically equivalent to paradise.

419
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,260
So anyways,
so,

420
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,310
and then you know,
Dostoyevsky pursued the idea of nihilism

421
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,144
even farther because Dostoyevsky was 
certainly someone who was willing to go 

422
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:26,954
to the ends of an argument.
And one of the things he proclaimed was 

423
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:33,170
that if there was no god than anything 
was permitted.

424
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,333
And his basic hypothesis was,
well as if there's no all ultimate 

425
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,353
arbiter of values,
if there's no transcendent arbiter of 

426
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:45,020
values,
then you're radically free.

427
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,270
Now the existentialists would say,
well,

428
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:50,420
you could use that radical freedom to 
find meaning in your life.

429
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,583
But one of the things Dostoyevsky 
realized was that you could use that 

430
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,480
radical freedom for anything that you 
wanted.

431
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,640
And so in his book,
crime and punishment,

432
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:03,110
for example,
he explores the actions and beliefs of a

433
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:07,970
student named Rascal Nacog and risk 
called Nicole is a starving student.

434
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,580
He's a law student and he doesn't have 
enough to eat.

435
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,413
So of course he's,
his cognition is a little bit on the 

436
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:17,420
adult side because he's going through 
periods of starvation and drunkenness.

437
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,254
So it's not like he's thinking that 
clearly he wants to become a law 

438
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,473
students so that it can help society.
And he finds out that his sister is 

439
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:25,694
basically willing to enter into a 
loveless marriage and more or less 

440
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,464
prostitute herself so that she can 
generate enough money to share with her 

441
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,580
mother so that they can fund his 
continuation through law school.

442
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,280
And he thinks that wouldn't be a very 
good deal.

443
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,600
At the same time,
he's indebted a pawn broker who everyone

444
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:48,450
hates,
who is an absolutely miserable person in

445
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,284
every possible way.
And Dostoevsky sets up the situation 

446
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,330
like that.
So the pawn broker has a niece,

447
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:55,164
if I remember correctly,
who she basically in slaves and miss 

448
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,014
treats and she squat squirrels away all 
sorts of money but never does anything 

449
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:03,480
with it,
lives in absolute poverty.

450
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,313
And anyways,
he considers her the sort of person 

451
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,930
without whom the world would be a better
place.

452
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,130
So having all of these things co 
occurring in his imagination,

453
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,160
he decides that because there are no 
ultimate arbiters of value,

454
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,810
that all morality is essentially 
cowardice,

455
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,710
which is kind of the reverse of what 
needs to concluded.

456
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,053
See,
said most people were cowardly and 

457
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,244
justified that with their morality,
but responding to cough took the other 

458
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,091
idea,
which is,

459
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:33,924
well,
why do I have to obey any rules at all 

460
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,610
if there's no ultimate source for any of
these rules,

461
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,170
it's just convention and cowardice.
And if I have enough strength,

462
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,500
then I can leave outside of that 
framework and I can do whatever I want.

463
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,890
So he decides to kill the pawnbroker,
which he does and quite successfully.

464
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:52,974
And not only that,
he gets away with it and that's about 

465
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,940
the first third of crime and punishment.

466
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,773
And the rest of the book is that the 
discussion of the manner in which he 

467
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:05,190
comes unglued as a consequence of having
performed this act.

468
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:06,990
And it's,
it's a brilliant,

469
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,003
it's absolutely brilliant study of the 
way that a value system holds you 

470
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,260
together even in ways that you don't 
know.

471
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,770
And then if you step outside of that 
and,

472
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,663
and,
and violate your relationship to it in 

473
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,374
some really intense way,
then there's going to be catastrophic 

474
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:28,850
psychological consequences that will 
echo through your whole being.

475
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:29,684
You know,
we know that this is more than theory 

476
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,353
because many people,
soldiers in particular who developed 

477
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:39,870
post traumatic stress disorder,
developed post traumatic stress disorder

478
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:40,704
when they observe themselves doing 
something that they regard as 

479
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,160
tremendously cruel or vicious or 
immoral.

480
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,650
You know,
when they're in the situation where,

481
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,933
you know,
uh,

482
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,690
acting that acting in that manner is 
highly probable.

483
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,990
It's a war situation is usually very 
intense and you know,

484
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:01,620
they don't have a lot of time to make 
decisions and God only knows,

485
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,440
you know,
what the specifics are of the particular

486
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,450
event.
But many,

487
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:07,284
many people come to be so shattered by 
observing themselves do things they 

488
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,150
can't believe that a human being would 
be capable of doing that.

489
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,100
They never recovered.
And it's partly because you know,

490
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,450
they violate their,
their ethical,

491
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,190
the ethical structure that holds them 
together holds older ideas and their,

492
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,750
their plans and their perceptions and 
their interactions with other people.

493
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,340
That's a unified field in some sense.
And if you violate it and it fragments,

494
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,030
then you're left absolutely fragmented.
Then that's,

495
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,913
that's not,
that's not even a psychological 

496
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,750
observation.
It's a psychophysiological observation.

497
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,643
You can stress yourself so badly,
raise your stress level so high that 

498
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,640
your brain starts to become damaged by 
the stress hormones.

499
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,990
And you know,
so it's,

500
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,380
it's not just a psychological state,
it's,

501
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,740
it's damage to the core of your being in
some sense.

502
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,100
Now,
the collapse of these belief systems and

503
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:06,934
their destabilization was well thought 
through by these thinkers by the end of 

504
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,554
the 19th century.
And then w we have the technological 

505
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,644
transformations and the,
and the sociological and political 

506
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,920
transformations of the early part of the
20th century.

507
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:25,360
That leaves everyone in a state of 
confusion in some sense.

508
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,194
Like in Germany in the 1920s of course 
the Germans had gone through this 

509
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,070
terrible period of trench warfare.
So they're all,

510
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,904
their men were brutalized,
some of them had been on the front for 

511
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,630
months and that was in the trenches.
And then,

512
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,090
you know,
their political system had collapsed and

513
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,090
they put a week weekly rooted democracy 
in place.

514
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,310
And then the economic system collapsed 
in Germany,

515
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,960
went through a period of hyperinflation.

516
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,793
So that money,
the value of their money basically 

517
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,124
dropped to zero.
And so that meant that if you were 65 

518
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,144
years old and had saved up your whole 
life to have enough money to retire and 

519
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,650
we're a good citizen,
you know,

520
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,060
and,
and prudent and careful,

521
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,570
every single thing you ever own 
disappeared.

522
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,450
And so at the same time,
you know,

523
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,573
the communist revolution had taken place
in Soviet Russia and there was great 

524
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,220
concern within Germany that the same 
thing was likely to happen there.

525
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:20,221
And certainly that the communists were 
always pushing for that because they had

526
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,394
the common term,
which is the international communist 

527
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:23,824
movement,
which was devoted towards the 

528
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,820
stabilizing,
you know,

529
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,663
non communist governments and,
and producing the preconditions for the 

530
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:31,770
revolution.
So it wasn't,

531
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,480
wasn't like it was just paranoia.
It was a real threat.

532
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,880
And it was out of all that mess that 
came,

533
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:39,250
the emergence of the fascists and the 
Nazis.

534
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,880
And it's not that,
you know,

535
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,743
it's,
it's not that surprising because chaos 

536
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:47,560
breeds the desire for order.
And so that was what,

537
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:50,380
that was one direction that people could
go,

538
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:51,214
you know,
instead of following an abstract 

539
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,770
Messiah,
let's say,

540
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:57,670
the sort of of idea that was embedded in
classical Christianity,

541
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,000
they realized the new Messiah not was 
Hitler.

542
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,580
And that certainly didn't seem to be any
improvement,

543
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,073
you know,
because Hitler was really a messiah of 

544
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:07,414
destruction and fire and you know,
the World War II who killed about 120 

545
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,723
million people.
And of course it left Germany in 

546
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,464
absolute ruins.
And Hitler killed himself in his bunker 

547
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:17,674
underneath Berlin while it was burning.
And the Russians were advancing into 

548
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:20,891
the,
you know,

549
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:25,891
into Germany and they were not happy.
You didn't want to be a German national.

550
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,063
Well,
the Soviets were advancing towards you 

551
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:30,700
after your con,
after your country to invaded.

552
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,910
There's push them back halfway across 
the Soviet Union,

553
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,163
you know,
and produced a tremendous amount of 

554
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:40,160
damage and distress.
It was an situation,

555
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,743
you know,
and uh,

556
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,033
the Messiah is that the,
that the Russians turned to Lenin and 

557
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:51,410
Stalin were barbaric and brutal be on 
comprehension.

558
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,011
You know,
and it's,

559
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,110
it's a strange thing,
you know,

560
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,020
we're not very well educated in what 
happened in this,

561
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,913
in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.
We know far more about what happened in 

562
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:03,110
Germany,
say with the Holocaust.

563
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:03,944
And you know,
it's very important that people should 

564
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:06,224
know about that.
But there were tens of millions of 

565
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,850
people brutally destroyed in the Soviet 
Union.

566
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:11,684
And you know,
partly because they were murdered by 

567
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,780
people who were,
at least in principle,

568
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:22,670
motivated by left wing Utopian visions.
We seem to,

569
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,200
our education system seems to regard 
that as somehow more forgivable,

570
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,350
which it certainly isn't.
So,

571
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,240
you know,
the whole,

572
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,133
the whole generate second or 
alternatives to religious belief issue 

573
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,240
didn't seem to work out very well.

574
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,160
And then the nihilism alternative,
well that has its own problems.

575
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:43,994
You know,
one problem is the sort of dusty Esky 

576
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,330
talked about,
you know,

577
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,790
and you see the kids who go up and 
shoot,

578
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,720
shoot up high schools and,
and exploded in rage.

579
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,033
You know,
they're often people who feel that they 

580
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,074
have no meaning in their life,
that life itself was contemptible and 

581
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,760
that suffering is too extreme and that 
they're,

582
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,690
they're,
they're,

583
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,960
they bear the brunt of unfair reality.
And you know,

584
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:10,961
they develop unbelievably dark and,
and destructive theories of,

585
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,250
of revenge and may ham over sometimes 
over the period of years.

586
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:18,980
And then they go up in the world and lay
those things out.

587
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,430
And it's not like they're thinking is 
irrational,

588
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,980
you know,
it's coherent.

589
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,820
It's just predicated on principles that 
you might not agree with such as,

590
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,700
you know,
the principle that everyone that I don't

591
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,060
like deserves to die.

592
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,740
But you know,
in the absence of a really formal way of

593
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,020
demonstrating that such thoughts are not
only immoral but wrong,

594
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,883
you know,
in some absolute sense it's very 

595
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:44,804
difficult to come up with ways of 
defending ourselves against those two 

596
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:48,690
extremes.
You know,

597
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,660
the extremes of destructive vitalism and
the extremes of ideological possession.

598
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,250
Now,
nature started to work out some,

599
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,173
some solutions to this.
And I just started to touch on those at 

600
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,460
the end of the last lecture.
Um,

601
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,973
you know,
Dostoyevsky solution was a return to 

602
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,910
Christianity fundamentally,
and it's revivification.

603
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,763
And that was the same tack that 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn attempted to lay 

604
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,660
out and also tolstoy in Russia.
You know,

605
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,560
and,
and I'll talk to you about that a little

606
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,394
bit more in the next lecture,
dusty or niches idea was that people 

607
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,780
would have to,
he said,

608
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:27,614
you know,
when his quote about the death of God 

609
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:29,474
that people would have to become light,
God's just to be able to tolerate the 

610
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,450
consequences of this dismemberment of 
the previous civilization.

611
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,490
And he believed,
well,

612
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,630
his thinking on this,
I would say is,

613
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,440
is somewhat fragmentary.
I mean,

614
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:49,890
nature was a great critic of 
Christianity,

615
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:53,280
institutionalized Christianity,
and a great diagnostician.

616
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,114
He could say what was rotten at the core
of western civilization will say modern 

617
00:35:58,681 --> 00:35:59,514
civilization.
But when it came to actually describing 

618
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,440
what to do about it,
well,

619
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,360
he didn't live that long,
you know,

620
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,194
he died a fairly young man.
There's actually a video of nature in 

621
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:12,690
the mental hospital online.
I just found it the other night.

622
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,540
I have no idea that he was ever a 
captured on video.

623
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,541
But there's video from movie from 1899 
showing him in the mental hospital where

624
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:25,971
he ended up in his early forties so he 
talked about the development of the,

625
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,620
of the being.
He called the over man,

626
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,454
which is often translated as super band.
And his idea was that people would have 

627
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,280
to take onto themselves the,
the,

628
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,173
the burden of creating new systems of 
meaning and new morality's that were 

629
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:43,914
suited to them,
that they would have to create new 

630
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:46,950
values.

631
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,980
Now,
young took niches,

632
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,800
diagnosis very,
very seriously.

633
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:56,634
And you can,
you can certainly say that Ewan was as 

634
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:00,920
much influenced by niche as he was by 
Freud.

635
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:01,754
And I would say in some ways he was 
influenced more because one of the 

636
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:09,861
things that yoga was trying to do was to
identify where the lost values had gone.

637
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,843
So the Nietzsche and idea is that it's 
possible for human beings to create 

638
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:17,304
their own values.
Now there's a problem with that and 

639
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,750
there's a variety of problems with that.
And one is that it's,

640
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,790
it doesn't seem exactly true in that,
you know,

641
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,624
and,
and a lot of the existentialists who 

642
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:34,320
followed feature like John Paul Sartre,
for example,

643
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,560
believed in the radical freedom of human
beings that we were,

644
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,710
we were doomed to be free in a sense.
And that was absolutely necessary for us

645
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,154
to conjure up our own meanings and 
values because fundamentally we faced 

646
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:48,170
the void.

647
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,850
And you know,
life was nasty,

648
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,684
brutish and short to use hobbs terms.
And that we had to be able to confront 

649
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:59,520
that and live despite it.
And well,

650
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,950
there's a variety of problems with that 
solution.

651
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,330
The first one is,
well,

652
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,370
if you come up with your system of 
values,

653
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:07,860
there's no reason.
And I come up with mine,

654
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,630
there's no reason to assume that they're
going to be sufficiently integratable so

655
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,850
that we don't have to fight each other 
to the death.

656
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,350
That's a big problem.
So you know,

657
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:19,980
you'd have every single person with 
their own system of beliefs.

658
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,480
Well,
fine extent.

659
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,250
How do you know that?
In a sense,

660
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:26,010
that's a structured kind of 
philosophical anarchy.

661
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,690
Well,
okay,

662
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,270
maybe that's good if you happen to live 
alone on an island,

663
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,580
but if you're stuck with all these other
people,

664
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,920
then that becomes a very difficult thing
to,

665
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
and I think it's partly for that reason 
that Sartre famously said,

666
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,430
hell is other people,
you know?

667
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,263
Because he thought of the other in some 
sense that which was not him as an 

668
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,593
oppressive force that stopped him from 
manifesting his destiny in the way that 

669
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,530
would it be best for him?
Well,

670
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,650
you know,
hell might be other people,

671
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,470
but that doesn't mean that,
first of all,

672
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,304
that's a very one sided way of looking 
at things because of course hell is 

673
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,900
other people.
Hell is you two.

674
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,820
And you know,
hell is nature.

675
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,800
There's lots of places you can find 
hell.

676
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:11,170
But by the same token,
you know,

677
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,273
the most meaningful elements of people's
lives are often their social 

678
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:18,370
relationships.
And you can't lay everything at the door

679
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:20,650
of pathological society.
You know,

680
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,590
and we shouldn't forget as well that 
Sartre didn't,

681
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,133
uh,
what come up with any reasonable 

682
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:31,030
critique of the communists until the 
late 1960s.

683
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:31,481
But,
you know,

684
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:32,770
but,
and that was a little late.

685
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,663
People with any sense,
like George Orwell had figured out that 

686
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:41,371
the whole Soviet experiment had become 
radically murderous by the early 1940s.

687
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,530
And so starcher pr,
you know,

688
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,430
proposed radical freedom as a,
as a,

689
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,100
as the existential response to the 
unveiling of no meaning.

690
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,180
But when it came right down to it,
he couldn't resist identification with a

691
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,014
totalitarian structure.
So I don't see any reason why we should 

692
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,400
really pay any attention to what he had 
to say.

693
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,950
So now there's another problem with the 
idea that people should create their own

694
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,920
values.
And that is that it's not so simple.

695
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,443
You know?
And the problem seems to be is that you 

696
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:17,560
don't obey yourself very well.
You know,

697
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:18,700
you can say,
well,

698
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,160
here's my code.
I'm going to live by it.

699
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:21,994
So,
and we let's do that simply to begin 

700
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,011
with.
You say,

701
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:27,700
well,
I'm going to study very hard and do well

702
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,340
at my classes just for the sake of 
argument that you know,

703
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,290
but you don't,
you know,

704
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,124
you procrastinate and you have a paper 
you're supposed to read and you know 

705
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,454
you're supposed to read it and you need 
to read it for reasons that are even 

706
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,480
hypothetically important to you.

707
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,570
But there's no damn way you could get 
yourself to sit down and read it.

708
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,400
Your attention wanders and you go to do 
three or four stupid things and you feel

709
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,234
terrible about it.
Like you feel like you're betraying 

710
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,500
yourself.
And maybe this is a continual pattern in

711
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,334
your life,
but one of the things you find out is 

712
00:40:55,991 --> 00:40:56,824
that you don't get to create your own 
damn values because for some reason 

713
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:02,560
you're not in charge of yourself.
And of course,

714
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,140
that's where the psychoanalytic ideas 
start to come from.

715
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,490
You know,
Freud notices.

716
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,353
This is in the aftermath of nature,
that you're not the master of your own 

717
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,490
psyche.
You know that there's,

718
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,640
there's many sub use inside of you and 
they don't all want the same thing.

719
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:22,270
And so the idea that you can generate 
your own meaning is very,

720
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,393
it's,
it's insufficiently developed idea 

721
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
because there's a lot of meaning making 
generators residing within you.

722
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,630
And not only do they not all point in 
the same direction,

723
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,260
which is a huge problem,
but they don't even necessarily,

724
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,153
they don't necessarily lay themselves 
out in some integrated fashion across 

725
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:48,440
time and they don't necessarily operate 
together in a way that's going to enable

726
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:51,410
you to find your place with other people
and in society.

727
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,740
So you know,
make your own meaning.

728
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,450
Well,
which part of you,

729
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,550
you don't,
you're not a unified thing.

730
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,533
So that's a big problem.
And then all these other problems just 

731
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,820
remain unaddressed completely.
Well,

732
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,683
one answer to that,
and this is the answer that the more 

733
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:12,710
radical existentialist took as well.
Society has to be reconfigured.

734
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,860
But you know,
we kind of know where that leads to when

735
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:18,950
people are doing radical societal 
reconfiguration,

736
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:21,020
at least as far as we've been able to 
tell.

737
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,973
Most of the time,
that's an absolute murderous 

738
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,250
catastrophe.

739
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,230
So,
you know,

740
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:28,064
it's reasonable.
It seems reasonable to me to presume 

741
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,880
that,
that those experiments have already been

742
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,580
run.
All right,

743
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:35,414
so now une,
like Dostoyevsky was very interested in 

744
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:40,844
returning to sources of meaning from 
which he believed that our original 

745
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,723
religious ideas had emerged.
And this is partly his notion of the 

746
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:51,380
collective unconscious.
So,

747
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,513
you know,
part of the radical critique of 

748
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:56,024
religious systems is predicated on the 
idea that there's something like 

749
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:00,350
conscious beliefs.
You know,

750
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:04,610
they're articulated beliefs that you 
could lay out in a credo,

751
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,800
but,
but that's not right.

752
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,630
It doesn't seem to be correct at all.
And Neat.

753
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:09,464
She actually knew this.
He knew that a lot of our social 

754
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:16,481
institutions had emerged from the bottom
up and had only become articulated after

755
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,710
they'd been embodied in,
danced out.

756
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,640
Essentially,
you know,

757
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,743
you,
you are a tribal group learns how to 

758
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,164
organize itself over thousands and 
thousands of years of trial and error 

759
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,150
and pushing against each other and so 
forth.

760
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,983
And they come into that tribal grouping 
with a biological substrate and there 

761
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,683
are sociological and political 
interactions are constrained by all of 

762
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:39,644
those things.
And then maybe they come up with a 

763
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:41,654
description of that over time,
the self description and an articulated 

764
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:47,780
representation.
And that's the religious system.

765
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,153
It's not that the religious system is 
thought up first as a system of 

766
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:55,850
metaphysical presuppositions,
images and dreams,

767
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,590
then turn it into rules then imposed on 
the population who then obeys it.

768
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,440
And generally speaking,
when people criticized,

769
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,930
um,
formal religion,

770
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,063
they criticized it.
Assuming that that's how it had 

771
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:09,861
developed,
you know,

772
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:12,140
and that's kind of a Marxist idea,
for example,

773
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:14,510
that religion is the opiate of the 
masses and that,

774
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,793
you know,
the religious structures were laid out 

775
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,330
so that a small elite could control the 
population.

776
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,920
Now,
you know,

777
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,950
in virtually every domain,
a small elite emerges that dominates the

778
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:30,140
population.
I don't care what domain you look at.

779
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:33,960
So mark's is accurate in that way in 
that,

780
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,100
you know,
there's always a power imbalance between

781
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:38,943
elite minority and a non elite majority.
But to say that that's the cause of all 

782
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,680
the systems that people interact with it
as well.

783
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:50,514
And it's,
it's,

784
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,120
it's,
I'm sophisticated beyond belief.

785
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:53,954
What it does is it takes phenomena that 
are complex beyond comprehension and 

786
00:44:57,351 --> 00:44:59,660
reduce them to one thing.
It's not helpful.

787
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,620
Like,
you know,

788
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,610
here's an example.

789
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,263
MMM.

790
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,820
If you,
if you sampled popular songs on the,

791
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:10,654
on Youtube,
let's say you made a graph of how 

792
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:12,814
popular songs were,
what you find is that about 10 songs at 

793
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:19,570
any given time are played.

794
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,143
Half of all the songs played at any 
given time are going to be one of 10 

795
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:27,190
songs.
Well,

796
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,024
and then what,
the other thing you'd find is that half 

797
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:34,111
of all songs played are played by one or
more of 10 musicians.

798
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,010
And that's true.
No matter,

799
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,873
you know,
if you look all the way from the 1930s 

800
00:45:38,231 --> 00:45:40,120
to now,
if you look at popular music,

801
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:40,954
you see the same thing.
Almost everything that almost everyone 

802
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,600
listens to is created by very few 
people.

803
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,880
And then there's millions of musicians,
but you've never heard of most of them.

804
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:53,610
And you'll never hear a song.
For most,

805
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,933
it's a small minority.
And what you see as in any field of 

806
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:59,410
creative production,
this happens.

807
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,880
A small elite emerges and dominates the 
entire landscape.

808
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,520
Now,
you know,

809
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:08,890
it's kind of,
it would be kind of ridiculous to assume

810
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,724
that the 10 most popular singers and 
musicians that are currently operative 

811
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:14,944
word,
those who gave rise to the system that 

812
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:18,070
allowed them to thrive.

813
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,610
I mean,
obviously that's a dopey idea and it's,

814
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:22,360
it's,
it's,

815
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,193
it's no more an intelligent idea of when
you look at any other domain where 

816
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:30,010
there's tremendous variation and the 
emergence of an elite,

817
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,590
it's a very common phenomenon.
It happens,

818
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:34,210
as I said,
it happens anywhere.

819
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:37,570
There's creative production.
And so that's why 1% of the people,

820
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:38,470
you know,
roughly half,

821
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:42,520
50% of the money,
it's no different than in other creative

822
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:45,760
domains.
Now we'll talk later in the course about

823
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,594
why that happens,
but to think it's because those people 

824
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:53,470
set up the system.
So that they could thrive as well.

825
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,800
There's an element of that obviously,
because once you're rich,

826
00:46:56,801 --> 00:47:01,630
you're going to prefer political 
policies that help you stay rich.

827
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,050
But that doesn't mean that you set up 
the whole damn system that made you rich

828
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:06,300
to begin with.
Plastics,

829
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,030
not the same people over any reasonable 
span of time.

830
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,060
So the 1% of people who have most of the
money,

831
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,330
it's always 1% but it's not the same 
people.

832
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,193
You know,
each in individuals tend to hold on to 

833
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:23,590
money for very short periods of time and
big companies don't last very long.

834
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,340
You know,
they,

835
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,210
they last on average about 30,
35 40 years and that's it.

836
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,220
Then they disappeared.
So when it's,

837
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:31,054
because you know,
the economic landscape is just churning 

838
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,790
like Mac,
it's very difficult for a company to,

839
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:37,983
you know,
there's not that many big steam coach 

840
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,470
companies anymore,
you know,

841
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:41,951
and,
and,

842
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,210
and nobody makes zeppelins and nobody 
makes typewriters.

843
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:48,190
And you know what I mean?
It's things move quick.

844
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:49,024
And just because you dominated the 
landscape at one particular moment 

845
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,170
doesn't mean you're going to be able to 
do it that the nest.

846
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,750
So,
all right,

847
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,330
so the create your own meaning thing is 
a rough one.

848
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,523
And then there's another problem too,
which is what makes you think you have 

849
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,690
enough time?
You know,

850
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,543
lots of times people come to me and they
have relationship problems and part of 

851
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:10,864
the problem is,
is that they've set their relationships 

852
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:16,090
up outside of social norms and they do 
that.

853
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,160
And also they'll say something to me,
something like,

854
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,293
well,
we're not going to get married because 

855
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:23,950
marriage is just a piece of paper,
which is really a stupid thing to say.

856
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,960
Like it's an incredibly stupid thing to 
say.

857
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,973
But underneath that there's this idea 
that they want to remain free of social 

858
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:33,400
constraints so that they can negotiate 
their own way.

859
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,170
Like if you're giving them credit for,
you know,

860
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,930
wanting freedom instead of just escaping
responsibility.

861
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,270
But the problem with that is it's like,
okay,

862
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,340
good luck.
Try it.

863
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,833
I don't know why.
You would assume that you have enough 

864
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:46,744
time in the 30 or 40 years that you're 
going to be pursuing relationships to 

865
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:53,050
actually figure out how they should run.

866
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,900
You don't have a hope of that.
And it's worse too,

867
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:58,960
because very,
very few people can negotiate,

868
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,830
you know?
Because the,

869
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,550
here's the way it works.
New.

870
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:07,780
Either adhere to the social order or you
stand outside of it.

871
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,333
As soon as you stand outside of it,
you're in a chaotic place because 

872
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:12,424
there's no guidelines.
And then you either live chaotically 

873
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:19,600
because there's no guidelines or you 
start to formulate order.

874
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,123
But to do that,
you have to know what you want and you 

875
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,594
have to know how to express it.
And then you have to figure out what 

876
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:31,810
your partner wants and help them express
it.

877
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:34,030
And then you have to negotiate a 
solution.

878
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,470
Well,
I would say one in 20 people know how to

879
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,660
negotiate.
It's really,

880
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:41,950
really difficult.
If you mean,

881
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:43,510
just think of the steps.
First of all,

882
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:46,540
you have to know what you want and then 
you have to admit it to yourself.

883
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,410
Well,
yeah,

884
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:48,490
right.
Like,

885
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,533
you can't,
you're not even going to get to the 

886
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,930
first one in all likelihood.
What do you want?

887
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,350
A lot of what you want can't be 
articulated even,

888
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,270
you know,
I'll give you an example.

889
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,280
So there's a great study done a while 
back on prediction of,

890
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,370
of,
of a relationship longevity.

891
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,310
Okay.
So here was the question.

892
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,703
Um,
how many negative interactions do you 

893
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:16,960
have to have per set of positive?
Sorry?

894
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,770
How many positive interactions per 
negative interaction do you have to have

895
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,430
with your partner in order for the 
relationship to remain stable?

896
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,403
Okay,
so let's say you have one negative 

897
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,040
interaction to every one positive 
interaction.

898
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,933
Okay.
Or maybe have 10 negatives to every 

899
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:33,914
positive.
Then you can imagine a different 

900
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,700
situation where you have a hundred 
positive to one naked,

901
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,400
right?
Spanning the whole potential continue.

902
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,360
And you use that to predict relationship
satisfaction and longevity.

903
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,740
Well,
you might think,

904
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:46,574
well God,
obviously a hundred positive to one 

905
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:52,190
negative is where is the preferable 
ratio.

906
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:54,500
And so it's those people who,
you know,

907
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:58,670
their relationship is nothing but 
constant compliments and bliss.

908
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,710
They're the ones who last.
It's not true.

909
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,820
What you see is that there's a,
there's a,

910
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:07,910
an optimal,
an optimal ratio domain.

911
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,170
If it falls below five to one,
positive to negative,

912
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,980
then your relationship falls apart.
It's too negative.

913
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,233
And it's partly because people feel 
negative emotion more than they feel 

914
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:23,630
positive emotion because you can be hurt
more than you can be pleased.

915
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,550
And so one that's only five to one is to
punishing and people won't,

916
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,790
won't stay in.
But if you get above 11 to one,

917
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,230
it gets not punishing enough.
And you think,

918
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:37,670
well,
what does that mean exactly?

919
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,040
Well,
what do you want in a relationship?

920
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,970
While you think bliss,
it's like that isn't what you want.

921
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,803
As it turns out,
it's more like he wants someone to 

922
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:47,660
contend with,
you know,

923
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:48,494
you don't want to push over.
You don't want everything just to be 

924
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:51,471
easy.
You know?

925
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,180
And this is the sort of,
um,

926
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,543
the sort of phenomena that kierkegaard 
was talking about when he talked about 

927
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,574
deciding to make things more difficult 
for people because that's what they 

928
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,000
need.
You know,

929
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:06,080
you know this perfectly well because if 
you go out with someone and they worship

930
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:06,914
you and they don't on your every word 
and there's nothing but positive 

931
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,483
feedback coming from them,
you lose respect for them almost an 

932
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:15,770
instantly and you go wander off and find
someone who's more interesting.

933
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,203
And part of the reason for that I think 
is that you want the person that you're 

934
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,404
with to challenge you so that not only 
do you do reasonably well data gate day 

935
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,530
together,
you know,

936
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:32,120
so that you can coexist in the same 
space with a reasonable amount of pace.

937
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,193
But you also want there to be enough 
tension in the relationship so that 

938
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,080
you're both involved in a process of 
mutual transformation.

939
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,560
Well try specifying that in an 
articulated way.

940
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,450
You know,
good luck,

941
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,613
you know?
And it also explains strange things 

942
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:50,900
about people like the fact that they'll 
stay in pretty negative relationships.

943
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,734
Like what the hell are you doing there?
If you had articulated it two years ago 

944
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:56,151
and you said,
well,

945
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,450
I want to be with someone,
I'm miserable with half the time,

946
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,760
of course you're never going to say 
that.

947
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,040
But it could easily be that that's what 
you're after.

948
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,760
So well,
so,

949
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,270
alright,
now heidegger is another philosopher who

950
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,833
was attempting in some sense to solve 
the problems that were laid out by 

951
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:19,484
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.
And the way that heidegger heidegger 

952
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,300
began to resolve them was by taking a 
radically new lockout philosophy itself.

953
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,680
And
he was,

954
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:32,514
he was,
he was one of the prime 

955
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,943
phenomenologists.
And I told you a while back that the 

956
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:42,021
phenomenologists decided to re 
constitute Western philosophy.

957
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:45,630
So that was focusing on being instead of
knowledge.

958
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,913
And so the hardest thing to grasp about 
the phenomenologists is what exactly 

959
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:54,180
they meant by being.
And so I'll give you a,

960
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,223
I'll give you a overview of that.
So that's where the term dad sign comes 

961
00:53:58,531 --> 00:53:59,364
from.
And that's a German term and it means 

962
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,074
being there.
And so right now you're encapsulated in 

963
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:07,740
a dad side and the design is the 
totality of your experience.

964
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,870
And that experience would be an 
experience of the extended world,

965
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,120
the natural world,
and then the social world.

966
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,650
And then inside that the world of your 
subjective experience.

967
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,810
And that constitutes be it.
And the phenomenologists make the case.

968
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,590
They're not playing this subject object 
gate and they're standing outside of the

969
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:33,210
division between subject and object.

970
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,040
That's part of the scientific world 
view.

971
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,640
So it's a real paradigm shift in that 
you can't use the rules from the old way

972
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:44,010
of looking at things inside the new way 
of looking at things.

973
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:46,490
You have to start with new 
presuppositions.

974
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:50,220
So we might say,
well one of the things that you're going

975
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,054
to do if you look at things 
phenomenologically is to assume that 

976
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:57,000
everything that you experience is real.
So,

977
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,433
so then we would say that there's no 
attempt in that phenomenological world 

978
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:03,564
to reduce pain to something material.
Pain stands as stands itself as a 

979
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,680
phenomena.
So does anxiety.

980
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:14,460
So does joy.
All the things that that scientists have

981
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:19,461
consciousness call quallies,
which are viewed by them as qualities of

982
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:23,010
the objective world aren't viewed that 
way by the phenomenologists.

983
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,250
They just say those are primary elements
of being.

984
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,043
So it's a very interesting way of 
looking at things because it kind of 

985
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,960
allows you to reclaim the validity of 
your own experience.

986
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,490
You can no longer say,
well,

987
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:36,324
that's only subjective,
and that doesn't mean that everything 

988
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:44,781
you play him subjectively is true 
objectively or for other people.

989
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,763
What it does mean is that everything 
that you experience subjectively is 

990
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:51,204
real.
Now that doesn't mean you have to not 

991
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,190
think about it or take it apart or 
categorize it properly.

992
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:57,870
You still have to do all of those 
things,

993
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,440
but you're,
you're put into a place where there's no

994
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:04,674
need to deny the reality of your own 
experience or to subordinate it to 

995
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:11,220
something else.
So for example,

996
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,740
if I'm doing dream analysis with 
someone,

997
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,530
which I do often,
if people dream,

998
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,750
because dreams as young pointed out are 
there,

999
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,180
they,
they're,

1000
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,640
they're manifestations of being,
you don't come up with them,

1001
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,743
they appear to you.
They sort of appear out of nowhere in 

1002
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,550
some sense.
They manifest themselves,

1003
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,110
they do it strangely.

1004
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:37,600
And I think the reason for that is that 
they contain unarticulated thought.

1005
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,130
But if you can get a handle on them and 
assess them,

1006
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:45,130
then sometimes they can tell you things 
that there's no other way you can figure

1007
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:45,964
out.
And what's really cool about them is 

1008
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:47,854
that they're,
they have the same impersonality as 

1009
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:53,404
phenomena in the,
like the broader world of experience 

1010
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:58,631
have,
you know,

1011
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:01,420
you don't ever think about the truth of 
a chair.

1012
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,480
It's just there.
And dreams are like that.

1013
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:05,314
They're just there.
And if you can untangle what they have 

1014
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:09,610
to,
what they indicate,

1015
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:14,500
then you can get a take on your own 
experience that's not

1016
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,120
altered by any of your local subjective 
wishes and desires.

1017
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:26,870
I hate to use the word subjective in 
this sort of context.

1018
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,490
So phenomenology is the study of being 
now,

1019
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,120
now and in being,
there are a variety of aspects.

1020
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,300
So one aspect,
I never remember the names of these,

1021
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:41,210
but I'll get it here right away.
Oh yes.

1022
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,113
Uh,
heidegger broke the world of experience 

1023
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,860
being into three basic categories.
There was the unwelcomed,

1024
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,360
which I think is basically the world 
beyond culture and the individual.

1025
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:58,790
There's the mid dwelt and that's the 
world that we share with everyone else.

1026
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:01,460
So that's roughly the social world and 
the social structures.

1027
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:02,294
And then there's the eigen value,
which is that domain of experience 

1028
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:08,000
that's unique to you that other people 
can't partake in.

1029
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:09,343
So those are the elements of being,
as far as the phenomenologists were 

1030
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,143
concerned.
And in those domains of being different 

1031
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,083
experiences manifest themselves.
We talked about some of the ones that 

1032
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,250
would be manifestations of the,

1033
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,133
I can belt

1034
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,230
scientists would call those things 
emotional or motivational states.

1035
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,020
Normally people think of them as 
feelings.

1036
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,540
I would say.
I feel that's,

1037
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:39,403
I feel such and such.
And those are experiences that that 

1038
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,620
manifest themselves to you or that you 
have,

1039
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:46,454
depending on how you look at it,
that are indicative of the manner in 

1040
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:53,900
which you should act in relationship to 
being.

1041
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,900
Now,
one of,

1042
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,340
part of the reason that this is relevant
to psychotherapy in particular,

1043
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:03,080
it was because of the,
the,

1044
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,914
uh,
the phenomenologists were very 

1045
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:07,910
interested in the manifestation of 
meaning.

1046
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,490
So you could say,
well,

1047
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,163
nihilism is the absence of meaning and 
totalitarianism is the fixed headedness 

1048
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,270
of meaning,
right?

1049
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,850
If you're a totalitarian,
what you do is say,

1050
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,510
all exist in relationship to this 
structure.

1051
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:26,870
It's almost as if from the 
phenomenologists would say you're trying

1052
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,540
to reduce the,
the weld,

1053
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:33,150
which is the natural world,
the Mip Weld,

1054
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,570
which is the social world and the Eigen 
belt,

1055
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:36,440
which is your own world.

1056
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,273
You're trying to reduce all of that to 
the Midwest so that everything falls 

1057
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:45,140
under an explanation that's granted to 
you by some higher authority.

1058
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,160
And,
and then of course the nihilists art are

1059
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,780
having none of that.
They see,

1060
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,800
they,
they,

1061
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,813
they use their eigen felt,
I would say their own world to 

1062
00:59:57,351 --> 01:00:02,351
invalidate meaning in any domain.
Now the phenomenologists would say,

1063
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:03,344
well,
it's a mistake to use your rationality 

1064
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,750
to undermine the,
the,

1065
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,250
the sense,
the manifestation of meaning.

1066
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,323
And I can give you an example of that.
So let's say you're a good nihilist and 

1067
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:18,530
you think that maybe you're going to go 
do something difficult,

1068
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,364
like put yourself through university,
and then you think in a relatively 

1069
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,923
depressed state of mind,
maybe you encounter some obstacles of 

1070
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:28,400
one form or another,
and you think,

1071
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,630
oh,
to hell with this.

1072
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,990
Who's,
what difference does it make anyways?

1073
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,700
Who cares if I go and get my degree?
You know,

1074
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:35,683
none of this knowledge is particularly 
relevant or meaningful and who the hell 

1075
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,040
is going to know the difference in a 
million years?

1076
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,840
And so you think,
well,

1077
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:44,490
that's a perfectly rational,
um,

1078
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,230
dismissal because who is going to know 
in a million years?

1079
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,430
Or let's say,
well,

1080
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:50,264
even if you could make a case that 
someone might know there might be some 

1081
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:53,654
effects left of you in a million years,
then we'll just multiply it by 100,000 

1082
01:00:57,861 --> 01:01:00,110
and go to a trillion years.
So here you are,

1083
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,080
you're this little tiny speck on a 
slight,

1084
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,923
you'd made your speck in the middle of a
galaxy that has god only knows how many 

1085
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,473
billion stars.
And then there's a billion of those 

1086
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:10,484
galaxies.
Although there's way more than that and 

1087
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,110
they're spread across this tremendous 
expansive time.

1088
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,530
And in the face of all that,
who cares what you do?

1089
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,040
Well,
what a phenomenologist would say is,

1090
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:22,874
okay,
let's look at how meaning manifests 

1091
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:32,260
itself when you alter your own

1092
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,223
private world in a variety of manners.
So let's say you're trying to do 

1093
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:42,460
something,
maybe you're working in a,

1094
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,720
maybe you're working as a volunteer in a
hospital helping sick kids,

1095
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:47,554
you know,
you're reading to them so that they're 

1096
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:51,550
distracted from their pain and you say,
well,

1097
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:53,770
in the trillion years,
who's going to know the difference?

1098
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:54,910
And so they think,
well,

1099
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,240
it's meaningless to do this.
And the phenomenologists would say,

1100
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,270
if the frame of reference that you're 
using,

1101
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,580
like if you're,
if you're imposing,

1102
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,003
if you're transforming the way you're 
being manifested itself so that it 

1103
01:02:09,431 --> 01:02:14,431
becomes meaningless and absurd,
then you should try experiencing it in a

1104
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:16,744
different manner.
So it's d c because a rationalist in 

1105
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:21,774
some sense,
the phenomenologists say a rationalist 

1106
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:27,240
can't deal with the argument.
What difference is it going to make an a

1107
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,260
trillion years?
And here you are,

1108
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:30,480
a little dust speck among all these 
other dust specs.

1109
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,870
It's ultimately meaningless.
A phenomenologist would say

1110
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,820
maximize the meaning.
That's the,

1111
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,030
that's the marker of truth.
And it's so,

1112
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,980
it's a completely different way of 
thinking about it.

1113
01:02:44,981 --> 01:02:45,880
So he,
he would say,

1114
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:46,714
for example,
that if you're going to a hospital and 

1115
01:02:49,091 --> 01:02:49,924
you're reading to sick children,
that the frame of reference that you 

1116
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:54,034
should use,
the way that you allow that experience 

1117
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:57,334
to manifest itself should be such that 
the experience manifests itself so that 

1118
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:06,550
it's as meaningful as possible rather 
than is meaning less.

1119
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,010
The idea being that just because you can

1120
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:13,203
twist your own experience so that 
certain elements of your being become 

1121
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:22,270
meaningless does not mean that that's 
right.

1122
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:23,763
The fact that it becomes meaningless 
actually means that it's wrong because 

1123
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:28,444
you think you see,
it all depends on what you allow to be 

1124
01:03:32,651 --> 01:03:35,140
primary,
and this is the phenomenologists point.

1125
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,620
If you allow your strict rationality,
it'd be primary.

1126
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:41,680
Then if it can attack something and 
destroy it,

1127
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:45,100
then that thing is worthy of being 
attacked and destroyed it.

1128
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,380
But if you flip it around and you say,
well,

1129
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:48,214
what you should be doing is allowing,
is interacting with your experience or 

1130
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:54,094
allowing your experience to manifest 
itself in a manner that situates you 

1131
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,343
most meaningfully in the here and now.
Whatever framework you're using to do 

1132
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,550
that,
that works is right.

1133
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,490
What's a completely different way of 
looking at things?

1134
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:12,550
And it's a real,
it's a real escape from the pathology of

1135
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:14,560
rationalism,
you know,

1136
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:19,561
because it isn't obvious that what you 
think should take priority.

1137
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,470
Now the phenomenologists would go 
farther than that.

1138
01:04:23,471 --> 01:04:25,990
They would say that,
and this is something.

1139
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,560
So here's a way of thinking about it.

1140
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:41,590
So been swinging your seven.
What we perceive our first and foremost,

1141
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:44,380
Vince Wanger was a psychiatrist who was 
very much influenced.

1142
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,633
It's why your advice where the people 
we're going to talk about mostly were 

1143
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:49,540
very much influenced by it.
Gary and ideas,

1144
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,853
they say,
what do we perceive our first and 

1145
01:04:52,841 --> 01:04:55,030
foremost,
not impressions of tastes,

1146
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:55,870
tone,
smell,

1147
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:58,390
or touch.
Not even things or objects,

1148
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,330
but meanings.
Okay,

1149
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,164
so the idea for the phenomenologists is 
that what being is made out of this 

1150
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:09,460
meaning it isn't that the objective 
world is made out of things.

1151
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:11,620
It's the being is made out of meaning.
Now,

1152
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:12,454
some of those meetings can be positive 
and some of them can be negative and 

1153
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:15,784
some of them can be neutral.
But the constituent elements of being 

1154
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,910
the fundamental constituent element of 
being as mean.

1155
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,490
And then there was an argument between 
bins,

1156
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:28,450
swagger and boss about how that meaning 
manifest itself.

1157
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:32,650
So been swagger would say that you endow
meaning on the world.

1158
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,573
So that's kind of a nichey and idea that
you create your own values so that you 

1159
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:41,821
have within you something he called an a
priori ontological structure.

1160
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,903
It's a world designed or a matrix of 
meaning that determines how the world 

1161
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:46,894
manifests itself to you.
Now the easiest way to think about that 

1162
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:53,620
is that you know you're thrown into a 
particular time and place.

1163
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:57,400
That's another existentialist idea.
And that's part of the absurdity of your

1164
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,234
life is that you're here.
Now in this particular context and 

1165
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,880
situation,
it's something you have to contend with.

1166
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,043
And that's true for everyone.
There arbitrary preconditions to 

1167
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:10,150
everyone's Ba.
And one of those arbitrary preconditions

1168
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:12,970
is the structure through which you look 
at the world.

1169
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:14,463
And that structure enables some things 
to be highlighted in some things to be 

1170
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:18,484
ignored.

1171
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:23,110
And so the way that meaning manifests 
itself is a reflection of this,

1172
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,153
a priori ontological structure.
And the primary mode of being so there 

1173
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,194
can't be being,
which is say your experience for the 

1174
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:33,274
sake of our argument,
without the structure that consists of 

1175
01:06:36,641 --> 01:06:38,410
the,
that that you consist of.

1176
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:39,903
And so that's a given and it's,
it's the action of that structure that 

1177
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:48,331
determines the meaning of things.
Now boss would say exactly the opposite.

1178
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:51,760
He would say that's the wrong way of 
looking at it.

1179
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,360
You should look at the totality of your 
existence,

1180
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:59,890
which is partly the broad natural world,
the cultural world,

1181
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:00,724
and your own world.
And you should note that meaning arises 

1182
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:06,700
in different places of its own accord.
You can't,

1183
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:11,320
you can't reduce it to the action,
say of this ontological,

1184
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:16,000
a priori ontological structure.
And so one example would be,

1185
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,673
well,
what about the meaning of things you 

1186
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:19,630
don't understand?

1187
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,573
Well,
it's hard to understand how the meaning 

1188
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:26,800
of things you don't understand can be 
attributed to what you understand.

1189
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,530
The meaning seems to be there to begin 
with.

1190
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:31,770
So here's an example.
You're,

1191
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,570
you're,
you have a relationship with someone and

1192
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:37,330
you discover that they have an affair.
Well,

1193
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,080
the discovery of the affair is going to 
be something that's meaningful.

1194
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,183
Now you don't know what the meaning is.
You're going to interpret it to begin 

1195
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:45,880
with,
likely very negatively,

1196
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,613
except to the degree that part of you 
would like to escape out of the 

1197
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:51,640
relationship,
right?

1198
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:52,474
Because sometimes if you're a betrayed,
you're happy about it because it's time 

1199
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,220
for that to be overweight.
But in any case,

1200
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,790
there are things that you can encounter 
that you don't understand,

1201
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:02,860
that are meaningful in and of 
themselves.

1202
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,353
So I think that you actually can't 
separate your structure from the 

1203
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:11,440
structure of everything.

1204
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,180
They're always interacting and meaning 
emerges out of the interplay of those.

1205
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:18,200
So here's another way of thinking about 
it.

1206
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,250
You're reading a book.
The book is meaningful.

1207
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,600
Where's the meaning?
Is it in your head?

1208
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,800
Is it in the book?
While it's very difficult to say,

1209
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:31,634
right,
because obviously there's a subjective 

1210
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:36,080
element to it.
There's an element that's unique to you,

1211
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,123
but just as obviously that meaning 
wouldn't manifest itself if it wasn't 

1212
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:42,854
for the book.
And of course the book wouldn't be 

1213
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:47,960
meaningful if you end the book weren't 
embedded in this complex structure.

1214
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,840
And so the meaning is an emergent 
property.

1215
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,063
The meaning is an emergent property of 
the interplay of all of the elements of 

1216
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:56,894
being.
It's a very interesting way of looking 

1217
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:02,450
at things.
So you have all these elements of PA and

1218
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,420
their dance produces meaning of one form
or another.

1219
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,553
Now you might say if you are a 
phenomenologist that some of that 

1220
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:09,614
meaning is going to be life sustaining 
and some of it is going to be life 

1221
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:13,790
destroying.

1222
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:19,070
And the phenomenologists would say from 
a clinical perspective that you're,

1223
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,690
if you're,
if you are,

1224
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:25,700
if you exist in a system of meaning,
revelations that are life destroying,

1225
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,990
that you should turn your attention away
from them towards meetings that are life

1226
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,770
affirming.
And you know,

1227
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,613
one of the things that's quite 
interesting about the phenomenological 

1228
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,690
perspective is that you can experiment 
with it quite easily.

1229
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:40,580
So I could say to you,
for example,

1230
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,790
a couple of phenomenological 
experiments,

1231
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,624
one would be for the next two weeks,
you want to detach yourself in some 

1232
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:54,110
sense so that you're a curious observer 
of your being.

1233
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,990
You're not necessarily trying to direct 
it,

1234
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,540
you know you're just trying to let it 
unfold.

1235
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:00,763
And then what you might want to watch 
for is when the meaning that manifests 

1236
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,160
itself as,
as things flow around you is clearly

1237
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,960
meaning of the life affirming tight.

1238
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,483
Now you'll see that you know,
it depends on how well situated you are 

1239
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:23,360
in some sense because if you're,
if you're surrounded by,

1240
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,920
if your experiential field is primarily 
negative,

1241
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,200
these are going to be relatively rare 
events,

1242
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:34,220
but they will still not be nonexistent.
They might only happen for a few seconds

1243
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:36,410
or a few minutes every day or every two 
days.

1244
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,760
But so say,
okay,

1245
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:38,594
you notice that all of a sudden you're 
in a place where things are the way you 

1246
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:44,300
would like them to be.
So you could say you're in a place where

1247
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:47,660
being is manifesting itself as 
acceptable.

1248
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,363
Okay,
so that's a place where nihilism is not 

1249
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:51,884
appropriate.
It doesn't apply because of the quality 

1250
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:56,780
of the experience is such that it's life
affirming.

1251
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,943
You have to notice that it's something 
that happens and then you might ask 

1252
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:02,450
yourself law,
okay,

1253
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,630
what are the preconditions that enabled 
that?

1254
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,173
What are the preconditions that enabled 
all of the different sub elements of 

1255
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:11,804
being to work harmoniously together at 
that time in place so that that was the 

1256
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:17,394
meaning that emerged.
And then the next question might be how 

1257
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:25,500
would it be possible for me to allow 
that to happen more frequently?

1258
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,810
And so you can tilt yourself towards 
life affirming meetings in a way from,

1259
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,550
from say meanings that are associated 
with despair of nihilism.

1260
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:36,384
But you do that partly,
it's almost like you're navigating in a 

1261
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:39,690
boat.
In fact,

1262
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:40,524
I think you are.
I think you're navigating to find the 

1263
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,080
line between order and chaos because 
that's where the meaning is.

1264
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,943
That's exactly where the meaning is and 
you can feel it like it's a place and 

1265
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:50,754
that's the other thing that phenomenal 
just to trying to get across these 

1266
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:54,384
things are real.
They're not secondary manifestations of 

1267
01:11:57,841 --> 01:11:59,100
some deeper reality.

1268
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,010
They are reality itself.
I also think,

1269
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:05,400
and we'll talk about this more when we 
get to the neuropsychological portion of

1270
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,790
the course,
that your brain is actually set up first

1271
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,624
and foremost to detect meaning.
You detect meaning before you detect 

1272
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,753
objects.
And it's partly because you have to 

1273
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:21,900
detect meaning so that you know what to 
do when something happens very rapidly.

1274
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:22,734
And there are times when you have to 
figure out what to do before you have 

1275
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:28,800
enough time to even see what's there.
You just don't have the time.

1276
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,110
So you know,
part of the question is,

1277
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:33,510
well what exactly do you mean by 
meaning?

1278
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:34,643
You know,
I think meaning is significance for 

1279
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:40,020
behavior or significance for the 
structure that governs behavior.

1280
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,123
But those are very,
very basic fundamental perceptions 

1281
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,000
there.
They're not.

1282
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:47,520
You see the object and then you derive 
the meaning.

1283
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,110
It's exactly the opposite.

1284
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:54,110
In many cases you perceive the meaning 
and derive the object and there's plenty

1285
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:57,060
of neurophysiological evidence for that.
For example,

1286
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:59,100
you have lots of,
you know,

1287
01:12:59,101 --> 01:12:59,934
your retina is a pattern detector and 
the retinal information is transmitted 

1288
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:06,330
to your brain alone,
the optic nerve,

1289
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,320
the optic nerve branches,
and it goes lots of places in your body.

1290
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,333
Some of it maps right onto your spinal 
cord so that your eyes can make your 

1291
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:15,174
body move.
Some of it maps onto your Amygdala so 

1292
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:18,564
that what you perceive are the meanings 
of facial expressions without even 

1293
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,104
perceiving the face.
So you can have people who have 

1294
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,960
blindsight a damaged visual Cortex,
you can show them angry faces,

1295
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:28,794
which they say they can't see,
but they'll respond to them electro 

1296
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:32,634
physiologically,
it as if they're being exposed to 

1297
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:35,574
something negative.
And it's because of the retinal pattern 

1298
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,010
is manifesting itself right onto the 
system.

1299
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:45,150
That maps one form of meaning.
So you can clearly have meaning without,

1300
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:46,403
without object perception.
And so the idea that you derive the 

1301
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:52,230
meaning from the object,
you see the thing and then you attribute

1302
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:54,990
meaning to the thing that's,
that's right.

1303
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:55,824
At some levels of analysis.
But it's wrong in many other levels of 

1304
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:00,330
analysis.
And so

1305
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,980
the other thing I think that you can try
that's phenomenologically informed.

1306
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,810
This is quite an interesting trick.
It can really,

1307
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:12,490
it's really hard on any of those.
Be careful if you try this.

1308
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,440
So what another thing you could try for 
two weeks is to watch what you say.

1309
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,180
You got to detach yourself.
Again,

1310
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,510
you have to remove the belief that your 
thoughts and you are the same thing.

1311
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,790
And then you have to watch mostly what 
you say.

1312
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,163
And then you have to see,
and this is something that Rogers would 

1313
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,430
also be an advocate of.

1314
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,473
You have to see if what you say it makes
you feel what you have to see if what 

1315
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:48,010
you say improves the quality of your 
being or makes it worse.

1316
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,353
And you know,
if you start believing in what you say 

1317
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:54,370
and watch what the consequences are 
instead,

1318
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,540
how it manifests itself in terms of a 
transformation of being,

1319
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,583
then you can also learn how to only say 
things that improve the quality of 

1320
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:04,330
being.
Well,

1321
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:05,980
that's a good thing if you can manage 
it,

1322
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:07,510
but,
but it's,

1323
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:08,344
it's,
it's terrifying in some sense because 

1324
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:10,744
one of the things that you'll find is 
that hardly anything that you say does 

1325
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,374
that most of it's neutral,
but a fair bit of it has exactly the 

1326
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:20,650
opposite consequences.
It makes things worse.

1327
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,323
So
I think I mentioned that the word 

1328
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,450
phenomenon,
that's where the phenomenology,

1329
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,323
the term phenomenology comes from.
Obviously the term phenomena means is 

1330
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:37,900
from the Greek word famous thigh and 
famous thigh means to shine forth.

1331
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,243
And so the phenomenologies 
phenomenologists argument is that like 

1332
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:44,644
being is made up of meanings that shine 
forth for you and that those different 

1333
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:50,020
meanings attract you there.
They're like,

1334
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,390
they're like guideposts that you can 
follow.

1335
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,920
So you know,
one of the,

1336
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,560
I've noticed this for example,
in relationship to reading,

1337
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:01,270
so I'll be reading a complex text and 
some passage will really strike me.

1338
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:04,600
So it manifests itself is meaningful.
Why is that?

1339
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,730
Well,
you know,

1340
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:10,060
one of the phenomenologists which would 
be being been swagger,

1341
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:10,571
we'd say,
well,

1342
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,690
it's because of the way that I'm 
structured.

1343
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,470
But boss would say,
well no,

1344
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:19,120
it's a dance that's occurring within the
structure of everything.

1345
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:19,954
And the consequence of that is the 
manifestation manifestation of this 

1346
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:23,824
meaning.
Well what I've found is that I can 

1347
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:26,734
follow threads of meaning through books.
You know that it's like it's something 

1348
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,380
that's guiding me,
that sense of meaning.

1349
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:36,220
And often if I find something within a 
book that's meaningful,

1350
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,054
then I'll read the other things that 
that person wrote and all see that some 

1351
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:41,374
of the people that they read have 
meaningful things to say and then I can 

1352
01:16:44,111 --> 01:16:48,460
branch out that network and it's,
it's following a pathway that's laid out

1353
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:51,100
for you in some sense that's laid out 
for you in the world.

1354
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,420
And you know,
the phenomenological idea is that if you

1355
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,254
follow that pathway,
then what happens is being becomes more 

1356
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:06,451
and more integrated around you and those
experiences of,

1357
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:11,960
of intrinsic meaning start to multiply 
and increase in intensity.

1358
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:12,794
And you know,
if you're able to do that over a long 

1359
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:15,854
period of time,
then you can get more and more of the 

1360
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:22,940
totality of your being,
revealing the kind of meanings that stop

1361
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:26,050
you from being either nihilistic or 
totalitarian.

1362
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,070
And so,
well,

1363
01:17:28,071 --> 01:17:28,904
that's the basic,
that's the fundamental theory of 

1364
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:32,810
phenomenological psychotherapy.

1365
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,430
You know,
we might first say,

1366
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:35,480
well,
you know,

1367
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:38,360
you're depressed and anxious and your 
life isn't going very well.

1368
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,180
What keeps you afloat?
It's an,

1369
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,850
it's something to observe.
And then we might say,

1370
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:44,684
well,
are there ways that we can expand that 

1371
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:53,681
small area that's keeping you afloat so 
that it starts to occupied more and more

1372
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:54,854
of your experience and push back the 
parts that are either neutral or 

1373
01:17:57,891 --> 01:17:59,720
negative.
And you know,

1374
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:00,554
it's,
uh,

1375
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,263
it's in large part a consequence of 
attention and willingness to first of 

1376
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:10,394
all,
treat things as if they're meaning is 

1377
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:13,280
real.
And then second,

1378
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:14,114
to allow that reality to transform the 
way that you experience things in the 

1379
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:24,011
future.
See you Thursday.
