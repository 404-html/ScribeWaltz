1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,700
Yeah,
this does my reproduction

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,073
piece
from the conceptual level between group 

3
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:31,510
identification,
whatever stage of moral

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,393
coming after it,
and the idea here is think of this 

5
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,594
initial stage is childhood.
It goes a horse presumptions of did 

6
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,970
undergo a horse disintegration 
adolescence,

7
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,750
I suppose mostly for biological reasons,
which is to say that

8
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,803
cause a physiological changes,
the environment to which someone has to 

9
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,050
adapt changes dramatically.
And adolescents,

10
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,543
the world isn't the same place,
so whoever you were as a child has to 

11
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,860
undergo mark revision in order for you 
to become an adult.

12
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,850
But the problem is that half the age of 
14 or so,

13
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,040
you're not really ready to become an 
adult,

14
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,090
so to speak,
whatever that means and the intermediary

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,290
intermediary process,
there's trying to draw

16
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,190
between that and
the notion of an apprenticeship

17
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,620
and then the final stages.

18
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,843
Another accomplished by means of another
as a consequence of more than all this 

19
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,294
information in all this information and 
hits this time would be the fact that 

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,690
that there are more than that.
There was more than one group.

21
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,140
I guess that might be the simplest way 
to describe it.

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,413
If you're a traditional Jew for example,
that's not such a problem unless you 

23
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,170
have to share a territory with 
traditional Christian,

24
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,040
in which case the fact that group 
identification,

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,400
the mere fact that then becomes a form 
of anomalous information that requires a

26
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,234
solution.
The solution can be obliterate your 

27
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,930
enemy,
which is I think,

28
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,850
denial of anomalous information because 
the problem with obliterating your enemy

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,693
is that you're making the presupposition
that all of the things that we had to 

30
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:39,291
offer you were worthless and I think 
that's probably an error of the mid size

31
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,480
everything is that just because you get 
rid of someone,

32
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,230
you tend not to get rid of the ideas 
that they represent.

33
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,280
Right.
Those ideas pop up again,

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,360
sometimes in the form of schismatic 
movements within your own culture.

35
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,830
If the culture,
if an enemy culture is being successful,

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,800
that sort of indicates that it's come up
with ideas that are good and the chances

37
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,634
are that you're not going to get rid of 
those ideas if you get rid of those 

38
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,760
people.
So it's a pretty,

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,080
it's a kind of a temporary solution.
Vast.

40
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:10,914
It might also be really 
counterproductive in the long run 

41
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,880
because the things that your enemy knows
might be things that you need to know,

42
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,183
but maybe not right now.
It's always possible to that they know 

43
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,780
some things you don't.
So I think that there's,

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,773
I mean ways,
I guess what I'm trying to say in the 

45
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,284
sense,
because I think it isn't an analogy on 

46
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,874
the sociopolitical level between the 
repression of enemies groups and the 

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,073
process of repression of anomalous 
information at the level of the 

48
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,404
individual.

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,430
So
that's a,

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,273
that's an analogy that I'll keep much 
more often than the last part of this 

51
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,070
course.
Well,

52
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,460
the question is where do you go from 
group identification?

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,980
And the answer to that seems to be what 
the next stage,

54
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,800
or at least an insulary or auxiliary 
stage,

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,993
is to know that there's a process that 
characterize as the construction of 

56
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,860
groups themselves,
which is,

57
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,470
I think if you think your group is 
valuable,

58
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:12,304
it's very difficult to make the claim 
that the process that made the group 

59
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,560
isn't more valuable.
You see you're sort of,

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,990
you're sort of trapped by that precept 
position right off,

61
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,260
right off the bat species.
If your group's valuable,

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,690
the process that created it is more 
valuable.

63
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,840
I think that's,
that's a necessarily logical conclusion.

64
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,810
No,
I told you,

65
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,110
I don't know if I told you this story 
before,

66
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:32,944
but there's was an interesting example 
of this sort of argument in the New 

67
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,503
Testament which I actually quote later 
in this [inaudible] where the Pharisees 

68
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:47,490
are attempting to trap Christ into 
staying something heretical so that they

69
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,590
can totally prisoner killed him and he 
says to one of the,

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
essentially you're the sort of person 
who would have killed the prophets who 

71
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,880
constructed the group that you 
mentioned,

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,993
which was really
maximally effective installed and also 

73
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,100
absolutely true.

74
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,043
Now contacting the way,
I don't remember which book that at the 

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,393
moment,
I kind of read that as the comment that 

76
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:17,974
more or less sealed his fate section 
essentially credible in salt uses a 

77
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,640
variant of that as well,
which I don't remember

78
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,843
it.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Stay in here,
which is your group identification.

80
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,003
You forfeit this process.
And the problem is is that the process 

81
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,560
that constructed the group is more 
valuable that the growth,

82
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,510
so if you identify with your group as an
authoritarian structure,

83
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,303
then you necessarily sever your 
connection with the process that the 

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,440
group and that constitutes a form of 
spiritual death.

85
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,550
So in terms of constructing the 
appropriate hierarchy of values,

86
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
when you realize that there's something 
wrong with the answer of group 

87
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:16,910
identification to the processes of life 
are to the questions of life,

88
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,583
the next stage is to recognize that
there is the possibility of identifying 

89
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,124
with the process.
That's what this diagram is trying to 

90
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,254
represent.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,200
I would say in primitive primitive cells
first new aren't confined.

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,113
This position is the sharman stay going 
through their own individual process of 

93
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,730
initiation.
It isn't necessarily the group foster,

94
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,130
and I was thinking about that this 
morning.

95
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,523
It's also the case that the show,
and this is interesting showman's for 

96
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,473
example,
the Siberians have a working vocabulary 

97
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,434
that's many times greater than that of 
their compatriots who aren't shauna 

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,710
because they're the repository of the 
entire world tradition of the tribe.

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,690
And which means they have the bill of 
rights because they're not,

100
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,910
they're not.
They don't.

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,273
So it is the case that the showman is 
not only someone who's an individual in 

102
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,560
the true sense of the word being outside
of the group,

103
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:22,394
although necessary part of it.
He's also the master of the group to a 

104
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,070
much greater degree than any of the 
people who were normally identified with

105
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,904
it.
Well that's a good lesson because what 

106
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,840
it says is 50 get here,
you really have to be in there,

107
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,870
which is something you pointed out last 
week that you don't get like we think,

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,313
I think we think in the west,
and this is one of the pathologies of 

109
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,850
primitive self help psychology that you 
can get from here to here.

110
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,510
This is used to be vaguely construed 
without without this.

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,680
And we have,
of course,

112
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,170
we love any of these intermediary 
stages.

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,033
That's a big mistake
because this is literally somewhere 

114
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,580
beyond this and that means it has to be 
everything decision plus something else.

115
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,023
So okay,
so you said in the class that we can 

116
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,263
pass on wisdom regenerations right.
We think we passed on through conscious 

117
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,680
of attraction or whatever,
you know,

118
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,573
through all lot of different processes.
So it seems that if it can be passed 

119
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,361
through,
through,

120
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,194
uh,
through the spoken word at three 

121
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,314
stories,
it seems like people don't necessarily 

122
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:31,240
have to go through chaos to advance to 
another identity.

123
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,040
If they,
if this stuff can be passed on,

124
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,500
we'll go with it.
Well,

125
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,440
the fact that the information is there,
it doesn't necessarily,

126
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,603
as you were pointing out,
it doesn't necessarily mean that you're 

127
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:49,731
in contact with him is traumatic.
Okay,

128
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
hang on.
I have another diagram.

129
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,340
We'll address that problem.
That's again,

130
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,763
depends on the level at which the 
anomalous or current school curves 

131
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,513
basically.
And there are more and less traumatic 

132
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,370
lemons.
I mean,

133
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,350
I tried to tell you a little bit about 
that before,

134
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,670
the notion that,
you know,

135
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,043
if you're going somewhere and one of 
your ways of getting there as blocked 

136
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
will,
that constitutes in the nautilus 

137
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,384
occurrence.
But if you're going somewhere and then 

138
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,114
the place itself disappears,
that's a completely different class of 

139
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,870
the dance and events in the first class.
While they're all listening to this.

140
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,704
And the second class are no homeless,
but obviously having to switch plans is 

141
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,530
nowhere near as traumatic as having to 
switch ideals.

142
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,023
Right?
So you might think about as a 

143
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,930
qualitative difference,
that's when you go up.

144
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,803
It's not that simple.
And we'll take a look at most a tree 

145
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,140
like the tree to cut it,
right.

146
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,710
It's very much,
it's very much like like,

147
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,650
like like the tree.
Okay,

148
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,810
so this is what we were discussing last 
week.

149
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,403
No,

150
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,893
it's obvious that people can tolerate a 
certain amount of normal information 

151
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,360
that's equally obvious.
Then there were severities of anomalies,

152
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,540
so to speak,
that people construe as intolerable.

153
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,350
And one of the things that we need to do
is to construct a conceptual model.

154
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,483
It will help us to determine how under 
what circumstances and normally is how 

155
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:20,170
to determine the relative,
our effect and intensity of an anomalous

156
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,730
occurrence,
I guess.

157
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:26,290
Because obviously some forms of normally
they're trivial in some are major and it

158
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,440
would be good to figure out under what 
circumstances they are trivial and maybe

159
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,274
what circumstances their major,
what are the things I want you to keep 

160
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,860
it in the back of your mind because,
and this is really useful even for those

161
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:38,110
of you that are interested in 
psychopathology,

162
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,480
say on a scientific level here.
Here's why.

163
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,660
You know,
if you develop a phobia,

164
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,183
the theory for the development of the 
phobia is exposure to the thing that 

165
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:48,700
caused the phobia.

166
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,160
That's right.
The most safe for you're afraid of mice.

167
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,150
So,
uh,

168
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,983
but the problem with that theory is that
the cure is exposure to has been very 

169
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:56,764
difficult in the behavioral literature 
to figure out why exposing yourself to 

170
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:02,690
the same thing that causes your problem.
Curiously,

171
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,960
when it was exposure to that thing to 
begin with,

172
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:07,930
the doors of the problem.
This is a very difficult problem.

173
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,740
But you know,
there's two types of [inaudible],

174
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,223
two basic types and one hero is where 
are you accidentally and counted them 

175
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:17,554
knowing and then you die.
And none of your myth is where you come 

176
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,174
in voluntarily and then you live.
And that's the difference between the 

177
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,304
kind of exposures that creates mythology
and the kind of exposure that creates 

178
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,574
healing.
Because if you're a behavior therapist 

179
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,164
for example,
what you do is you set up the 

180
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:33,604
circumstances so that the person you're 
trying to treat voluntarily encounters 

181
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:37,960
counters the anonymous experience.

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,470
So basically you cast them,
you're doing playing her own ritual.

183
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,733
And in the ritual you're casting the 
movie of the rule of the hero who's 

184
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,110
willing to encounter the enormous 
information voluntarily.

185
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,123
And this isn't just a trait rereading of
psychopathological literature and 

186
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:51,954
exposure.
We know we that if you take someone 

187
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,950
who's afraid of an elevator into it,
the elevator,

188
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,970
and they avoid,
because people will do that.

189
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,040
So even if you get them in the owner,
they'll not look at it if you can,

190
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,353
if you can convince them to take the 
risk of really exposing themselves to 

191
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,780
the thing that they're afraid of,
which basically means,

192
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,614
obviously means to explore it and to 
construct a new behavioral pattern as a 

193
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,180
consequences.
But then they get better.

194
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,823
If you're agoraphobic and you're afraid 
of a mall and you go to the mall and 

195
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,040
your symptoms come up and you run away,
and that makes your problems worse,

196
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,874
not better.

197
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,803
If you go to the mall and your symptoms 
come up and you stay there as a 

198
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,640
consequence of your own choice,
your symptoms,

199
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,600
I'll hit a plateau of like an intense 
plot help.

200
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,580
It'll be good.
It'll deteriorate over time.

201
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:40,090
And that cures you so well,
Mrs Mrs and Wesson for again,

202
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,570
I want to point out Freud's eat 
improvement.

203
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,130
That's a failed hero myth because need 
to put some counters.

204
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,260
He sleeps with his mother in that 
screening and assessment,

205
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,400
that's accidental and he blinds himself 
as a consequence.

206
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,440
So Friday.
And I would say that you,

207
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,413
that it's reasonable to make claim that 
Freudian psychology is a form of 

208
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,820
religion.
It's based on a failed hero myth,

209
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,123
which is as opposed to most religions 
that have lasted for the time material 

210
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,480
always based on successful here are 
immense because

211
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
successful here wasn't means that 
application,

212
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,653
if you don't follow that pattern,
and I'll say it again so it's not 

213
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,714
successful then in the end,
the eatable mint now Friday and well I 

214
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:22,414
don't know what,
I don't know what necessary conclusions 

215
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,844
you can draw from the fact that Freud 
kicked the deployment and it's a fail 

216
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,024
hero myth.

217
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,000
No,
I don't think so.

218
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,863
I don't know.
I don't think so because like Freud 

219
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,100
thought that the homeowner was the 
actual mother,

220
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,323
but that's often the case for someone 
who is severity neurotic with let's say 

221
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:44,044
the top.
Let's say that when you Reutemann 

222
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,373
started from,
from observation and reason and then 

223
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,370
using that analogy.
Yeah,

224
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,353
he didn't start with,
he didn't start with the integral mix 

225
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,120
men.
No,

226
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,963
he started playing out there on the 
implications lives and then just saw in 

227
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,420
the story,
but he still said and then saw the,

228
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,413
the mythical stories that seem to map 
onto the experiences of the patients 

229
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,410
that he saw.
But he did say,

230
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,510
me and me,
if that's the central problem of life,

231
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,260
that's the central problem.
Like,

232
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,080
and it's universal for Freud,
every culture in every culture,

233
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:17,914
that's the central problem.
Now that's been criticized on 

234
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,710
anthropological grounds,
which aren't really relevant here,

235
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,900
but I still think that it's more than 
just

236
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,323
more than just a historical fluke,
the things or manage themselves that 

237
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:31,810
way.

238
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,020
Because he also have to realize that 
when Freud and Jung Split,

239
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,850
the reason that they split,
for example,

240
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:37,684
it was on the question of whether or not
religion survey and useful function now 

241
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,044
on Friday taking a myth.
Well that was a myth of failure in a 

242
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,990
sense and said,
well that's,

243
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,140
you know,
that goes to the central problem to that

244
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:50,974
application.
So it wasn't a premarital sexual aspect 

245
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,170
of that.
Yeah,

246
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,370
it was.
But see the thing about mythologies that

247
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,204
it represent sexual union with the 
mother asked the incest motif and Freud 

248
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,360
thought of that as something literal.
He thought,

249
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,293
as Freud tended to do,
he offered a literal translation of 

250
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,220
something that was involved.
He said that's actually what it referred

251
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:14,054
to a,
he was using it as an analogy that he 

252
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,454
was taking a more concrete level,
which is always good in his approach 

253
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:26,640
would be to take the,
like you said,

254
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,310
to start with the fuel said sectionality
and mythology with symbol.

255
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,610
Freud said symbolism and mythology 
resection,

256
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,020
right.
Said that

257
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,643
symbolism and mythology was sexual and 
viewing said that sexual symbolism and 

258
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,080
mythology,
the sexualities mythology,

259
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,090
the symbol
that floyd was tackling sexual assaulted

260
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,770
not.
Well,

261
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,230
yeah.
Again though,

262
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,140
that's not precisely true because it 
was,

263
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,110
it was for Freud in the Victorian 
patients that he encountered,

264
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,390
it was,
sexuality was problematic because it was

265
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:06,224
contaminated with a no,
it wasn't problematic because of his 

266
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:09,974
sexuality.
It was problematic because it was 

267
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:13,784
unexplored territory and unexplored 
territory for the Victorian neurotics 

268
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,950
half of the primary and sexual in 
origin.

269
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,580
So he saw a sexuality as the presenting 
problem,

270
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,414
but it wasn't.
It was unexplored territory if it was 

271
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,820
any problem in the guise of sexual 
dysfunction.

272
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,893
I explored territory in the consulting 
where it comes in all sorts of forums 

273
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,390
and it might come in the form of an 
unresolved relationship with your mother

274
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,673
who is a form of God,
so to speak when you're a child and you 

275
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:39,824
can say that for the struggling neurotic
saying that this is a person who has a 

276
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,820
dependent personality disorder.

277
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,160
There is struggle with the parental 
situation is an analog of the process of

278
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,620
adaptation in the world.
So the parents,

279
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,690
when you're 25 30 your parents should no
longer be parents.

280
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,493
They should be other.
They should be other people who you've 

281
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,260
had an intense relationship with,
but who are other people?

282
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,720
Your parents should be someone else.
By that point,

283
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,063
if your parents are still your parents,
then the battle you should be playing 

284
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:13,934
out in the world,
it's still being played out for you and 

285
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:19,400
your family and Freud's neurotic 
patients were like that.

286
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,890
They never got,
they never made it.

287
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,193
They never made it of here.
He never made it to here much less to 

288
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,110
here.
You know,

289
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,100
they were still struggling with,
well,

290
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:28,934
how,
how do I deal with the childhood 

291
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:30,734
environment?

292
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,570
The thing is that,
uh,

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,833
the
adaptation to what we're talking about 

294
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:39,914
here is as it certainly seems to be 
appraised and our most fundamental 

295
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:47,540
biological systems than any,
any concept,

296
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,040
any story that you're used to talking 
about it.

297
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,940
Because on some level,
right to talking about the same thing.

298
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,973
So in that sense,
of course they were talking about the 

299
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,930
same thing they're talking about the 
most basic,

300
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,950
right?
Right.

301
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,620
That's,
that's it.

302
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,900
Good.
That's a good comment.

303
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,903
I mean that's,
that is one of the characteristics of 

304
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:09,411
stories that Freud cold calls
the fact that his story is meaningful on

305
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,960
multiple levels simultaneously.
Now that's a good,

306
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,580
that's a perfectly good introduction to 
the next diagram here.

307
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,560
Okay.
You remember though,

308
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,390
the old diagram,
you'll see the analogies here.

309
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,820
You know which one I talked?
All right.

310
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay.
So before what we had,

311
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,760
we were a bunch of arrows here,
right?

312
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,360
This being the ends and these being the 
means to get there.

313
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,393
But that's not a sufficient way of 
looking at the problem and since you 

314
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,770
already have mastered that way of 
looking at it,

315
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,613
so we'll introduce more difficult level 
and that level is that all the ways of 

316
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:59,160
getting to an Anne are also structures 
that are like the whole structure,

317
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,850
which is to say that when you're doing 
anything,

318
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,743
when you engaged in any activity,
you're engaged in a whole nested 

319
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,274
hierarchy of goal directed behavior and 
the NASA thing goes all the way down to 

320
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:17,241
the lowest level of analysis and all the
way up to so a kind of Maine,

321
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,203
how do you construe this while you're 
sitting in this class and you have a 

322
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,610
certain year and trying to attain 
certain goals in,

323
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,773
in just this lecture and this lectures 
nasty in this class and this class is 

324
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:29,424
nested in your educational curriculum 
and your educational curriculum is 

325
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:33,834
nested in your,
in your career goals and your career 

326
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,800
goals of nested in your culture and your
culture is to then,

327
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,000
well then it gets a little bit more 
difficult.

328
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,750
What's your culture has to,
well,

329
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,720
I would say it's nested in religious 
presuppositions.

330
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,220
What do they nested parts,
an estimate,

331
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,710
philosophical presuppositions.
Then in religious presuppositions,

332
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,050
then in behavioral place up positions 
and so on.

333
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,950
Knows how far and also down how far and 
even within the domain of the class,

334
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,743
the single lecture while you're doing 
anything in particular that's a subgoal 

335
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,283
tenacity inside of the class like you're
taking notes because this point has 

336
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,680
relevance at different levels of 
analysis.

337
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,143
There's all sorts of procedures that you
undertaking as the class continues 

338
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,490
anyways.
Now there's different ways of thinking.

339
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,353
This is vague by the way.
This is going to be a vague lecture 

340
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,630
because some of the things that I'm 
talking about,

341
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,464
you talking with you about today,
I'm trying to figure out because there 

342
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,420
was some errors in my original 
presuppositions.

343
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,303
I'm trying to clear them up so if you 
have any comments that you think are 

344
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,814
particularly insightful,
I'd be more than happy to hear them say 

345
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,033
you can think of this as a corporate 
structure to the whole corporations 

346
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,723
going off to do something and these 
would be vice presidents sort of 

347
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,800
equivalent status and then each vice 
president would occupy a domain.

348
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,740
He has underlings and they have their 
particular story to,

349
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,983
to act out in the domain of the 
corporation and they govern some other 

350
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:05,644
people and so on and so forth,
all the way down to the bottom level of 

351
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,520
analysis.
And even a thing like the corporation.

352
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,560
If you think of this as a corporation or
any other,

353
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,590
any other structure for that matter.
Again,

354
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,190
corporations are nested inside of 
political structure that's nested inside

355
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:22,180
it philosophical structure.
That's why people pay.

356
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,390
Businessmen are generally advocates,
at least at least explicitly of the free

357
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,524
market because their whole story only 
maintains its validity within the 

358
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,430
context of a whole network of 
philosophical presuppositions.

359
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,923
Right?
So,

360
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,350
and that's the case at every single 
level of analysis.

361
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,050
You know,
I guess part of what we're interested in

362
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,180
is like what's at the highest level of 
analysis,

363
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,950
what's out there at the edge.

364
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,503
I just wanted to ask you if you would 
point out where you making corrections 

365
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,830
as we go along.
If one,

366
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,963
when you said you were going to make,
you said this would be a little vague 

367
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,394
because there's some mechanism 
corrections and measured and there's 

368
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,501
only,
yeah.

369
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,334
Well,
this is slightly different than what 

370
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,960
we're basically did it with chapter four
here.

371
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,050
The idea is not necessarily different,
but diagrams.

372
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,793
No,
it's still [inaudible] I'm still in the 

373
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:15,730
same ballpark.
I'm just trying to,

374
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,100
this is still the same.
If there was any

375
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,730
breast
story,

376
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,500
behavioral story are at odds and then 
you're neurotic.

377
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,173
No,
I mean that,

378
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,931
I mean,
yes,

379
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:41,764
it has to be hierarchical and all this 
has to be subjugated to ask the 

380
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,870
question,
what does it have to be subjugated to?

381
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,760
That's why I put this,
this diagram up.

382
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,763
Well look,
there's going to be lots of situations 

383
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:58,774
where you can have a story,
a story B and they're going along in 

384
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,800
parallel and there's no problem 
whatsoever.

385
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,170
Just like there are lots of cases where 
culture,

386
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:07,900
Asian culture be occupied in the same 
territory more or less,

387
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,730
no problem.
But then now and then a historical event

388
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,453
and that event points out those areas 
where those two parallel stories 

389
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,700
actually conflict.
So look,

390
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,900
for a most of us,
most of us Westerners so to speak,

391
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:29,560
are the educated population.
There is a conflict for us,

392
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,483
I think between how we act and our moral
presuppositions and how we conceive of 

393
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,130
the universe.
From the scientific perspective,

394
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,170
it's a big conflict.
Well,

395
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,090
most of the time it doesn't make any 
difference,

396
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,550
but now and then it makes a big 
difference.

397
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,670
And in the,
when we only,

398
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,513
when you say that someone's 
psychologically integrated or when you 

399
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:49,634
say someone,
when you see someone who has an 

400
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,020
impeccable character,
that might mean I'm looking at it.

401
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,183
What you see is the fact that all their 
stories take one story because they're 

402
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:58,844
not working at cross purposes.
So you can be offering different 

403
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,004
stories.

404
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
Well,
superstructure,

405
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,260
if you're an integrated,
you have a superstructure

406
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,833
that I think is relatively explicit to 
which all your other brands are made 

407
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,270
subject,
which is the credit.

408
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,530
And then the question is what 
constitutes the king?

409
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,620
You could look at this at Lawrence of 
different levels of analysis.

410
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,191
Okay.
You say,

411
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,024
well,
all your different motivational 

412
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,830
subsystems have to operate in harmony,
right?

413
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,530
So each of them has to take all of the 
others into account.

414
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,600
The vice presidents.
Well,

415
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,160
that might be one way of looking at it.
Sure.

416
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:34,994
I mean there's,
I was thinking more in intro psyche and 

417
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,320
speaking.
You have to eat,

418
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,130
you have to sleep,
you need social contact,

419
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,270
et Cetera,
et cetera.

420
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,700
There's all these basic preconditions 
for your existence that have to be mad,

421
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,453
all of those,
and you have specialized biological 

422
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,304
subsystems that are responsible for 
ensuring that one of those particular 

423
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,830
needs is math and the way those systems 
ensure that is by,

424
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,310
I think by gripping your fantasy when 
something within you is out of kilter.

425
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,020
So for example,
if you're in this class,

426
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:09,854
you have need for five hours while I'm 
talking intrusive thoughts about what 

427
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:14,984
you might need afterwards are going to 
pop into the theater of your mind 

428
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,130
because that's the subsystem that's 
responsible for maintaining your caloric

429
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:27,131
intake is not being satisfied by your 
current state of goal directed activity.

430
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,963
Your job to adapt is to organize all 
those motivational subsystems into a 

431
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:39,401
unit such that none of them conflict and
so that all of the more towards the same

432
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:44,060
man so that all of them get what they 
need.

433
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,613
Well.
Also paying attention to the fact that 

434
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,780
every other one gets what it means.
Now,

435
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:54,200
the same thing exactly can be said about
your relationships with other people,

436
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,300
because you could say just as you have 
to take all of your needs into account,

437
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,183
you're operating in a social environment
and to take all your needs into account 

438
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,533
also means to take into account the 
needs of everyone that you come into 

439
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:08,174
contact with.

440
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,400
So it's also the,
it's,

441
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,520
it is the case.
Even that when you're trying to modulate

442
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,354
the environment so that you get what you
have to get a lot of the environment 

443
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:17,924
that you're modulating his other people.
So there's a nice amorphism between the 

444
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:22,784
way you construct your internal 
hierarchy and the way that the social 

445
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,540
hierarchy round,
he was constructed,

446
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,740
unnecessary isomorphism networks all the
way up.

447
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,750
Now,
the Mesopotamians,

448
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,660
they asked,
they asked the question,

449
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,230
who should be king?
And on the mythical level,

450
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,240
that means who should determine 
destinies.

451
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,350
And what that means is how it should 
behave.

452
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,920
They're operating under what ages and 
the Enuma Elish,

453
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:47,754
which is their creation story,
says all gods should be subordinate to 

454
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,110
Martech.
Martech,

455
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,740
the garden goes up to the unknown,
creates the world,

456
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,040
and that's what this diagram is about,
right?

457
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,760
That's your group identification.
So that's a provision,

458
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:04,920
lance to the problem with that 
adaptation question is though,

459
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,880
what should everything be subordinate to
including your group?

460
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,713
I think medication,
which is your particular solution to 

461
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,114
your motivation problems on that's 
everything should be subordinate to the 

462
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:16,104
process that generates new inflammation 
out of the encounter with them and 

463
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:23,460
updates known territory.
That's okay.

464
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:26,280
So then to,
to get right back to your question,

465
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,760
all your stories should be arranged in a
hierarchy such that the highest story,

466
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,713
his allegiance with the process that 
engages in creative contact with the 

467
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,070
unknown and to the degree that that's 
not the case,

468
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,990
then you've deviated from the path.
So for example,

469
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,360
there's another new testaments during 
their crisis,

470
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,900
it's more theirs.
He's driving on a cart with the rich man

471
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,423
and rich man says,
what do I have to do to get into heaven 

472
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,750
and crisis?
We have to sell everything you own.

473
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,110
And all the disciples that are just 
flabbergasted by this,

474
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:01,950
you know,
they don't like this.

475
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,783
I said,
well,

476
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,130
if that's the case,
there's no hope.

477
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,530
No one's going to do that.
And then of course,

478
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:08,364
as well as easier for account and go 
through the avenue in which men and 

479
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:14,340
they're having now the reason for that,
it has nothing to do with money.

480
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,213
It has nothing to do with money.
It has to do with the relative 

481
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,800
importance of goals.
He says,

482
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,100
if,
because this young guy is so preoccupied

483
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,490
with this wealth and maintaining it,
which is this,

484
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,863
but he won't risk this to do this,
and so all that that story is pointing 

485
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:38,610
out is that if you want this and you 
won't risk this to do this,

486
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,900
then you don't get this,
which is what you really want.

487
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,320
Even though you don't know it's your 
money is just a proxy for that.

488
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,700
It's false security.

489
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,720
There's a copy machine right outside the
door for one second.

490
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,280
Okay.
I think we could write notes on it.

491
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,540
Would you consider that?

492
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,540
Yes,
absolutely.

493
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,160
Absolutely.
Look,

494
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,900
one of the things that need cheap ass,
late 18 hundreds was our,

495
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:17,950
their neurosis of health.
And by that he meant can you be properly

496
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:20,680
adopted to pathological circumstance of 
[inaudible]?

497
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,543
Yes.
It's like when you say crime of 

498
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,484
obedience,
what you say is adherence to this and 

499
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:28,574
the sacrifice of this.
That's why most people are a little bit 

500
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:32,200
before.
Well,

501
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:34,060
it's also looked like it was like,
you know,

502
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,630
one of the things that the 20th century 
is having struggle with is the notion of

503
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:38,464
crimes against humanity.
It's right because the Nazi would say 

504
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,720
and and accurately would say,
look,

505
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,580
I'm a trivial individual.
I'm just doing my job.

506
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,240
I was following orders that move down 
the hierarchy.

507
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,960
It wasn't my responsibility.
No.

508
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,190
Normally,
not only was it not my responsibility,

509
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,050
but I wasn't doing what I should have 
done.

510
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,161
And you can say,
well,

511
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,350
those people were just rationalizing 
their behavior.

512
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,423
But the point is,
is that they're making a valid 

513
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:07,270
statement.
But the Nuremberg trial says,

514
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:10,660
look,
for reasons we don't understand,

515
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:13,570
which is to say for for reasons we can't
make explicit,

516
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,200
there are certain rules you can break 
even if you're,

517
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,770
even if you're morally operate from this
perspective,

518
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,230
which is to say there's certain rbc you 
can't fall.

519
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,060
I think that's tough,
isn't it?

520
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,894
Because if you're a soldier in the war 
time and your commander say three or 

521
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,940
four levels of hierarchy up says,
you know,

522
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,790
shoot these villagers and you don't 
shoot them,

523
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,170
your dad.
But the number of Charles says,

524
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,990
tough luck.
Basically there are,

525
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,950
um,
there are certain orders you can't fall.

526
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,300
And then the question is,
well,

527
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,430
what does that mean?
There are certain orders you can fall.

528
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,593
Well,
it means that there's something outside 

529
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:54,964
of what you can define explicitly or 
what your culture is defined explicitly 

530
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,020
or it doesn't mean anything.
I would say,

531
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,120
well,
the crime against humanity,

532
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,313
this is the definition.
You do what this says instead of what 

533
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,680
this says.
And that's the definition.

534
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,750
Perhaps it just means that to,
you

535
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,293
realize,

536
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,000
okay,
in the in the tire,

537
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,260
which would be the person who gave you 
the order?

538
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,193
Yeah.
In the first one it tells you that you 

539
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,360
shouldn't well enough.
They don't know why.

540
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,350
Fair enough.
Although I like I,

541
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,293
I think that,
I do think that the Nuremberg trials 

542
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,514
were,
I don't think that it's reasonable to 

543
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:41,980
construe them as,
as the response of one tire need to,

544
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,940
the excesses of enough.
I don't think so.

545
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,140
I think there's more to it than that.
Even though you know,

546
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,610
for the person who's caught in the 
middle,

547
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,910
I mean they're in trouble or it looks 
the same.

548
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,390
That's true.

549
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,160
That's true.
How do you go?

550
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,683
Well that's the whole last half of the 
course just because that's what I'm 

551
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:05,420
interested in is like,
because of these isoboards isms exist.

552
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,170
But I mean,
the simple answer to that is that your,

553
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,603
your personal response to anomalous 
information in a way that's not trivial 

554
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:17,680
determines the course of your culture in
a way that like,

555
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,553
which seems complete.
That seems like a completely ridiculous 

556
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,400
statement,

557
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,800
but
I still think it's true.

558
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,083
So

559
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,563
culture that's made up of people who 
take the character logically negative 

560
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,100
stairs towards it,
homeless information back.

561
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:33,934
So that's a fascist state.
That's why well thing about a fascist 

562
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,770
state and Scott,
just the structure,

563
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,203
it's a,
you have to remember that our current 

564
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:46,730
states,
our bodies of law,

565
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,863
which means they're,
they're explicit descriptions of 

566
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:55,050
behavioral patterns that when put into 
operation are actually embodied.

567
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,300
It's right there rules about how to act,
which is to say what a state is,

568
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:02,120
is this is a description of an ideal 
personality.

569
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,420
All the laws in this state constitute 
the description of an ideal personality.

570
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:09,740
Because what the law says is at least 
you can't do this.

571
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,800
So in this it defining is what you 
should be by exclusion,

572
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,630
right?
And all those things that you can do,

573
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:16,464
well that makes up the ideal citizen and
everyone who's the member of the same 

574
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:23,060
culture is a duplicate of that ideal 
citizen.

575
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,330
So then the question again is what's the
ideal citizen?

576
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,570
And someone who's bureaucratically and 
client will say,

577
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,404
well,
the ideal citizen does exactly what the 

578
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,360
hell you tell him to do.
And that makes everyone predictable.

579
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,340
But then there's this leap above that 
morality which says,

580
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,020
well,
no,

581
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,950
the ideal citizen knows what to do and 
what not to do according to the rules.

582
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,310
But when the circumstances change
or when the circumstances call for it,

583
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,803
then there's another morality that 
supersedes the group identity on upon 

584
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:01,160
which group structure is necessarily 
maintain.

585
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,113
That's the thing that's so interesting 
has been the harder you try to ensure 

586
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:05,954
that these boundaries are impermeable,
the more likely you are to kill 

587
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:10,010
everything that's inside here.

588
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,663
Just
social around the identity was the 

589
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:21,940
hardest question for anyone who is,
what should I do?

590
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,740
That's what so is it through the goal?

591
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,381
Well,
yes.

592
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:26,240
That's sure.
Sure.

593
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,833
Look,
we do not want to ever make the mistake 

594
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:34,350
of presuming that there are tremendous 
advantages to staying inside here.

595
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,390
I mean it's,
there's no anomaly.

596
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,290
What?
What's the problem?

597
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,760
Well,
there's no interest.

598
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,060
I mean because if you are by definition,
if you exclude novelty,

599
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,193
you exclude incentive reward.
So what happens is that you get 

600
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,390
protection at the cost of,
of all the interest in life.

601
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,970
Now what this alternative route says,
well,

602
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:56,820
if you do,
if you face the anomalous information,

603
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,820
there's enough interest generating 
there,

604
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,663
which is enough hope so to speak,
that that in itself will provide a 

605
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:06,360
barrier against all of the negative 
potentialities.

606
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:08,250
They don't occur as a consequence of 
doing this,

607
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,640
which is to say if you're willing to 
take the leap outside,

608
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,403
there are phenomena that you will 
encounter there that will protect you 

609
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,550
from all the negative things that you've
encountered.

610
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,890
So here,
everything is predictable but sterile.

611
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,400
That's why mythology and it kingdom 
ruled by a tire and everything dries up,

612
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,460
right?
The river's disappeared,

613
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,930
the trees died,
the grass dies.

614
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,103
Everything's dad and everything's old.
But as you just pointed out with the 

615
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:33,450
Nuremberg trials,
that's not necessarily true.

616
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,313
You jump outside,
you're quite likely to end up dead 

617
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,200
depending on what,
how,

618
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,034
on how strong the of the people who are 
trying to learn bird didn't jump 

619
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,760
outside.
No,

620
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:42,594
but I mean you,
I was referring back to the elephant is 

621
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,050
the fascist state.
You were discussing the person,

622
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,930
if someone four or five levels up orders
you to kill these villagers.

623
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:53,220
Yes.
If you don't do it,

624
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,390
you're dead.
I mean,

625
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:55,224
and that's joe and that's jumping out.
So I have to read the second volume of 

626
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:58,494
the Gulag archipelago because that 
answers that question and there's no 

627
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:02,940
simple answer to it.

628
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,630
So because let's say if you want to 
start the book,

629
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,464
there's a chapter at the end which you 
protein in the personality texted last 

630
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,943
year called the soul and barb wire.
And this is exactly the issue that 

631
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,263
Solzhenitsyn discusses that says when 
the price for stepping outside of his 

632
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,594
death,
then what?

633
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,230
Wow.
Read the book because it's the only,

634
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:23,064
it's the only book.
I know that there have been other books 

635
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:28,790
written like that.
I mean he really address either,

636
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:29,803
I mean,
either you die or you or you stay in 

637
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,670
well,
well,

638
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:40,380
well is not,
not necessarily because the thing is the

639
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,680
threats for stepping outside their real,
it's like this,

640
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,280
this chaos might've been death.
I mean this is a real thing.

641
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,310
You know,
it's not just the,

642
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,300
it's not just a circle.
That's right.

643
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,440
It's fun just to see a glow in the mall 
might kill.

644
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,903
I mean,
people get depressed and then they 

645
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,510
should themselves,
you know,

646
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,670
it's like this is really dangerous and 
one of the things that might have to use

647
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:03,504
might get killed.
That's why in one of the standard 

648
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:09,990
features of a hero mythology is the 
negative encounter with the group,

649
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,030
right?
Quality in the New Testament story of,

650
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,680
for example,
Christ is exposed to this appears all,

651
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,920
all who've said,
kill him.

652
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,070
And so that's the price for stepping 
outside,

653
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,210
even though theoretically he's,
he's the embodiment of the process.

654
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:29,100
That revitalizes group last week you 
talked a little bit about the MTA,

655
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,091
right?
Right.

656
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,740
Well,
that's what this is trying to represent.

657
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,110
What's the motivation for fronting that 
much?

658
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,550
What is it
that motivates someone to step two?

659
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,970
Well,
I would say,

660
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:53,340
again,
it's anomalous information here full.

661
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,360
I see it's full of this,
but why don't characterize it

662
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,700
motivates a movement.
Yeah.

663
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,390
Well,
you know,

664
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,223
the simple answer to that was faith.
One of the things that human said that 

665
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,163
was useful,
the voter religious tradition and the 

666
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,070
use of religious traditions and 
psychotherapy,

667
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:14,904
isn't it?
If prior to the dawn of empirical 

668
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:19,970
medicine,
um,

669
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,333
uh,
cultural,

670
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,760
uh,
medical personality,

671
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,594
if you were suffering from a particular 
disease would tell you a story about a 

672
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:35,001
god who had the same problem and your 
mythical participation in the adventures

673
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,810
of that God would constitute and 
curative ritual.

674
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,810
Some of these rituals are very,
very elaborate.

675
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,273
Now you could say that the purpose of a 
religion in the sense is to provide you 

676
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:50,344
with a body of images that describes how
this process works and then points out 

677
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:57,064
in the sense that there's a light at the
end of the tunnel and it's like 

678
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,903
identification with that image can sort 
of provide a barrier against all the 

679
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,970
chaos that's outside of the group.

680
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,430
So that's what I identification with the
central figure of a given religion.

681
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,700
That's what that's supposed to do.
So it's,

682
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,090
it's almost,
look,

683
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,890
here's an example,
vampire movie vampires hate crosses,

684
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:21,724
right?
There are a vampire is a symbol of the 

685
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:24,604
unknown.
There's some sexual contamination there 

686
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,960
as a general rule too,
but it's a night creature.

687
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,310
The Sun destroys it and you can be 
protected against it by the cross is one

688
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,940
of the things that works in horror 
stories.

689
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,013
And I frequent the occurrences.
This backfires after a priest and he 

690
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,794
holds up across in,
it's glowing when he's out of there and 

691
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:48,940
then the priest gets afraid and the glow
goes away and the vampire eats them.

692
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,890
It doesn't exactly the same notion.
Takes his bloody way.

693
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,890
Well it's ident well anyways,
that was the best answer.

694
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,780
That question I think.
Okay.

695
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:02,920
So the first thing I want to say is 
that,

696
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,293
so you,
you call the second level up their 

697
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,020
identity identification with the group,
right?

698
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,080
It's adolescence because that's out of 
the license.

699
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:14,080
Now you said that even when you do,
when you try to be an individual,

700
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,890
you still part of a group of people who 
think that they're individuals.

701
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,083
So I would say it would be possible to,
to think of that the top oval as 

702
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,710
identification with a group who's,
who's,

703
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,840
uh,
main motivation is the process.

704
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,250
Yeah.
I think that's still possible.

705
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:35,440
And the second thing I want to say is,
um,

706
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,233
what is it?
That's a perfectly reasonable way of 

707
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:41,530
looking at it.
Although it's a group composed of people

708
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:44,710
whose job is to revive my screws.
So it's not a group,

709
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,210
it's not a group.
It's a medic group.

710
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,600
[inaudible] group.
No,

711
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,493
no.
This is an important point because one 

712
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,214
of the things that I brought up 
yesterday or last week was there's two 

713
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,110
types of primary philosophical question 
in a Samsung scope relative.

714
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,120
First question is,
what is the good,

715
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,960
and that's a question,
but then there's a medic question,

716
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,080
which is what is the nature of the 
process?

717
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,840
The provides answers to the question,
what is the good?

718
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:16,470
Now a group answers the question.
So what is the good being an arts?

719
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,540
What is the nature of the process that 
allows you to answer the question?

720
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,680
What is the good,
well,

721
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,514
that's identification with them.
That group and [inaudible] group is the 

722
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,280
group of all individuals whose job is to
revitalize the group.

723
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,110
So I think that is possible to fit in 
that that,

724
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,310
okay,
fine,

725
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,143
fair enough.
The second thing I'm going to say is 

726
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:41,030
that I don't think that it's possible 
for everyone to attain that level.

727
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,940
Although I'd like to.
I don't,

728
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,630
what do you mean not possible?
I think that some people,

729
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,850
uh,
temperament wise or not.

730
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,450
So you say that the top level,
uh,

731
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,093
um,
no,

732
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,000
the monsters you encounter.
Exactly.

733
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:56,970
You're so right.
Right,

734
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,291
right,
right,

735
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,124
right,
right,

736
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,811
right.
Okay.

737
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:00,471
Right.
So,

738
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,304
but you've said that Shamans,
you said Shamans are people in that 

739
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,240
upper oval,
right?

740
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,051
I would say.
Okay.

741
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:06,884
So now the,
the Mayans and Aztecs do believe that 

742
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,560
not everyone can be a showman.
That's true.

743
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,210
That only certain people with certain,
uh,

744
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,630
unconscious,
uh,

745
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,903
you know,
it's just of unconscious strength could 

746
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,450
be one.
And so I think that it's,

747
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,570
you know,
some people just have a,

748
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,860
okay,
again,

749
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:28,160
I want to go talking and say,
well,

750
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,830
that's a perfectly reasonable objection 
in a sense,

751
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,520
but it's also the case that heroism in 
the sense,

752
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:35,270
so curves and different levels of 
[inaudible].

753
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,260
Right.
So let's,

754
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,120
I want to show you another dining room.

755
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,300
Well,
we asked,

756
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,563
okay.

757
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,101
Oh,
well here,

758
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:58,140
let's do a simpler one first.
So there was this side here,

759
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,983
right?
That's how your plans are actually 

760
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:03,220
organized and under some circumstances,
you know,

761
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,480
planning your plan B and they're both 
more or less what this is as good as the

762
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:09,190
other.
That doesn't really work.

763
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,083
But it's a reasonable way of,
because almost always you do plan a 

764
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,090
because it's better than plan b.
At least they think of it.

765
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:16,924
So we didn't,
it occupies a position that's higher up 

766
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:21,570
in the hierarchy and you'll shift down 
to plan B if you have to.

767
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,283
So that's where I've said,
well you have two alternative plans and 

768
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,650
this would be the representation where,
well,

769
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:30,484
no,
you just,

770
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,383
it's only one plan.
This and ask is ultimately you can only 

771
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,280
do one thing at a time.
That's the problem.

772
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,810
That's the problem.
That's right.

773
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:40,270
That's why,
that's actually why we have interests.

774
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,270
Like in conflict,
I think we have one output apparatus and

775
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,480
a dozen input around says and only one 
gets control at a time.

776
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,320
So that's the nature of quotes.
Like this is when a motivational system,

777
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,470
they say run like hell and motivation be
just to be,

778
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,131
to say,
well,

779
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:03,400
let's get something to eat and 
motivational system C is saying,

780
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:05,110
well,
we should actually go visit our friends,

781
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,960
so that's conflict and there's all to 
get all this record.

782
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,220
It's one on foot.
That's right.

783
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:12,610
That's an effective just regulation and 
went up with a service.

784
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,490
That's true.
That's true.

785
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,980
That's what we're hoping for.
One output that serious,

786
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,860
all goals fall.
All of those are valid.

787
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,443
That's what we're looking for.
What behavioral pattern best satisfies 

788
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,263
all conceivable motivational goals in a 
social context composed of individuals 

789
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:33,654
who are doing exactly the same thing,
but that'll have to be completed over 

790
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:36,420
time.

791
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,150
There's more,
there's more to it that works over time.

792
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,680
It's stable enough to maintain itself 
and flexible enough to readjust.

793
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,070
That's the criteria for the southern 
shit that's missed it in.

794
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,253
Yes,
temp temporality makes a big difference 

795
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,670
because what works.
That's why authority.

796
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:54,643
Another traction for authoritarian 
societies is they work but not for very 

797
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:00,810
long.
They're not very good at,

798
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,120
don't have very good at power 
transitions.

799
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,013
When the king dies,
all of the people that he squashed or 

800
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,960
just squashed paypal does not make very 
good kings,

801
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,330
sort of makes the authoritarian state 
the client.

802
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,580
So,
okay,

803
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,414
now
let's look at how you actually maybe 

804
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,650
choose between different alternatives.
Now this is,

805
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,280
this kind of touches on some of the 
things we discussed yesterday.

806
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,290
If you know,
this is a,

807
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,380
this is an interesting question.
You fail a test and uh,

808
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,573
well that blows your course goal.
Let's say your core school was getting 

809
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,530
any,
now you're going to get a seat and maybe

810
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,364
it has some trends,
even effects on your educational 

811
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:51,531
attainment,
some even more trans effects on career.

812
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,280
Okay.
The Valence of the normals,

813
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,183
inflammation,
which is the b minus shifts with your 

814
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,230
framework of reference,
right?

815
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,500
With regards to this course,
it's a catastrophe.

816
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,470
With regards to my education,
it's an inconvenience with regards to my

817
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,304
career.

818
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,283
Wow.

819
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,430
It's tricky with regards to my life.
It's a nonentity,

820
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,360
right?
So you can switch the valence of,

821
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,420
uh,
an anomalous,

822
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,483
the valence on the anomalous piece of 
information shift with frame of 

823
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,900
reference.
That's a useful thing to know.

824
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,270
Okay.
So here's the idea.

825
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,233
If you're trying to get from here to 
here and you have a plan but it doesn't 

826
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:34,320
work,
right?

827
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,860
So within that larger frame of 
reference,

828
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,030
you undergo a small descends into chaos 
and you can come up with another plan.

829
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,253
But the chaos here,
this deals with some of the issues you 

830
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,830
talked about.
If you me at one time too about the idea

831
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:52,890
that the chaos that was outside was also
inside.

832
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,200
Well that's how it works as far as I can
tell,

833
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,530
is that
the effect of valence of this particular

834
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,930
anomalous piece of information is 
bounded by a larger story.

835
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,723
Okay?
So the thing is is it's a drag that you 

836
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:10,350
get a b minus from the perspective of 
the course.

837
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,030
But if you pop by the valence of that 
anomaly is bounded by the fact that it's

838
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:15,864
really not going to hurt your education 
goals that much and then it's not going 

839
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:21,710
to affect your career at all.
So you have,

840
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,643
there's a domain,
there's a domain in which the anomalous 

841
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,084
inflammation is actually valid and 
there's a whole bunch of domains where 

842
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:30,334
it isn't.

843
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,160
Now,
the problem is sometimes you encountered

844
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:33,994
anomalous piece of information
who's Valence is unbounded and blows 

845
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,434
apart whole structures of stories.
So let's say this is a bit of a 

846
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:48,730
different circumstance.
You're hovering on the edge of it except

847
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:49,930
for filigree.
For medical school,

848
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,720
it's like one more b minus your over 
there.

849
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,790
So
you have a professor that everybody gets

850
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,710
along with except you can you get a d 
minus for,

851
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,663
you know,
this is the end of medical school plus 

852
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,090
there's this other residual mystery 
leashes.

853
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,910
Why does everybody except you get along 
with this person.

854
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,670
Maybe this is also something you've 
noticed it on the classes.

855
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,730
It's like this particular piece of 
anomalous information.

856
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,700
The domain is very unbounded,
right?

857
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,210
It blows the chorus.
It blows the educational table.

858
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,060
We'll say all you are going to 
university for us to be a doctor.

859
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,970
That's it.

860
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,430
It's like the rest of it.
It was a means to an end and that's it.

861
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,280
You're not interested in biology.
Have no alternate.

862
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,833
That's right.
You don't have any other legs to stand 

863
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:33,731
on.
That's right.

864
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:35,560
You've sacrificed your own interest 
even,

865
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,293
which is a dangerous thing to do in 
pursuit of this bound donated stability 

866
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,973
that's gone well.
Then you have a piece of anomalous 

867
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:45,094
information that's here.
It just below his whole sequences of 

868
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:52,330
stories and you're depressed.
So the larger the area

869
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,950
inside each of these,
sorry,

870
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:56,943
these are the turtles all the way down 
in the Roseville firmness and the 

871
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,230
turtles go all the way down
anyways.

872
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:05,703
Anyways,
the broader the domain that the 

873
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,840
anomalous information destroys,
the more of your life falls into pieces.

874
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,220
So that's why.
Well,

875
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,820
you can think of in terms of group 
behavior,

876
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,690
to the degree that you and I share a 
goal,

877
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,930
a threat to that story will unite us as 
a group.

878
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,160
So let's say the Republicans hate 
universities.

879
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,060
We both like universities.
Well,

880
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:28,894
therefore us,
for the purposes of that particular 

881
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,760
event,
we constitute group.

882
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,560
But if the Republicans hate,
no,

883
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:37,210
let's say we go in the university 
administration,

884
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,373
the Dean hates science,
but really likes the humanities and 

885
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,610
you're in the humanities and the 
sciences.

886
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,033
Well,
we're two different groups all of a 

887
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,570
sudden.
That's right.

888
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,270
The anomalous information has a 
different valence for us.

889
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,393
Our goals determined,
which are because we've identified with 

890
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,160
a group or goals are going to determine 
the information.

891
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,480
Also from cards,
the kids in group.

892
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:01,963
This is easier to understand
that there's all kinds of information 

893
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:14,410
that complained you into despair that 
don't seem to be directly related to any

894
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,244
plan of action.

895
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,080
Okay.
Next Diagram.

896
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,280
No,
this is how this is really good.

897
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:22,440
I just,
because there isn't any accident.

898
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:23,640
It's not a golden record.
That's right.

899
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,260
That's the,
that's the brief answer to that.

900
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,040
Look what this story does.
What

901
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,873
a story does literally is provide all 
the events that you encounter with 

902
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,570
determinants significance and they're 
all construed.

903
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:36,404
The significance of any event is 
construed with regards to its to its 

904
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,230
perceived relationship to a goal.
Okay.

905
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,363
Say that it's the loss of your mother.
That doesn't seem to affect any story 

906
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,040
that you can say you put your finger on.
Okay.

907
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,900
Well then the question is,
look,

908
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,810
this is tough.
This is a really tough issue.

909
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,673
I'm glad you brought it up because a lot
of the stories that we participate in 

910
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,170
aren't explicit.
We can't state what they are.

911
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,110
You know,
for example,

912
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,830
I may indication you,
you can think about it.

913
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,664
If you think this is accurate,
you take something like the American 

914
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,230
constitution.
Okay.

915
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:13,870
That's an explicit body of rules that 
defines a state so that's a bounded,

916
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,880
don't make mistake but it's predicated 
the first of that chapter he pointed out

917
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:20,734
in a Thomas Kuhn,
no current go down and sending them any 

918
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,420
assistance internally.

919
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,253
Coherent and complete isn't necessarily 
is predicated on preset positions that 

920
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:31,550
can be proved for wind from within the 
system.

921
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,590
Okay.
He's talking about this.

922
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,380
I think this infinite regressive systems
say,

923
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,223
well you can look at,
you play the geometries example except 

924
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:44,750
the first five axioms.
Then you're in the story in a way you go

925
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,030
but you have to accept those axioms on 
faith and I would say,

926
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:47,864
well those axioms are actually nasty in 
another story and that story in term is 

927
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:54,410
nested in another story in and so on and
so forth.

928
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,710
As far as you want to look.
The American constitution for example,

929
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,920
is predicated on these on natural 
rights.

930
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,760
That's how I read it anyways,
is that,

931
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,290
which is an national rights are a brief 
description,

932
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,124
some exquisite,
some implicit of what it means to be 

933
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:12,080
human or what being human means.
It means lots of things.

934
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,293
It means that you're equal before God.
That would be the most fundamental 

935
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:16,514
presupposition and that's a weird 
question that deals with your request 

936
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:22,874
and to some degree about the capability 
of everybody to get to that highest 

937
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,354
level of achievement.
While the constitution is predicated on 

938
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,130
the notion that everyone has that 
capacity,

939
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,510
everyone universally equally,
but everyone has the capacity to follow.

940
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:36,344
They go back,
but not necessarily to go to a certain 

941
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,654
level.
That's true.

942
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,980
The level of the activity is individual 
specific.

943
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,610
That's why you have individual 
interests.

944
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:46,250
That's right.
That's what makes you individuals,

945
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,790
those things that appeal to you and your
domain of competence is unique,

946
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,680
but still the capacity to engage in this
process at some level,

947
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,693
we don't care what the problem is as 
long as you're an to find with the 

948
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,150
process you're identifying with the 
process.

949
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,030
Anyways,
back to the idea of the constitution.

950
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,283
Well.
So it's predicated on these 

951
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,930
presuppositions that I think have 
religious,

952
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,813
they,
they're derived from religious 

953
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:09,434
presuppositions,
especially the idea of equality of all 

954
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,820
individuals.
Before we go on like that,

955
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,080
that idea is when its explicit form 
that's 2000 years old.

956
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,403
Before that it sort of hung around.
The Egyptians thought that the higher 

957
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,214
level of aristocrats who are perhaps 
equivalent to the pharaoh in terms of 

958
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,124
their potential for a motel,
but it wasn't made explicit till about 

959
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:33,030
2000 years.
So it was implicit.

960
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,470
So it was the kind of story before it 
was explicit.

961
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:40,680
It was in some other form.
So the question is,

962
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,773
we're not conscious of all her stories,
which is for me to say what I mean by 

963
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:49,560
that is that although we have stories 
some of the weekend,

964
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,700
we don't know they're there.
We can explain what they mean.

965
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,000
Some of our stories and the best we can 
do is transmit them in images.

966
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,600
Some of them that we know even less,
well the best we can do is act out.

967
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:02,880
Okay.
Does that,

968
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:06,420
does that make any sense?
It's like we had religious stories.

969
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:07,254
They'd guarded their behavior.
They constituted the basis for our 

970
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,120
unions into groups.
We had these stories,

971
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:12,954
but we didn't know what they meant.
So the story was it encoded in the form 

972
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:17,244
of image and action and not coated in 
the form of any sort of explicit 

973
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:22,770
content.
You couldn't say what it meant.

974
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,310
So you're also saying,
hey,

975
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,520
we've got a nice story.
Tell him,

976
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,380
well,
that gas,

977
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,900
that's exactly the case.
At least that our stories,

978
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,180
it's a causal loop,
right?

979
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,670
Where does he tell the story?
Modifies the behavior,

980
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:40,860
but I would say to the degree that you 
can draw a temporal influences,

981
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,323
the behavior precedes the description of
the behavior at least as often as the 

982
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,570
description proceeds in the behavior it 
needs.

983
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,403
You pointed out then like most most 
western or just sort of have this 

984
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,750
assumption that we construct it more 
rules than we follow.

985
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,130
Nature said,
Donald,

986
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,180
we have more rules than we're embedded 
in our behaviors.

987
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,270
We observe the,
we told stories about them.

988
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:10,470
Then we dissected the stories and we 
came up with general principles.

989
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,990
Then once have you formulated the 
general principles,

990
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,260
we turned around and said that the fact 
that the general principles existed were

991
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:19,770
the reasons for the behavior wrong,
although north completely,

992
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,940
because once you can tell the story and 
once you can make the most explicit,

993
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,520
that can change your behavior,
although it's not so easy.

994
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,930
Yeah.
You were saying that this case,

995
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,400
do you think that that would be stage?

996
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,300
No,
because usually what,

997
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,550
what what religious means is it means 
dogma,

998
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,740
norm spirit,
right?

999
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:42,903
The reason that the church and the state
were separated but I think was quite 

1000
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,543
simple.
You have to make a distinction when you 

1001
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:55,591
talk about religious structures,
the explicit beliefs and the spirit that

1002
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:57,663
moves the entire religion.
It's the same distinction that 

1003
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,460
Dostoyevsky was turning,
making the crab,

1004
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,170
the dogmatic,
pardon?

1005
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,010
The Catholic Church is tyrannical,
absolutely tyrannical.

1006
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,890
All it is concerned with is the 
position,

1007
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,573
but then there's this other part.
This signified a Dostoevsky story by 

1008
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:15,514
Christ.
When those two cards come into contact 

1009
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,170
with them,
the dogmatic aspect attempts to kill the

1010
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:23,750
creative aspect,
but in Dostoevsky story entirely,

1011
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,200
let smoke the back door,
which is again,

1012
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,034
that's why that's a brilliant story.
So the problem with the state and 

1013
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,620
religious because then the religion 
becomes dogma and that's,

1014
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,200
and I think part of the reason that the 
church in the state are separated,

1015
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,063
your part is to stop,
is another barrier stopping that from 

1016
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:42,940
happening.

1017
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,340
But I would also say that the American 
state,

1018
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,720
it is religious as Protestant and it's 
structured conflict.

1019
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:49,563
Right.
You know what I said about organized 

1020
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:52,950
religion being designed to prevent you 
from having a religious experience.

1021
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,030
Right,
right.

1022
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:54,551
Well,
yeah.

1023
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,384
So that's,
that's where the dog with us and a good 

1024
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,350
thing too,
it's a good thing because

1025
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,010
prior to the adolescent stage,
you don't want that sort of experience.

1026
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,844
Like you don't want to expose your child
to the unknown if you want to expose 

1027
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:14,080
them in very measured doses,
under controlled conditions,

1028
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:16,180
in a secure environment.
And then only when,

1029
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,910
only when you can't do that anymore.
You say,

1030
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:19,810
well,
you're on your own.

1031
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,420
And the reason you say that is because 
it's true.

1032
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:24,420
It's like you know,
your mother can get dates for you.

1033
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,570
That's just a condition of life,
eastern intention.

1034
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,540
That's just reality.
So,

1035
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,033
right.

1036
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,893
We were talking about implicit stories.
So let's look at how these stories get 

1037
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,560
constructed.
This is an idea.

1038
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,093
Yeah,
this is,

1039
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,390
okay.
So here's your nasty story structure,

1040
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,130
right?
All the way down.

1041
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:55,780
There are stories.
Well,

1042
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:58,270
how did the stories come about?
Well,

1043
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,900
they come about empiricism.
Why put that in?

1044
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:02,734
For reasons we can argue about that.
These are all different ways that we 

1045
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:06,694
figure out how to behave and sometimes 
we figure out how to behave here and we 

1046
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:13,144
moved back here,
but sometimes we figured out how to 

1047
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:16,204
behave here and we move up here and each
of these levels in forms and alters all 

1048
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:25,900
the other levels
for those stories that are most profound

1049
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,930
stories that we really understand 
poorly.

1050
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,050
What's happened.
Well,

1051
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,490
if you put four people on an island and 
they can't talk,

1052
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,880
they're deaf and dumb,
they're going to organize their behavior

1053
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:43,720
into a particular structure and that 
structure takes into account fee.

1054
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,230
Right now we're assuming that it's a a 
healthy society.

1055
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:48,821
People say,
well,

1056
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:49,900
that's relativistic,
right?

1057
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,850
There's lots of different sorts of 
healthy societies.

1058
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,480
I think that's a crock by the way,
but anyways,

1059
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,513
they're going to,
they have a set number of problems to 

1060
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:03,091
solve and the problems are how does each
individual fulfill those tasks they have

1061
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:04,474
to fulfill in order to live in the 
presence of the other people who are 

1062
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,464
doing the same thing in a domain that's 
bounded by whatever resources happened 

1063
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:12,784
to be there.
So there these people who can't talk 

1064
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,223
can't use language.
We're going to modify each other's 

1065
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:21,440
behavior by an exchange of information,

1066
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,740
reinforcements,
positive reinforcement,

1067
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,143
negative reinforcement,
punishments like we always modify each 

1068
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,204
other's behavior in every social 
interaction by gesture and look and 

1069
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:32,714
attention and inattention,
they're going to construct a way of 

1070
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,430
being that has this structure.
None of them are going to be able to say

1071
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:41,264
what it is say now take that analogy is 
just an idea in imagination and extend 

1072
00:59:46,021 --> 00:59:46,854
that to groups that can boast thousands 
of people who'd been interacting over 

1073
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,443
hundreds of thousands of years.
It's all that social behavior from all 

1074
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:57,674
that social behavior emerges as a 
pattern in so far as the culture is 

1075
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:01,154
successful,
we imitate behaviors that we see as 

1076
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:07,964
successful.
We play with the invitations and 

1077
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:10,514
ritualize the play and dramatize the 
rituals and then we collect our 

1078
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,700
information about how to behave it 
damages.

1079
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,560
We formalize it into myths.

1080
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,093
Once you have a religion established,
which is a codify description of 

1081
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:27,560
acceptable behavioral patterns,
you can start drawing general rules from

1082
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:28,394
it.
Then you can start criticizing so forth 

1083
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:31,124
and so on.
Each emergent level of abstraction 

1084
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,250
alters the function of all the previous 
levels

1085
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:43,370
and that's how we construct our stories.
Now the danger of course is that

1086
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:49,370
having abstract and up the story,
they part of the story,

1087
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,570
you can criticize it and destroy it 
without even understanding what it was.

1088
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:55,404
The dealer then you were destroyed.
We knocks and I think that's what we've 

1089
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:00,320
done.
Once we go up to this level,

1090
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:05,450
all of these levels we were storing to 
behavior and analyze it.

1091
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,970
We developed a scientific methodology 
and said,

1092
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,050
that's not what the universe is like.
Bang everyone.

1093
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,913
All the stories.

1094
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,460
Well,
it's just the stories philosophy.

1095
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,640
Well because,
okay,

1096
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,090
well the bridge from philosophy 
rationalities isn't too too,

1097
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,250
it doesn't seem to be qualitatively 
different.

1098
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:38,400
I mean science was originally called,
right,

1099
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:42,950
but look what are all I would say here.
Is that up to this point,

1100
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,250
right?
Yes.

1101
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,430
That's why I said I didn't know if I 
should put this in.

1102
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,740
It is confused.
Absolutely.

1103
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:57,030
Then that's probably the problem with 
this particular diagram.

1104
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:02,380
Something happened here.
What happened here was that from here to

1105
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:06,440
here when we said knowledge of the 
world,

1106
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,060
what we meant was knowledge of world 
pots,

1107
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:10,903
knowledge of how to behave.
When we got to hear what we said was 

1108
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,073
that the world was a place where fact 
that the world was a place of facts and 

1109
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,070
we saw that the world of facts wasn't 
constructed.

1110
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:27,090
The way the world that you act in was 
constructed in our images,

1111
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:30,530
which is to say there isn't a garden 
handling devil man.

1112
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,373
Isn't that the center of the university?
From a factual perspective and all 

1113
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,770
these,
and from the empirical perspective,

1114
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:38,604
it seems very unlikely that the world 
was created in seven days and so on and 

1115
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:41,964
so forth.
And it looks like there was evolution 

1116
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,700
and that really played havoc with this 
whole sequence of stories.

1117
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,073
The problem was these stories were about
the world as a place to APP and not 

1118
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,820
about the world as a collection of 
facts.

1119
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,690
So made a category error here,
I think,

1120
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,833
and undermined our belief in our 
accumulated how old shoe without ever 

1121
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,200
understanding explicitly.
So

1122
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,933
that maybe shouldn't be there,
but it does come at the end of the 

1123
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:12,120
process of abstraction,
I think from an historic perspective.

1124
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:18,350
So does that help
you still have a residual concern

1125
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:22,963
now?

1126
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,623
I think the enthusiasm that you have,
there's empiricism criticism that that 

1127
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,043
everyone else thinks is empiricism.
Empiricism that that you would like us 

1128
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:32,034
to attain.

1129
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,973
No,
sorry.

1130
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,083
No,
you shouldn't get that complicated with 

1131
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:36,660
this.
I mean I just put down,

1132
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,523
I just put that here because it looked 
to me like it was at the end of the 

1133
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:42,720
historical chain of development.
But it's qualitatively different in some

1134
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:44,200
ways than these things.
Okay.

1135
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,890
This represents a store like,
well part,

1136
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,050
it's complicated because you shouldn't 
have stories.

1137
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:51,780
But I would say yes but,
but it's not,

1138
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,530
it's not so simple because we had 
religion at only afterwards.

1139
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:55,951
No,
no,

1140
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:57,280
that's the problem.
That's why it's,

1141
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:57,640
no,
no,

1142
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,473
no I didn't.
There should be arrows back and forth 

1143
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,790
all the way off but okay,
so because that's what I said,

1144
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,624
every time a new level emerges,
it modifies all the previous levels and 

1145
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:12,390
all the levels that are in front of it.
So you get,

1146
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,420
you get this Lupo cutting a multi 
dimensional causal loop of phenomenon.

1147
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,740
But it does also seem to be a certain 
amount of historicity to it.

1148
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,603
Which is to say that rational philosophy
or even philosophy say that at least as 

1149
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:31,500
an emergent property,
maybe of complex language you use,

1150
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:35,340
it's only been around for 5,000 years 
possibly.

1151
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,860
So it seems,
it's hard to say.

1152
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,380
Do is what pre empirical Sharman 
engaging comparable to philosophy?

1153
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,670
Well,
I don't know either and there's a lot of

1154
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:48,504
arguments about this.
I'm not thinking of this as a simple 

1155
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:51,384
historical progression,
but there's a historical aspect to it I 

1156
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:55,970
think.

1157
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,530
Whereas here it is a qualitative,
um,

1158
01:04:59,140 --> 01:04:59,973
la,
it's a hierarchy because it seems like 

1159
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:03,770
in is a point at which you can,
you can talk,

1160
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,220
you can start experimenting with not 
only objects and facts,

1161
01:05:07,221 --> 01:05:08,510
but also with,
with myths.

1162
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,770
And you can start talking about 
religions in the,

1163
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,613
in an objective manner I guess,
which is what you want to be able to do 

1164
01:05:14,721 --> 01:05:16,160
with what you're teaching.
Well,

1165
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,460
that's possible.
So,

1166
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:18,130
but your philosophy

1167
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
is,
is thinking about these ideas of 

1168
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:22,180
behavior.
Empiricism is actually testing out these

1169
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,014
ideas and behavior and subject to when 
you have a philosophy that some of what 

1170
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,200
Moses,
a formulaic way,

1171
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:32,950
I mean it's clear a lot of play back and
forth.

1172
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,023
I shouldn't have,
I shouldn't have put this in here 

1173
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,583
because when you've used [inaudible] 
instead of what it is in terms of what 

1174
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:40,300
it does to the things that came before 
it.

1175
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,400
That's true.
That's true.

1176
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:45,040
That's the match space of food.
The reason that it's in there is because

1177
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,420
it does.
That's a very good point.

1178
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,553
It has an effect on because each of 
these emergent abilities has an effect 

1179
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:54,160
on everything that goes before the new 
imperialism has,

1180
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,750
has uh,
has a dramatic effect on our,

1181
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,493
on our ability to believe.
The stories that were constructed at 

1182
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,680
this point is with regards to the 
historicity of it.

1183
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,983
It is the case that we organized our 
behavior before we understood how we 

1184
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,140
did.
So our,

1185
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:16,350
our capacity here in here seems to be 
filing genetically more ancient than our

1186
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:21,340
task is farther on down the line.
They also seem to be more linguistically

1187
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:24,010
depending on as you move down the chain,
it's right.

1188
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,113
You get a lot of inventory of behavior 
and invitation with primates a lot and 

1189
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:30,010
they can move a lot of information 
around that way.

1190
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,853
Lord,
Cultural Information and certainly it's 

1191
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:35,740
the case that much of the information 
that we get from each other,

1192
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,050
hookers it down a level and I think 
that's fine.

1193
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:41,080
Genetically more ancient Merlin.
Donald,

1194
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,330
you're never heard of the dorm.
He was here for a while.

1195
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:45,910
I was a visiting scholar.
You gave a quote a couple of years back.

1196
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,043
He wrote a whole book on about a third 
of the book is called the evolution of 

1197
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:53,620
the motor mind on the role of imitation.

1198
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,453
My nieces,
he calls it his culture constructing 

1199
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:57,664
role.
These are place that communicating 

1200
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,990
information about behaviors about,
yeah,

1201
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,370
that's right.
That's right.

1202
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,220
Okay.
That's what they're what?

1203
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,520
Not only that their ways of constructing
stories like Elliot,

1204
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:13,650
he points out,
for example,

1205
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,890
in the Polynesians go fishing with a 
polynesian goes fishing and feminine are

1206
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:22,910
Pretty Empirical Polynesian.
He adopts the guys of the ancestral hero

1207
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,973
who first fish for the Polynesians.
Now Eliana has pointed out that if you 

1208
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:30,820
go back three generations in pretty 
literate cultures,

1209
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,073
all the historical events that occurred 
before that are sort of telescope into 

1210
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:39,910
the time that existed before the present
time and all they remember is the things

1211
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:43,480
that they should remember,
which is how to act and how to act.

1212
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:44,314
Which in this case is how to fish,
is to imitate the ritual model 

1213
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:47,933
efficient,
which is all the Polynesians collection 

1214
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,540
of successful behaviors.

1215
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,673
About how to catch fish that had been 
stored and transmitted down the 

1216
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:59,340
generations using this sort of process.
They imitate,

1217
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,193
say,
well,

1218
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,053
maybe they are.
You can imagine the Polynesian children 

1219
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:07,900
playing out the fishing routine.
It's a ritual as well.

1220
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,250
Who knows?
And that culture,

1221
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,080
maybe it's also something that's 
dramatic.

1222
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:11,914
I don't know.
So I think more more than a historical 

1223
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:17,324
chain.
This is a chain of obstruction and it 

1224
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,410
increases as you go down,
and I think it's

1225
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:24,523
roughly analogous to this behavioral 
information moves from here to here to 

1226
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,960
here.
First we are,

1227
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,183
then we make images of reduction.
Then we tell stories about the end of 

1228
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,844
this,
of the action.

1229
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,940
Then we use words to describe the images
of the action that is a store.

1230
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:42,763
So when I read your Shakespeare in play,
I'm using words to activate memories in 

1231
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:53,270
your imagination of behavioral patterns 
and that's where the inflammation is.

1232
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,630
It's not in the words.
That's why

1233
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,570
people have said that Shakespeare knew 
everything.

1234
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:02,510
That for ideas for example.
That's how I tried to think it explicit.

1235
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:03,683
Shakespearian still implicit still.
I would say most of your information 

1236
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,990
scale here and this system is just 
killing me.

1237
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,350
That's what you do with the kids too.
Anyways,

1238
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,203
the point of all of this was to kind of 
describe our stories be constructed and 

1239
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:23,290
you'd asked the questions wrong stories 
that are implicit to me.

1240
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,940
You're saying anomalous event,
old curves and you say,

1241
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:30,941
well frank the mother and uh,
you can't say what story disrupt.

1242
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,990
Well,
I would say that's in large part because

1243
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:40,370
as you move out to larger and larger 
scale structures of stories,

1244
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,950
in a sense you moved back in a sense you
move backwards in time.

1245
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:49,010
God,
well,

1246
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:49,844
yeah,
because the,

1247
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,810
the stories get more and more archaic 
and less and less explicit.

1248
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,093
So I,
you could ask the average undergraduate 

1249
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,273
what are the presuppositions of the 
American constitution and they might be 

1250
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:04,220
able to list off the rights and then you
say,

1251
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,450
well,
what's outside of that?

1252
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,440
Well,
the English Libertarian tradition,

1253
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,650
English new contribution.
Okay.

1254
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,430
That's philosophy.
That's outside of that.

1255
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,860
Well then then you might get the answer.
Well,

1256
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,410
it's the Judeo Christian culture in the 
western tradition.

1257
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:22,603
Okay.
Things are starting to get pretty vague 

1258
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:24,914
at that point,
which is to say that the outer levels 

1259
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:27,914
are still mostly implicit.
And then the question is what does 

1260
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,990
implicit me?
And I would say,

1261
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:37,110
well what it means is that the 
information there is still lodged mostly

1262
01:10:37,111 --> 01:10:42,111
in image and in coded in behavior,
but not explicit.

1263
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,340
So here's another example.
There's a group of two year olds,

1264
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,550
pre verbal,
two year olds,

1265
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,920
because I grew up for two year olds.

1266
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,200
They're all acting in a very complex 
manner.

1267
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,603
And you go in there and you study,
you're trying to derive rules like 

1268
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:01,130
piaget for their behavior.
It lists all these rules,

1269
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,490
say the children are behaving according 
to those worlds,

1270
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:08,150
which is wrong.
They don't know the rules.

1271
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,383
They can't say that.
Now if you say they're behaving good 

1272
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,483
rules,
what you're saying is that there are 

1273
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:18,090
rules that can,
that can be followed but not stated.

1274
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,500
The polls described.
Yeah,

1275
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,300
but okay,
okay,

1276
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,050
fair enough.
And I would say,

1277
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:25,884
well that's what we're doing to the 
rules described our rules and describe 

1278
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:31,440
our behavior,
but the behavior precedes the rules.

1279
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:36,330
So in what form are the rules?
If they're not explicit,

1280
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,393
like the children are acting out 
patterns that you could use words to 

1281
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:44,080
describe as rules,
where are the patterns?

1282
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,980
What are they,
where are they?

1283
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,803
Well,
they're certainly in the children's 

1284
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:50,814
behavior,
so I would say they're coded into 

1285
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:53,094
procedural memory.

1286
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,680
How do we get there?
The children,

1287
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,813
the children watched their parents act 
and imitating and played with the 

1288
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:05,130
invitation plus in their social 
intercourse,

1289
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,530
not only with their parents but with 
their parents.

1290
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:11,550
Their behavior is constantly being 
modified by the exchange of reinforcers.

1291
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,400
So that constructs a pattern which you 
can use rules to described.

1292
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,253
You can use words to describe where you 
can tell a story about the child's 

1293
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:20,330
behavior,
which is what you very [inaudible],

1294
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:22,750
what he would spend all day studying 
kids and he went home.

1295
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:24,630
You'd said,
I saw the cutest thing today.

1296
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:25,703
Then you tell the story and that would 
be a way of getting the information 

1297
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,094
about this behavior out.
A few levels of abstraction you can 

1298
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,590
codify it to,
I'd say you're engaged in this process,

1299
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:40,290
so
as you go out levels of analysis,

1300
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,500
you go back in time.
That's one way of looking at it.

1301
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,360
You also moved from the explicit to the 
implicit increasing.

1302
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:53,040
So when you say an anomalous event 
occurs and I can identify the story,

1303
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,330
it affects,
I would say,

1304
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:57,550
well,
it's having an impact out of story level

1305
01:12:57,551 --> 01:12:58,500
of it's not explicit.

1306
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:04,680
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1307
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,400
It's unconscious.
It's coated in these images.

1308
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,863
It's coded in the myths.
We're not aware of just telling stories 

1309
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,430
and we're acting it out.
We're,

1310
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,880
we're acting it out.
But look,

1311
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:18,714
if if,
let's say you're severely 

1312
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,730
psychopathological and you go in,
you see a psychologist and you say,

1313
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:28,530
this is my ideal future,
but this is always what keeps happening.

1314
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,663
Well,
I would say there's no isomorphism 

1315
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:35,580
between what's happening here and what's
being stated here,

1316
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:40,110
which is to say the person's actions act
of a story that the person does not know

1317
01:13:40,111 --> 01:13:40,944
explicitly,
which is why union said you should know 

1318
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:43,884
the myth that you're lending to me if 
outbreaks here and here and Mcclellan 

1319
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:50,580
has noted the same sort of thing.
I think it's something that is very much

1320
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,493
analogous.
He says that that's why he looks at the 

1321
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:54,594
thematic apperception test your explicit
statements about who you are and what 

1322
01:13:58,081 --> 01:13:58,680
you want.

1323
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,513
Do not match your episode with 
representations and if you want to 

1324
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,590
predict behavior,
this is to point anyways.

1325
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,330
You look here,
not here.

1326
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,180
So when he's looking for things like 
need for achievement,

1327
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,180
which I think is really interesting 
cause that's Carol and long

1328
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,930
cultures that have a lot of need for 
achievement,

1329
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,793
like themes in their children's stories 
have higher socioeconomic status and 

1330
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:24,370
that's because those are here in this,
the coding here,

1331
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,980
people act them out there,
talk to the kids.

1332
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,970
It's all unconscious.
Then the question is what is unconscious

1333
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,620
mean?
This is what it means.

1334
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,690
It's coated in behavior or it's an 
image.

1335
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,033
It's not yet explicit.
So this is also a way of kind of trying 

1336
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:42,880
to address the idea of the collective 
unconscious in a more

1337
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,970
differentiated manner.
See what it might be.

1338
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,020
Sorry,
but back to my mother.

1339
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,163
Yes.

1340
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,770
Every,
anything owe my entire life.

1341
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,520
Takes all the energy out of your options
in notes,

1342
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,360
listen way,
I can't tie it in.

1343
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,160
And did you go there?
There was nothing that I was going to do

1344
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,190
for that I can't do no right or that I 
shouldn't do.

1345
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:13,510
Now in school serves a purpose
just date,

1346
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,750
which implicitly includes your one goal 
as a state.

1347
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:17,650
Well,
it also,

1348
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,960
it also might,
mortality is a good,

1349
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,770
a good issue because the problem with 
with the,

1350
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:28,480
the dramatic demonstration of mortality 
is that it's the form of,

1351
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,373
it's a form of anomalous information 
that can Noriko your highest levels of 

1352
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:33,514
stories that I heard.
There is severe repercussions because 

1353
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,720
I'm faced with my own mortality.

1354
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,410
I have no,
I would say that this is more and more,

1355
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,500
more particularly the severe 
repercussions are because the story that

1356
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,334
you've been telling yourself no longer 
maintains its validity in the light of 

1357
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:52,324
an event.
That's not dramatic because I would say 

1358
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,453
what?
That's an indication that the story 

1359
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,054
you've been telling yourself does not 
include the fact of mortality as a 

1360
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:05,110
constituent element and is therefore 
vulnerable to bad as an intrusive event,

1361
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,483
which is to say you don't have a story 
that makes sense of mortality and most 

1362
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:12,250
of the Times
shall we go with go ahead.

1363
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,173
Okay.
I was just going to say also I think a 

1364
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:16,354
mother is a culture of other is the guy 
for how to behave in the face of the 

1365
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,100
night.

1366
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,660
That's certainly the case officer.

1367
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,250
Well,
that way if you lose a mother,

1368
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,570
you've really lost.
You've lost your means of knowing how to

1369
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:32,600
behave right in the face of anomalous 
information.

1370
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,013
No,
that's the last of the process because 

1371
01:16:34,801 --> 01:16:35,634
you can't go back to your mother and 
find out how to deal with new 

1372
01:16:37,951 --> 01:16:40,680
information here.
Here's an example.

1373
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:43,350
That's a very good point.
That's much simpler than the way I was.

1374
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,233
I was going about it.
Agoraphobic women often experience a 

1375
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:48,924
dramatic loss in the pre developmental 
period of their pathology and 

1376
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:54,923
agoraphobic people,
I think are people whose stories that 

1377
01:16:57,091 --> 01:17:00,900
collapse completely for
fear of,

1378
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:04,290
it's basically fear of leaving any place
that's viewed as secure.

1379
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,590
So when you used to be called fear of 
open spaces,

1380
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:10,880
but it's more like it's fear of being 
away from security,

1381
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,033
fear to Ventura,
fear of being away from hospitals or 

1382
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,750
doctors or actually figures of authority
is really what it boils down to.

1383
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,980
So you're a 45 or 50 year old woman,
your husband dies,

1384
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,040
your developmental history is,
you're a dependent child.

1385
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:25,874
You married at the age of 17 you relied 
on your husband to make his decisions 

1386
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,983
and he's divorced.
It's like what's happened is your 

1387
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:33,464
culture has disappeared because your 
mode of adaptation was normally what 

1388
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:41,180
does my husband,
so it's recourse to authority.

1389
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,103
So there's a little authoritarian drama 
going on in your family and the tyrant 

1390
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:50,590
and became just die a your own thorough 
information.

1391
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,080
Specific goals
under what circumstances?

1392
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,060
Either.
Yeah,

1393
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,160
either.
It's a huge,

1394
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,633
yeah.
So either it's a huge impact because 

1395
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,263
there are some
super story implicit in which having 

1396
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:19,880
your mother is a big part.
Right.

1397
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:24,881
Realize this,
find that story somewhere or you've lost

1398
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:27,900
your mode of adaptation,
which is that's another cost,

1399
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,353
which is the process.
Your ability now to take Allen's 

1400
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:38,290
information guide and then reintegrate.
You feel you've lost that,

1401
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,410
right?
That kind of grant.

1402
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,670
That is literally the case with 
children.

1403
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,050
Right.
If they lose it,

1404
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:47,570
their parents,
it's like because they're motivated.

1405
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:51,290
The childhood mode of adaptation is 
authoritarian more or less.

1406
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,210
It's like if something anomalous 
happens,

1407
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,180
I asked mom and dad and they tell me 
what to do,

1408
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,170
so when you lose a parent at that age,
you literally do use,

1409
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,020
do lose your process.
It's an authoritarian process,

1410
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:06,240
but it's necessarily most of them to 
kids do some exploratory.

1411
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:11,343
Yeah,
well I was just speaking roughly 

1412
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:15,300
politically.
It's just rich.

1413
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,380
It's like there are different modes of 
adaptation.

1414
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:21,530
Three of them actually I think one is 
recourse to authority.

1415
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,380
One is decadence,
he just give up.

1416
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,813
The other is the pattern that we're 
trying to outline and society's waiver 

1417
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:32,600
between the first two because sometimes 
the solution is authoritarianism.

1418
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,250
There's too many.
Like there's,

1419
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,113
there's too many refugees,
let's close the borders and enforce 

1420
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,753
uniformity.
Or our culture is threatened by forces 

1421
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,100
that we can,
we can't tolerate,

1422
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,790
well we'll just give up the parish.
And I think that's what happened.

1423
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:46,624
[inaudible] enrollments for example.
It's like when they were fighting over 

1424
01:19:49,321 --> 01:19:50,154
the gun,
they had an army to do this perfectly 

1425
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:51,974
sufficient to repel the invading forces 
being too many gods and died of 

1426
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,350
indigestion.
So,

1427
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,720
and then so then the Dallas would say,
well if your culture is out of whack,

1428
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:04,860
it's because there's too much chaos,
furthers,

1429
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:05,580
too much order.

1430
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,890
It was too much.
He ended or there's too much.

1431
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:08,243
You have to put the balance back yet.
And then the proper mode of adaptations 

1432
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,863
walking down the line.
And then that's another example of what 

1433
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:19,380
we're trying to lay out.
Can I just say something maybe coming on

1434
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,670
this other thing.
I mean it seems to me that what,

1435
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,613
what this is to say this whole picture 
to put quite simply is that we are 

1436
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:26,724
creatures of habit and your story,
which is the domain of the known 

1437
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:35,760
includes well is really everything and 
that is experience which includes all of

1438
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:36,594
your history and your mother is one of 
the most fundamental constituents of 

1439
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,584
your entire history.
So even if it doesn't have anything to 

1440
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:47,340
do specifically with any of your higher 
level goals,

1441
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:51,450
it's still blowing holes in your,
in your story,

1442
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:55,890
which disregulates your some of your 
stories for sure.

1443
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,873
But I mean the stories I was going home 
for Christmas to visit her mother for 

1444
01:20:59,101 --> 01:20:59,934
example,
is pretty much that little thing that's 

1445
01:21:02,061 --> 01:21:02,940
there.
The larger,

1446
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:07,710
the more
trauma it's going to cost when it's gone

1447
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,830
because the more you're,
the more you count on it,

1448
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,720
right?
The morning depends on absolutely.

1449
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,170
And that sees because the question we're
trying to answer is here is what can you

1450
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:18,360
depend on when there isn't anything to 
depend on?

1451
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,463
Right.
It's like if you lose a little of the 

1452
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:22,230
coastline,
it's not so surprising,

1453
01:21:22,231 --> 01:21:24,420
but if something drops out of the 
middle,

1454
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:25,290
it's very peculiar.

1455
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,673
Kind of reminds me of that.
It seems to me girls do tend to go from 

1456
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:43,470
here to here without descending to this 
level.

1457
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,300
Therefore,
the

1458
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,400
more of an influence on the adolescent 
female.

1459
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,190
Well,
I've never really,

1460
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,143
I've never really thought about,
I never considered the possibility of 

1461
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:04,344
sex differences in this process.
And I'm sure that there are sex 

1462
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:08,450
differences.
Well,

1463
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:13,130
I'm not even sure what the main,
so

1464
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:18,160
you say,
you said there are three months,

1465
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,353
what do you call
that was used term for Nietzsche called 

1466
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,053
to power,
which I think was basically what he was 

1467
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:32,700
after.
I don't know,

1468
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,110
call it the camel.
The child.

1469
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:37,450
Right,
right,

1470
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:38,703
right.

1471
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,200
So,
um,

1472
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,860
I don't know what you'd call
the third way is,

1473
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:50,130
I mean there's descriptive terms of all 
sorts of business to be used to describe

1474
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,080
it.
It's also,

1475
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,103
you know,
you see books alluded to this at the 

1476
01:22:53,971 --> 01:22:54,631
time,
all the time,

1477
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:57,060
like the razors edge by Somerset Mall.
That's it.

1478
01:22:57,170 --> 01:23:02,170
That's another image of this path 
because it's balanced between to balance

1479
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:06,610
between chaos and order basically to 
raise money is literally amazing.

1480
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,523
Sandwich summer stuff.
Mom's book is about something that 

1481
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:14,041
you've discovered that I go into.
The East is the hero culture.

1482
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:31,550
So what,
what?

1483
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:36,640
Well,
I wanted to show you the notion of these

1484
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:37,474
nested stories and also the idea that 
anomalous inflammation can occur within 

1485
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:50,530
any bounded domain and range and that's 
something that's very interesting.

1486
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:51,933
George Kelly said
it's also the case that anomalous 

1487
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:58,840
information range of effect and there is
a,

1488
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:01,900
there are occasions where you encounter 
a piece of anonymous information.

1489
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,743
It might take decades to recuts have off
on all the levels of analysis that it's 

1490
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,270
actually a challenge because you have to
figure it out.

1491
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,000
I just think something like,
let's take your example again.

1492
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:13,834
If a parent dies,
there are implications for that at all 

1493
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,694
sorts of different levels of analysis.
Some of which might not become evidence 

1494
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:22,144
for for years told them this story.
I was thinking about this more 

1495
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:30,910
particular both niches,
notion of who definitely gone every time

1496
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:33,010
one of these levels of analysis 
collapses and that's up.

1497
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:36,400
Danny definitely gone so to speak.
The God that rules,

1498
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:38,410
no,
the ancient Romans,

1499
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:42,220
they used to think that every different 
room that had it go off and I guess in a

1500
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:46,490
sense what they were alluding to was the
fact that you have different patterns of

1501
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:50,030
goal directed activity in every specific
contexts and they should be doing,

1502
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,553
and I read you that that India met the 
other day about endless cycles of 

1503
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:00,430
embedded creation and destruction and 
that's what these,

1504
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,593
each of these stories goes through this 
process of descent in reconstruction at 

1505
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:08,680
every different level of analysis when 
you encounter something really anomalous

1506
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:12,250
that Lowe's who knows how many new 
story.

1507
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,410
That's the thing.
I guess the only way to think about that

1508
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:17,950
as in terms of the contact of cultures 
that had appeared before the isolated.

1509
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,520
So they did their whole developmental 
history has been separate.

1510
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,500
Then they come together and some 
terrible catastrophe usually.

1511
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:26,980
Well,
it's a catastrophe or to me,

1512
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:30,880
this opportunity
ends on the circumstances

1513
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:39,490
with regards to automation for social 
confidence is

1514
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,170
the thing that people are motivated to 
avoid.

1515
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:51,004
Above all,
the outside thing are involuntary high 

1516
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:55,714
level challenges to stories,
so they're were very much motivated to 

1517
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:07,080
eliminate or ignore or repress or 
otherwise

1518
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:09,853
obliterate any evidence that suggests 
that are higher level structures about 

1519
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,980
or insufficient because when we lose 
those,

1520
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,660
we lose everything.
That's nested loop.

1521
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,340
That's the
anomaly.

1522
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,533
An anomaly that's relevant at one level 
tends to demolish all the levels that 

1523
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:30,660
are inside of all those levels inside of
dependent on that store.

1524
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:43,640
Next class we're going to talk about 
some of them.

1525
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,183
We're going to talk about some of the 
ways that anomalous information 

1526
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:53,150
manifests itself and the basic,
the easiest way to conceptualize that is

1527
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:58,970
that anomaly can occur at any of these 
levels of analysis,

1528
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:03,200
so the mere presence of someone who 
behaves differently,

1529
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:04,034
for example,
can constitute a challenge to the 

1530
01:27:06,081 --> 01:27:06,914
integrity of your stories.
The stories that someone tells us that 

1531
01:27:10,281 --> 01:27:13,030
the Ford,
that's another example of that.

1532
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,310
We'll be here.
Alternative miss can wreak havoc on your

1533
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:16,971
culture.
Can have.

1534
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:21,740
Certainly the case when you think about 
that in terms of the clash of religions,

1535
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:27,230
new ideas can blow your stories.
And all of this information comes in all

1536
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:31,390
of those guys as and their stories about
their stories,

1537
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,130
about his appearance,
each of those guys.

1538
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:36,603
So we're going to talk a little bit 
about how anomalous information 

1539
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:42,590
manifests itself and then the core 
switches into the last half,

1540
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:46,810
which is much more focused on the movie.

1541
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,120
So we have time
well,

1542
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,180
but at the same time there are 
individual differences.

1543
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,023
I mean you've ever,
every individual's episodic and 

1544
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,110
procedural memories.
Yeah.

1545
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:16,260
Well I think,
I mean I think,

1546
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,173
I think it's
gender roles and the West are becoming 

1547
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:25,490
more and more for many cultures.
There's a strict distinction between the

1548
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:26,324
sexes.
There were native native American 

1549
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:30,170
cultures where the men and the women 
spoke different languages.

1550
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:32,630
So it depends on the culture,
but it certainly,

1551
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,310
there are many cultures where,
where women live that that's,

1552
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:41,360
that's the case where we're women had a 
domain of activity that was their sacred

1553
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:42,194
domain and the same with the men.
And there was no cross talk to speak of 

1554
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,673
women to a
traditional domains of women have been 

1555
01:28:55,230 --> 01:29:00,230
closed cloth making pottery and 
agriculture three nontrivial domains.

1556
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,493
Yes,
yes,

1557
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,460
absolutely.
Of course.

1558
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:06,693
Yeah.
I was thinking more specifically 

1559
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:11,780
cultural issues.
So yeah.

1560
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:13,380
And then I would say,
well yes,

1561
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,970
the procedural memories.
Well just to a certain agreement.

1562
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:22,270
This is there in terms of their habits.
Richard Cory story pretty different.

1563
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,773
Well,

1564
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,193
like I said,
this is something that I have agreed 

1565
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:33,993
work though cause I don't know,
a lot of the feminine images in 

1566
01:29:37,811 --> 01:29:38,644
mythology seem to me to be 
representations of the unknown rather 

1567
01:29:42,821 --> 01:29:46,030
than representations of the individual.
And like Newman would say,

1568
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:50,980
well the feminine feminine consciousness
construed as the hero is masculine.

1569
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:51,933
Symbolically it doesn't,
it has nothing to do with gender except 

1570
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:02,730
I suppose perhaps that
the aztecs temps for the Aztecs,

1571
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:08,130
a woman who died in childbirth went to 
the same heaven.

1572
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,050
The warriors when two if they were 
killed in battle.

1573
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,480
Well,
so I would say even there and that's,

1574
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:20,620
that's pretty much good.
Even the bylaws,

1575
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,913
the most biological aspect of a woman's 
role was construed as heroic in that in 

1576
01:30:26,571 --> 01:30:30,530
that particular case.
So as as equivalent to two more.

1577
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,730
What about the idea that the myths that 
are part of our culture,

1578
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,713
it's Disney or something would you 
showed us how to bless her prince 

1579
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:40,304
charming figure who identifies with the 
hero and it goes out and conquers this 

1580
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,123
dragon whatever for the principals or 
rescues the princess and so that people 

1581
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:55,380
will identify along gender lines.
Men are taught to identify,

1582
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:56,223
her boys are taught to identify with the
friends and to what extent women are 

1583
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:03,740
taught to identify with the sort of the 
Barbie doll with the princess or the the

1584
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,420
sort of,

1585
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,253
well this is another issue.
It's like I think one of the reasons 

1586
01:31:08,501 --> 01:31:13,210
that the fairy tales tend to port.
This isn't nice.

1587
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,103
Nice idea.
In light in the Aztec notion that fairy 

1588
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:19,540
tales tend to portray,
we even say us dependent.

1589
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,820
So for someone to rescue them.
Well,

1590
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:22,683
I would say the reason for that is 
because this is my own personal 

1591
01:31:24,971 --> 01:31:29,710
interpretation,
is the in more traditional cultures,

1592
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:30,544
which I would just say,
or cultures that don't have access to 

1593
01:31:32,381 --> 01:31:33,214
reliable birth control,
women aren't necessarily put into a 

1594
01:31:35,851 --> 01:31:39,130
dependent position by the biology and 
the,

1595
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,113
and the notion of heroism that those 
tails sort of portray is voluntary 

1596
01:31:44,111 --> 01:31:44,944
acceptance of that rule and voluntary 
acceptance of the necessity for a 

1597
01:31:48,731 --> 01:31:49,564
protracted period of dependence.
And it's reasonable to construe that as 

1598
01:31:52,271 --> 01:31:53,104
a form of hero is.
So that's why the Aztecs had this 

1599
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:58,810
particular attitude.
Biology,

1600
01:31:58,811 --> 01:32:00,610
Freud,
biology is destiny.

1601
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,590
Well,
that's true and not true.

1602
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,110
It's not so much destiny when you have 
the birth control pill,

1603
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:07,600
but without it,
there's a big chunk of destiny there.

1604
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,333
So,
and it's voluntarily facing the things 

1605
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:16,380
that have to be faced that constitutes 
Hiro is so that,

1606
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:20,940
I don't know how that applies to our age
in an age of birth control.

1607
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:24,510
Still the matter of taught to be here at
the women I've talked to.

1608
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:25,450
Well,
first of all,

1609
01:32:25,451 --> 01:32:28,090
there hasn't been enough time for our 
stories to the change.

1610
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,180
And second,
in many ways things haven't changed.

1611
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:33,220
Like if you,
if you have a baby,

1612
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:35,610
there's a year.
It depends.

1613
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:38,710
You can do with lots of ways you can,
you can put the baby in daycare.

1614
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,593
Well that's a solution of a trump.
All that means is that the dependency 

1615
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:47,170
stage is transferred to someone else.
It's still there.

1616
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:50,020
It's just be moved usually down the 
socioeconomic ladder.

1617
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,273
But anyways,
if you don't choose that you have a one 

1618
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:54,064
year period where there's something 
that's absolutely dependent on you to 

1619
01:32:58,511 --> 01:32:59,344
the degree that it would be really 
useful for you to be able to be 

1620
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:02,374
dependent on someone else.
So to the degree that child rearing 

1621
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:11,350
still is a feminine role and I think 
it's going to be a long time before that

1622
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,010
that changes.
If it ever changes,

1623
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:20,220
who knows what will happen.
The notion of voluntary dependency still

1624
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,420
has an aspect of truth.
That's how I look at it.

1625
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,263
And it's dangerous.
Like there's lots of people who've 

1626
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:30,670
wanted to rewrite fairy tales.
No,

1627
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:31,504
because they have sexist things.
But Shelly pointed out something 

1628
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:36,880
interesting in her last essay.
Tell you the three little pigs,

1629
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:37,714
you know,
they keep building houses and you get 

1630
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:40,660
stronger and stronger.
The wolf closed them down,

1631
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:41,494
but finally they build a stone house or 
a brick house and the wolf climate 

1632
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:45,514
through the chimney,
but he falls into a bowl of water and 

1633
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:47,570
then the pigs eat,
cook,

1634
01:33:47,571 --> 01:33:48,404
and eat him.

1635
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,293
Well,
she always pointed out that in the 

1636
01:33:49,811 --> 01:33:50,644
sanitized versions,
Wolf just pops down the fire decisions 

1637
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,173
his tail,
and he goes back up through the chimney 

1638
01:33:55,991 --> 01:33:57,940
and he gets away.
She meant,

1639
01:33:57,941 --> 01:33:59,620
she pointed out,
well,

1640
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:00,963
the fact of having constructive this 
fortress in the proper manner allowed 

1641
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:08,980
enough of the external unknown,
symbolized by the wolf to enter.

1642
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:13,240
We can be prepared and to simulate it.
Now you say,

1643
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,680
oh,
this is a violent story.

1644
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:16,090
The poor wolf.
Well,

1645
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:21,010
it's like you're thinking here about 
something that's all encoded here.

1646
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,400
So you mess around with,
you say,

1647
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:23,243
well,
it'd be much nicer if the wolf gone 

1648
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:24,881
away.
All right,

1649
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:25,714
fine.
But there's no story that we just like 

1650
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,820
the reason you built the stone house,
it's so that you can cook any the wolf.

1651
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,300
Well you lose the graphic imagery,
you lose the story.

1652
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:38,830
And that's the problem with messing 
about with traditional tales.

1653
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:39,664
I mean I can understand why people want 
to do it and there's lots of traditions 

1654
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:43,330
perhaps than artists,
so beneficial.

1655
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,123
But
it might be good to understand that 

1656
01:34:48,011 --> 01:34:48,844
before they are trans transformed.
The other thing is is that we do not 

1657
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:55,240
have an answer to the question.
What constitutes a valid feminine idea?

1658
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,040
Um,
well just about the feminine part of the

1659
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:03,770
wanting to say.
It seems to me that what the feminine,

1660
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,083
the Feminine
counterpart of exploratory behavior is 

1661
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:10,973
endurance of the rather than exploration
feed meals through myth are taught to 

1662
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:18,164
endure.
Not necessarily dependency I don't 

1663
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:22,190
think,
but just just to endure it,

1664
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,370
to sit there and write it out.
And um,

1665
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:28,850
it seems to me that that in fairy tales,
Gannon mythology,

1666
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,073
that's what the four females have to do.
They don't get to actively explore the 

1667
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:37,200
and just endure it.
And that's how they,

1668
01:35:37,201 --> 01:35:40,370
we come here because the thing is if you
have a problem,

1669
01:35:40,371 --> 01:35:41,204
there's two things you can do about it.
You can either change how you're 

1670
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:43,483
accurate.

1671
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:44,723
Right.
I do think it's the case among human 

1672
01:35:49,681 --> 01:35:54,681
beings in general
are view down is both more necessary.

1673
01:35:55,861 --> 01:35:58,560
I'm more expendable,
both at the same time.

1674
01:35:58,770 --> 01:35:59,603
So I met Andrew sent off to war foods,
got a lot of useless side less than men 

1675
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:03,841
hanging road.
Well,

1676
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,810
that's a good thing for them to do and 
that's basically how society worked.

1677
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,330
Boys,
all boys fight wars,

1678
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,793
they're expendable.
The thing about something that's 

1679
01:36:12,271 --> 01:36:13,104
expendable is then it can also be 
something that's very creative because 

1680
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:19,930
exploration is dangerous and if you lose
a few adolescent males while they're off

1681
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:22,650
exploring around,
well,

1682
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:25,160
okay,
you know,

1683
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,910
tough luck.
Whereas women,

1684
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:28,500
well you to have them around.

1685
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:32,380
Well that's all that goes to my question
that I asked you yesterday.

1686
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:33,214
Can there be too many heroes?
It seems to me there's only a certain 

1687
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:40,420
amount of creativity that any society 
can endure at a given time.

1688
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,620
If you've got everybody out there trying
to bring the end.

1689
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,780
That's why I mentioned today that there 
are three patterns.

1690
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,450
Adaptation.
There is recourse to authority.

1691
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,910
That's the authoritarian.
There's whatever we're talking about and

1692
01:36:54,911 --> 01:36:55,744
there's decadence and decadence occurs 
when under the guise of constant 

1693
01:37:00,401 --> 01:37:02,520
creative behavior,
everything he's on the fine,

1694
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:06,830
but it's the case.
Your old man says when you explore,

1695
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,150
you bring your culture along with you 
and that because you're right,

1696
01:37:10,151 --> 01:37:14,440
you're absolutely right.
I mean constant heretical activity.

1697
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:17,180
You mean the Catholic church in middle 
ages burned heretics.

1698
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:18,100
So why was that?
Well,

1699
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:21,700
because you couldn't say there was that 
anytime and feeling you're going to give

1700
01:37:21,701 --> 01:37:22,431
them any,
we'll touch you.

1701
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:25,960
There's like 250 religious visionaries 
wandering around.

1702
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,293
Well,
they followed them to establish a 

1703
01:37:27,971 --> 01:37:28,804
religion.
Well instantly you have 250 countries 

1704
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:33,520
all fighting with one another.
The Catholics,

1705
01:37:33,521 --> 01:37:35,380
they didn't know and we still don't 
know.

1706
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:40,381
How do you mediate between competing 
moral claims knows suppressant.

1707
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,300
Why?
Cause you need to order.

1708
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:44,673
Well,
Darren was their attitude and it's 

1709
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:48,010
understandable and you saying well the 
inquisition and so on.

1710
01:37:48,011 --> 01:37:48,551
Yeah.
Well,

1711
01:37:48,551 --> 01:37:49,840
no kidding.
It's a terrible thing.

1712
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:51,963
I'm not saying it's not a terrible thing
to bunch of order is a catastrophe and 

1713
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:59,610
so was too much chaos come too much.
Cannabis is generated by careless,

1714
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:00,444
creative back,
careless activity that runs under the 

1715
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:07,200
guise of hero,
but that's why they miss safe.

1716
01:38:07,201 --> 01:38:08,034
You're going to be here and you master 
the culture first before you and you're 

1717
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:11,394
buying it because otherwise he might do 
something careless that you think is 

1718
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:14,724
creative that blows everything is like a
minor example is the modification of 

1719
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:20,130
that 30 day.
So keeping them being,

1720
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:20,964
telling them I'm fairy tale for God only
knows how long and someone comes along 

1721
01:38:23,611 --> 01:38:24,960
and chops the ending off.
It's like,

1722
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,430
oh,
this isn't violent.

1723
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:29,880
That isn't even at the point.
That's careless.

1724
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,450
The SEC,
so not is definitely a danger.

1725
01:38:33,451 --> 01:38:35,430
When I said the Romans died,
it digest it.

1726
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,293
That's not a joke.
It's like they expanded like math 

1727
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:41,550
collected all these gods.
It's like their morality was,

1728
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:45,480
was was decimated.
They didn't know how to,

1729
01:38:45,481 --> 01:38:49,340
I'm getting more so in nature.
That's a neat unity.

1730
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:52,260
That's the morning of European is full 
been in cultures.

1731
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,180
So that's why we're at war with 
ourselves

1732
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:03,810
historically and cultural constructions 
of gender or

1733
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:07,350
simultaneously like,
um,

1734
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:12,330
the mother or like the source of all 
things and yet the unknown.

1735
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,810
Right.
So it's interesting to look at the woman

1736
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:16,830
and say,
you know,

1737
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:20,880
how she sees herself rough,
how she says your story because yes,

1738
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:22,940
she had one,
one,

1739
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,260
one or scratch.
She is the source of all things.

1740
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:28,690
And the other respect she has dean.
And you can look like culturally,

1741
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:30,360
like when you talked about the 
inquisition,

1742
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:32,190
like at that time,
the woman,

1743
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,900
we're all being witches because,
um,

1744
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:38,040
basically they were trying to uphold the
tradition.

1745
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:39,510
Um,
so they were all good,

1746
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:39,901
just,
you know,

1747
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:42,240
doing these crazy rituals and they were 
the threat.

1748
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,950
They are the enemy.
They were the know.

1749
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:46,260
Whereas like,
um,

1750
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:50,580
which is something we'll start rolling 
through our history.

1751
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,730
The woman is,
which can cure danger,

1752
01:39:52,731 --> 01:39:53,800
you know,
and you know,

1753
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,490
yeah.
Well that's the split.

1754
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:00,860
The split of the archetype is the 
archetype of the unknown is feminine and

1755
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:04,610
Feminine Femininity has two positive and
negative and positive.

1756
01:40:04,611 --> 01:40:05,444
The medieval culture that was sort of 
wrapped up in symbolism around the 

1757
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,673
Virgin Mary and the other counselors 
sort of more occupied this territory of 

1758
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:16,410
the witch.
So is he going to do,

1759
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,253
so I'm just reiterating your point.
You that applies to fit females is very 

1760
01:40:22,461 --> 01:40:25,370
complicated because you have all these 
different aspects.

1761
01:40:25,371 --> 01:40:26,204
The embodiment of the unknown plus the 
capacity for her rote behavior be more 

1762
01:40:30,531 --> 01:40:30,851
than than,
than,

1763
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:34,160
than creative and
exploratory behavior.

1764
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:37,050
And those two things are hard to me.
There are

1765
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:40,390
two stories that are very different on 
the woman tells her story,

1766
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,413
the story that she's trying new things 
and then she's a witch and she has to 

1767
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:50,110
integrate that because you have to 
understand yourself or stories you,

1768
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,130
when women were separated during that 
stretch,

1769
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,353
nope,
they had to incorporate that into who 

1770
01:40:57,671 --> 01:40:58,341
they were.
You know,

1771
01:40:58,341 --> 01:40:59,174
they were danger that.
So there's two different stories and I 

1772
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:04,750
think that's ultimately left the store 
of a problem,

1773
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:07,180
understanding who you are,
the middle also,

1774
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:13,270
all three,
all three pieces of the entire world,

1775
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,340
both,
both you and kill you.

1776
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:17,440
Right.
So if that's true,

1777
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,040
that's true.
That's true.

1778
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:24,600
That's true.
Well,

1779
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:32,810
I don't like,
I don't know how true that is.

1780
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:35,920
I suspect that,
I doubt that it's true because,

1781
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,630
well,
here's an example.

1782
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,170
If you want to predict the education 
status of a child,

1783
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,050
the best predictors,
mother's level of education,

1784
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,083
farthest of the two parents,
father's level of education does not 

1785
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:51,520
correlate well.
It correlates with the mother's level of

1786
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:54,220
education.
So that's true,

1787
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:55,070
but it does,
doesn't,

1788
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:59,100
is not anywhere near as good as good a 
predictor for the child's development in

1789
01:41:59,101 --> 01:41:59,934
his mother's lap.

1790
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,833
So,
and I think it's reasonable to say that 

1791
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:03,094
in large part,
women are the primary socialization 

1792
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:06,970
agents.
At least they have been historically for

1793
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:10,690
the first two years,
three years,

1794
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,810
maybe even longer than that.
So I don't,

1795
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,673
I don't.
Plus I also don't think that women's 

1796
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:19,360
role in history has been nearly as 
subordinate.

1797
01:42:19,361 --> 01:42:21,880
And as people generally claim,
it depends on your,

1798
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,730
on your standard for defining 
subordination.

1799
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:25,583
I'm not saying that there's,
there were that at every level of 

1800
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:29,960
analysis,
functionally quality range.

1801
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:33,470
Cause that's not true.
But I also think that women and men,

1802
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:37,810
men doesn't impact on the course of 
giving them,

1803
01:42:37,811 --> 01:42:40,990
develop
their contributions.

1804
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,633
I don't think,
I don't really think that we might have 

1805
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:50,310
been session male structure.
You are just like that.

1806
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:51,580
The fact,
for example,

1807
01:42:51,581 --> 01:42:54,600
their men are all the sacrifice,
but nor is one example of that.

1808
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:56,650
That tends to be overlooked in peaceful 
times.

1809
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,170
Well
sacrifice.

1810
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:07,570
How
well fairly fair enough.

1811
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:08,404
I mean there are problems in gender 
relationships and an adaptation 

1812
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:14,110
everywhere in peaceful times.
Maybe men have the upper hand,

1813
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:17,170
but more
the situation,

1814
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:22,410
at least historically these movers
directly voted to take

1815
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:35,260
it was through the perspective of mail,
written history,

1816
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,690
tradition,
and

1817
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,453
sort of
develop the idea of freedom because 

1818
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,390
they're the ones that had
kind of freedom.

1819
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,580
I think women have been powerful.
Yeah,

1820
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,423
so I agree with you,
but I think they've been written into 

1821
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:54,884
history from the male perspective and 
that could be us or women have had a 

1822
01:43:58,721 --> 01:44:00,720
huge,
their story has been written by now.

1823
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,320
Stories are written by people who have 
leisure.

1824
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:07,130
That's right.
Our primary child care,

1825
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,790
especially if that also shortens your 
lifespan.

1826
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,493
Women's influence,
maybe large and implicit in what the 

1827
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:17,960
stories and the items are.
All exquisite needs.

1828
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:18,803
You said that one of the reasons western
culture was so powerful was because his 

1829
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:23,100
philosophy was written by bachelors.

1830
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,970
Good observation,
observation.

1831
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:33,971
But it does take leisure.
Leisure.

1832
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:46,240
We started the course.
Yeah.

1833
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:53,773
Well one of the things I was trying to 
do at the beginning of the class was to 

1834
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,820
out how an explicit story puts 4 
million,

1835
01:44:57,821 --> 01:45:01,010
can fund your mind.
A whole sequence of implicit stories.

1836
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,020
That's really the notion behind the 
conflict between

1837
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,060
miracle stories.
Really explicit.

1838
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:14,450
You can grasp
once you accepted.

1839
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:20,800
I've been thinking about
why it is,

1840
01:45:20,801 --> 01:45:21,634
I'm a singer and I see a lot of a lot of
homosexuals in the art scene and stuff 

1841
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,120
like that.
And I was wondering why,

1842
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,640
you know,
why is it that they tend to,

1843
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,100
a lot of them tend to go into the arts 
and,

1844
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,230
and,
and are very successful at it.

1845
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:40,650
And I was thinking that maybe because 
they are forced to a lot of times to um,

1846
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,720
to partake in a group that they aren't 
necessarily a part of our,

1847
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:47,810
at least for us in that heterosexuality 
is adolescence.

1848
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,913
And then have to have to fight out of 
that had to have a really huge internal 

1849
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,840
struggle if they ever do make it out of 
it.

1850
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:54,953
Um,
and then at that point they are able to 

1851
01:45:56,151 --> 01:45:56,984
add,
they're able to add more to the group 

1852
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:03,080
through things like our creative 
processes,

1853
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,223
sorry,
builds up creative ability or that they 

1854
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:11,480
advanced at an earlier age because they 
have this,

1855
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:12,420
you know,
the saying that they want,

1856
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,363
and this is by the way,
this enormous anomalous information I 

1857
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,193
thought about sometimes in terms of the 
necessity for people who are homosexual 

1858
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:23,774
to integrate different gender roles.
And so I thought they could serve the 

1859
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:32,330
people in that position because the fact
that homosexuality is very peculiar from

1860
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:33,164
an evolutionary point of view,
it's hard to account for its existence 

1861
01:46:35,241 --> 01:46:38,240
from the blue.
And I thought,

1862
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:39,074
well maybe we need to do a particular 
cultural intermediary between the sexes 

1863
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:43,304
possibility or,
or in between the mental logic in the 

1864
01:46:44,991 --> 01:46:46,340
meetings with the masculine and 
feminine,

1865
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:49,620
you have another hypothesis.
You know,

1866
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:53,100
sometimes one of the best niches if 
doesn't kill you,

1867
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,920
makes you stronger.
Sometimes best trade you can have really

1868
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:59,910
cool because if you overcome it well,
then you've got something.

1869
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:02,160
Although you might die.
Just

1870
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:04,853
the downside.

1871
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,940
Okay,
so next week we talked about,

1872
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:09,983
no two weeks.
