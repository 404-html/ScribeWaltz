1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Yeah,
my neighbors,

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,700
astronomers,
it's got a picture of like

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,580
Jimmy Hoffa,
see his head still attached with nobody.

4
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,550
I mean the things they could do with 
photography or so when

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
there is a little bit there is an 
article,

6
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,810
but no more pictures,
pictures,

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,980
pictures,
great grandmother

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,880
for two minutes after class.
Anything that makes a difference to

9
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,940
shape and a bunch of those,
but there's lots of.

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,760
I guess this is
great.

11
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,630
Okay,
so today we're going to

12
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,230
want to
pass the picture.

13
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,050
You can.
We'll take a look at

14
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,370
this picture here.
This is very interesting.

15
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,204
I think there's a number of pictures 
like this from around this time period 

16
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
in European art.
This is about the best complete 

17
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,640
representation that I've seen.
Alright,

18
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,460
so I'll pass this around.
Anyways,

19
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,140
the picture is divided into two halves.
On the right side.

20
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,610
This is the tree of life.
The tree of knowledge of good and evil,

21
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,550
sort of combined into one image,
which is not all that infrequent.

22
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,960
On the right side of the images,
Eve Adam sitting in the background here,

23
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,220
eve is handing out fruit from the tree,
taking it from a serpent's

24
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,360
mouth,
by the way,

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,780
that's the certainty of chaos.
Taking the apple from the serpents mouth

26
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:06,614
and handing into humanity over here and 
in the background is this figure that 

27
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,080
clearly represents death.
And also you'll note in the tree,

28
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,790
one of the apples is replaced by a 
sculptor.

29
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,243
Alright,
then on the right hand or the left hand 

30
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,854
side of the image,
there's a figure that represents the 

31
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:26,731
church given maternal forum here seen as
a counterpart to eve and,

32
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,530
uh,
there's a picture of Christ crucified up

33
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,000
in the branches of the tree.
And that,

34
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,853
that symbolizes the notion that the old 
Christian notion that Christ was the 

35
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,540
second fruit of this tree.
So the first fruit was the,

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,333
was the fruit that bestowed on people 
knowledge of good and evil that had as 

37
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:49,150
its negative consequence consciousness 
of death.

38
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
And the second fruit was the figure of 
the hero here who's construed in most 

39
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:58,981
myths as the answer to the question that
was posed by the original event.

40
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,380
So you say Christian store story makes a
loop,

41
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,360
basically it posits that there's a 
problem,

42
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:08,860
which is the fact of mortality or the 
fact of knowledge of mortality depending

43
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,710
on how you look at it and that there's 
also an answer to that problem,

44
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,280
which is whatever pattern of being as 
represented by this figure.

45
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,563
So the thing that the finger 
representing the church is handing out 

46
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,074
our hosts and the hosts and the Catholic
mass or theoretically considered to be 

47
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,980
equivalent to Christ's body.
And that's a wrap.

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,340
That's a reference to really archaic.
Um,

49
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,380
what would you say?
Archaic Sacrificial Symbology,

50
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,290
incredibly archaic nature based on the 
notion that if you ingest something that

51
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,124
you can become like it,
which is the idea that sort of stands 

52
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,620
behind the mass.
So,

53
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,081
um,
anyways,

54
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,720
you can take a look at this painting one
that sorted like it,

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,053
although it's not quite as good an image
in this particular book on page 121 

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,280
expressing the same sort of idea.
So I'll just pass that around.

57
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,544
You can take a look at it,
think about it because it makes a nice 

58
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,220
background for the talk Landis class 
off,

59
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,530
which is today.
So

60
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,170
I'm gonna read you some things today 
from the last part,

61
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,023
the Spanish girl,
because while I spent a long time 

62
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,100
constructing them,

63
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,513
I think they're more

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,500
because I have to cover a tremendous 
amount of material today.

65
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,340
I don't want to miss the two essential 
lines of the argument.

66
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,174
So,

67
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,043
um,

68
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,013
this whole course has been aimed at 
trying to understand motivations behind 

69
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,130
acts of cruelty that have no apparent 
justification.

70
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,803
So one of the things that we've been 
trying to understand is what forces 

71
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,034
motivate individuals to,
to protect their social territory in 

72
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,940
general.
And the idea is,

73
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,210
well,
will you shut the door please?

74
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,383
Thanks.

75
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,600
So I mean the initial hypothesis 
basically is predicated on the idea that

76
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:21,340
people have an innate response to the 
abnormal.

77
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,203
He is terrifying at first encountered,
particularly if that encounter is 

78
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,054
voluntary.
And the reason we construct 

79
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,460
organizations of social order is to keep
that novelty at bay,

80
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,600
which is to say that we would rather 
live where there's order.

81
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,434
Then we're,
there's chaos because chaos has an 

82
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,870
intrinsically overwhelming how effective
valence.

83
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,603
So we have one level of motivation to 
protect our territory that stems purely 

84
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,050
from,
from,

85
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,110
uh,
our psychobiology.

86
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,920
Everything stems from our psychobiology 
I suppose,

87
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:02,921
when it's most clear there,
then there's a second level of phenomena

88
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:03,914
that have to be accounted for him.
And I've told you some stories more 

89
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,784
recently that Gold Hagen had gathered 
together when he was talking about the 

90
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,060
Nazi death camps near the end of the 
war,

91
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,810
making the point that the Nazis did not 
assuming that they were motivated as you

92
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:20,954
might assume,
by the desire to take over the world to 

93
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,384
dominate the world,
which would be motivated by the desire 

94
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,490
to spread their particular pattern of 
beliefs everywhere.

95
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,323
So there was no chaos anymore anywhere.
You would expect that when they put 

96
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,610
people like the Jews are the Gypsies 
into the concentration camps,

97
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,444
that they would have tried to extract 
from them as much productive labor as 

98
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:42,710
possible in order to further this 
particular man.

99
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,800
But it seems to be the case at least 
frequently,

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,993
that the Labor that was extracted from 
the victims in the concentration camps 

101
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,674
was had no productive value whatsoever,
certainly wasn't useful in furthering 

102
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,484
the cause of the war.
It may have even happened it evidently 

103
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:02,684
at that point,
because of course the Germans lost 

104
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,493
tremendous amount of their intellectual 
capacity when when the lucky Jewish 

105
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:12,290
intellectuals managed to escape their 
clutches,

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,890
Gold Haggett points out in social units 
and details,

107
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,890
this sort of thing quite frequently to 
that much labor,

108
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,724
so to speak,
was only implemented for the purpose of 

109
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,630
cruelty and humiliation.

110
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,463
So Gold Hagen tells a story about a 
typical work operation which involved 

111
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,633
moving a large rock from one place to 
another wellbeing beat and then moving 

112
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,084
it back,
which is a parody of work not work 

113
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,874
itself.
And obviously only instituted to 

114
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,214
humiliate and,
and torture people who are already 

115
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,110
bought as victimized as you could 
possibly imagine.

116
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,221
Uh,
you know,

117
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,040
you need another level of motivation 
now,

118
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,740
that level of explanation to account for
that sort of phenomena,

119
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,870
which is gratuitous,
cruelty or even cruelty as a,

120
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,780
as a sort of aesthetic,
as a way of life,

121
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,600
as something worth pursuing in and of 
itself,

122
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,113
and I don't think you can understand,
you don't understand what human beings 

123
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,394
are like.
You certainly don't understand 

124
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:06,804
motivation for acts of social conflict 
until you get both parts of the story 

125
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,980
sort of firmly embedded in your mind.
So you could say,

126
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,814
well,
it's more purely the case that the fear 

127
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,144
of unknown territory and motivates our 
desire to associate it with a group 

128
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,570
group is composed of people whose 
actions we can predict.

129
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,430
Furthermore,
while we're in that group,

130
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,050
we can predict our own actions,
so pretty.

131
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,200
That pretty much keeps the novelty of 
the environment,

132
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,750
so to speak at bay,
but also the novelty that's,

133
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,010
that's,
that's in other people and ourselves

134
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,963
and you needed then you,
but then you have to account for this 

135
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,980
other level of phenomenon.

136
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,790
The way I attempted to do that was
by discussing mythologies of the dawn of

137
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,340
consciousness.
Two of them in particular,

138
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,110
the Buddhist,
the mythology of the

139
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,790
initial stages of the enlightenment of 
the Buddha and also the myth,

140
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,780
the methods containing the story of 
genesis which describes how Adam and eve

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,960
ate the fruit of the tree,
of the knowledge of good and evil,

142
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:13,794
and then immediately became aware not 
only of their own mortality but of 

143
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,240
everything that that sort of signified,
which was

144
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,470
partly the fact that they were going to 
die.

145
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,513
Partly the fact that now it was 
necessary for them to make moral 

146
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,360
choices.
They have that capacity part of it.

147
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,194
They were going to have to work in that.
That's something that we haven't 

148
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,254
concentrated on that much.
They have to work to sustain their 

149
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,894
existence.

150
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,583
You only.

151
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,693
You only have to work when you can 
envision negative possibilities that 

152
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,520
your instincts would not have normally 
construed of themselves.

153
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,290
Mean animals don't work.
They just live.

154
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,124
We work because we can imagine a 
plethora of negative possibilities that 

155
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,804
do not exist in the present and we're 
always attempting to ensure that they 

156
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,194
don't exist in the future as well,
which is just a hypothetical place in a 

157
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:58,884
sense,
but we're the fact that we work means 

158
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,884
that were dissociated in a sense from 
what we'd like to do because we 

159
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,813
certainly normally juxtapose work with 
what we would like to do and the two 

160
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,280
aren't in the same category.
Work is what you do,

161
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,900
so you get to do what you would like to 
do,

162
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,980
at least under normal circumstances,
so part of the fall,

163
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,660
part of the consequences of the fall or 
the rise into selfconsciousness,

164
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,790
depending on how you look at it,
was the necessity of endless work.

165
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,313
So knowledge of death,
endless work had basically about some 

166
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,190
stuff.
Of course,

167
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,910
it's also the case that went out to 
become self conscious.

168
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:35,580
He puts on his fig leaf.
He adopts the trappings of culture.

169
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,593
He also immediately hides from God and 
while those ideas are all tangled 

170
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:41,724
together in the Genesis Meth,
I mean Adam Heights from God because 

171
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:48,260
he's ashamed and the reason he's ashamed
just because he's clearly recognizes his

172
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,230
own vulnerability

173
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,853
and

174
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,980
that vulnerability,
the recognition that

175
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
that vulnerability makes it impossible 
for him to to exceed to God or to see 

176
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,330
God,
at least in the mythological story,

177
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,164
and I think what that trying to 
represent this in part of the fact that 

178
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,990
it's knowledge of our own vulnerability 
that makes us doubt our,

179
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,480
our.
What would you say are

180
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,693
our fitness in the sight of God?
It's hard to talk about this without 

181
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,114
lapsing into mythological terms.
It's knowledge of Berlin vulnerability 

182
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,384
that leads to our own shame.
I guess that's the simplest way to put 

183
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,234
it and that makes us hide from the 
possibilities in ourselves that have 

184
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,580
been our most potent.

185
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,490
Yeah,

186
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,400
so are.
Then I told me a little bit of a split,

187
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,250
a story that sort of went like this.
I mean that there's a feedback loop in a

188
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:44,030
sense that's generated as a consequence 
of the dawning of self consciousness and

189
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:47,150
one is that one is the generation of 
shame.

190
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,300
The other is the moving away from 
destiny that's most appropriate.

191
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,720
That leads to a weakening of character,
weakening of character,

192
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:59,300
makes the world seem much more terrible 
than it is because

193
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,963
wow,

194
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,950
as you lose sight of the process that 
can allow you to adapt to things the way

195
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:08,784
they are.
It is the case that things that you can 

196
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:16,911
no longer handle take on a more and more
aggressive and hostile and vicious face.

197
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,763
So I guess the simplest way to look at 
that is to think that in the world is 

198
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:26,460
such a complex place,
so unpredictable at its essence.

199
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:30,960
It's so charged with danger everywhere 
that in order to adapt to it properly,

200
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:33,390
it's necessary to utilize all of your 
resources.

201
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,093
Your own knowledge of your own 
limitations is enough to stop you from 

202
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:39,600
bleeding.
That those resources have any value.

203
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,420
The more you move away from those 
resources,

204
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,293
partly because they take work partly 
because you don't believe in them 

205
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,160
anymore that week or you get and the 
more terrible the world.

206
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,253
Paris Hilton basically represented that 
part in his description of Satan's 

207
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,354
generation of hail,
around tying in another complex aspect 

208
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,124
of the argument,
which was the inability to admit to 

209
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,253
error.

210
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,620
It's hard.
It's hard

211
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,713
in brief,
to demonstrate how old those ideas are 

212
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,663
are pain without.
I guess the basic notion is that it's 

213
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,213
knowledge of our own essential 
vulnerability that makes us lack belief 

214
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:26,964
in our capacity to face the consequences
of our own errors or even to admit that 

215
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,020
those errors are there.
Without that capacity,

216
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,010
it's impossible for us to further the 
development of our personalities because

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,593
it's only after admission of air that 
further exploration can take place and 

218
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,540
it's out of the consequences of 
exploration.

219
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:50,541
That personality is generated and the 
terrors of the world

220
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,520
transformed into something either 
positive or at least irrelevant.

221
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,220
Okay,
so what we're hoping to do today to some

222
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,780
degree in a very brief period of time,
is to describe how that process,

223
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,193
how all the negatives that are 
associated with with the processes that 

224
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,701
we've described might be overcome to 
some degree can to start that by reading

225
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,610
something.
I guess the argument basically hinges on

226
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,720
this point,
so does the fact that there are negative

227
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,250
things necessarily corrupt.

228
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,410
You can see.
Nietzsche said,

229
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,470
and I
quoting his David last week,

230
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,323
he said that everyone who
only he who suffers from an actuality 

231
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,394
has motivation to lie himself out of it,
and of course that that statement was 

232
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,660
his attempt to account for human 
behavior in general making the case.

233
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:10,090
Then we all have reason to suffer from 
actual on the m,

234
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,460
therefore are all motivated to lie 
ourselves out of it.

235
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Freud took an extreme position like that
saying that our fear of reality,

236
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,250
which was essentially knowledge of our 
own mortality,

237
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,593
was sufficient to have generated all of 
the religious and the artistic 

238
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,184
structures that we've erected,
which Freud basically regarded as 

239
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,173
neurotic delusions against the anxiety 
about death as a powerful argument type 

240
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,533
thing.

241
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,253
I guess the problem I have with that 
particular perspective is that it's 

242
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:44,900
extraordinarily,
it's extraordinarily pessimistic because

243
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,680
it basically predicated on the idea that
unvarnished reality,

244
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,260
so to speak,
is of necessity,

245
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,700
so terrible that it's impossible to face
it,

246
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,120
so then some,
some false,

247
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,323
some sort of has to be erected between 
you and your actual experience in order 

248
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,734
to make that experience tolerable.
Now I can understand the rationale 

249
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,474
behind that argument.
It's brings up again in these social 

250
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,630
psychological studies that we'd be.
That idea springs up again.

251
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,200
You know that a certain amount of 
dilution is necessary for mental health.

252
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,793
Well,
I guess really what I want to do is 

253
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,130
explore the other day and they look at 
the opposite perspective,

254
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,090
which is that,
well,

255
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:24,140
no,
that's not right.

256
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,760
It's insufficient grasp of reality that 
makes it two terrible.

257
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,030
The mayor and the story I want to tell 
you today is the story about,

258
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,153
um,

259
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,350
how about the exploration of that 
particular hypothesis.

260
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,573
And the first thing I did,
I thought I might be useful because one 

261
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:40,904
of the things we've been trying to do in
this class so far is to draw 

262
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,274
distinctions between things you know,
so that we can figure out distinctions 

263
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:46,874
between various negative things and 
distinctions between various positive 

264
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,153
and to look at how the mythological 
imagination categorizes the world so 

265
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,810
that we can understand it more 
rationally.

266
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,093
What are the things that I think is very
useful to draw a distinction between 

267
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,693
when we're talking,
when we're trying to answer the 

268
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,254
question,
is the world so terrible that cannot be 

269
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,863
actually proceed properly,
is to attempt to draw a distinction 

270
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,430
between evil and tragedy.
And I'm going to.

271
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,610
Because it's certainly the case.
Look,

272
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,923
it's certainly the case as we all know 
that in the course of our life we're 

273
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,213
going to encounter the same sort of 
phenomenon of the Buddha encountered 

274
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,260
when he went outside of his outside of 
his castle walls.

275
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,553
And there's no possibility in anyone's 
existence for them to escape sickness 

276
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,450
for old age or death.
I mean those,

277
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,510
those things are absolutely certain and 
certainly tended with negative effect,

278
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:47,560
at least in terms of their apprehension,
so the question is under those,

279
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,920
given that those are the background 
conditions of existence,

280
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,470
is it possible?
Nonetheless,

281
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,333
that existence can be positive enough so
that it can be apprehended accurately 

282
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:57,754
instead of hidden from.
And I think one of the things that you 

283
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,204
have to understand before you can answer
a question like that is the nature of 

284
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:05,794
the distinction between evil and tragedy
and in order to address that 

285
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,294
distinction,
I turned first to an argument that was 

286
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,860
put forth by Ivan in the brothers 
Karamazov,

287
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:18,460
which is regarded as far as I can tell,
is one of the most potent

288
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,520
pro atheistic arguments that's ever been
sat down in literature.

289
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,000
I've been in low shower,
two of the brothers Karamozov handle.

290
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,850
Osha is a,
is a spiritual person.

291
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:33,760
He wants to be a monk and his brother 
Ivan is also,

292
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,620
I suppose the same sort of spirituality 
from the genetic perspective.

293
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,454
They are brothers after all,
but he's also extraordinarily 

294
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:40,884
intellectual and his intellectual 
ability has completely destroyed his 

295
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:45,054
ability to manifest the sort of faith 
that that characterizes Losha and so 

296
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,120
they're sitting down one time,
I believe they're both drunk.

297
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,900
I don't remember all those characters.
The SDS novelists are always drunk

298
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,150
and they have a very lengthy discussion 
about about

299
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,900
well,
about the central meaning of the world,

300
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,230
I guess,
and I haven't makes it very,

301
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,064
very powerful case and it's the case 
that it's sort of the worst case 

302
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,350
scenario.
He says,

303
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:15,184
look,
this is how the world is constituted by 

304
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:22,170
all approaches I can can see above if 
it's constituted in this way.

305
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,710
It's necessary to adopt the attitude of 
girth is Mephistopheles,

306
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,544
which is basically that the conditions 
of existence are so unbearable that 

307
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:33,090
existence,
that show itself has no justification.

308
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,380
It should cease to be

309
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,030
now under most conditions.
We don't draw that sort of conclusion,

310
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:39,864
but there are times,
especially when when our world's become 

311
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,600
much less secure than they normally are 
aware,

312
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,890
that sort of thing springs naturally the
mind and you know,

313
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,620
as long as things are going according to
plan,

314
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:51,454
we don't think like that,
but when the unexpected rises up and 

315
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,320
manifests itself in some extraordinarily
destructive way,

316
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,030
that's the first sort of notion that 
comes,

317
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,080
comes into our minds.
So I'm going to outline that argument.

318
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,770
This is from Jeffrey Burton,
Russell,

319
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,800
a for volume series on the devil in the 
water world.

320
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,153
He presents Ivan's argument for atheism.
Ivan's examples of evil are all taken 

321
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:27,780
from the data newspapers of 1876.
They're unforgettable.

322
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,123
There's a noble man who orders his 
hounds to tear a peasant boy to pieces 

323
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:32,544
in front of his mother,
a man who whips his struggling horse on 

324
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,193
generalized parents who lock their tiny 
daughter all night in a freezing privy 

325
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,303
while she knocks on the walls,
pleading for mercy at Turk who 

326
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,740
entertains a baby with a shiny pistol 
before blowing his brains out.

327
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,180
Okay.

328
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,473
I haven't noticed that such horrors 
occur daily and can be multiplied 

329
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:58,471
without an he states I took the case of 
children to make my case clearer

330
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,683
and so of course what he's doing is he's
presenting a situation where the 

331
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,110
innocent are tormented because that's 
that's an archetypal situation.

332
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:10,450
Fundamentally,
it's because in our typical situation is

333
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,284
where the most extreme situations that 
characterize any particular case on 

334
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,793
brought into the story.
So if you want to tell a very good 

335
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,340
story,
what you do is you make the extreme case

336
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,174
and that's what I was doing because how 
can you justify the suffering of 

337
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:28,030
innocence of the other tiers with which 
the earth is soaked?

338
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:28,864
I will say nothing.
We're also states the relation of evil 

339
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:36,790
to God has in the century of Auschwitz 
and Hiroshima once again became a center

340
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,250
of Philosophical and theological 
discussion.

341
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,070
The problem of evil.
It can be stated simply,

342
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,160
God is omnipotent.
God is perfectly good.

343
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,680
Such a God would not permit evil to 
exist,

344
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,540
but we observed that evil exists.

345
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,460
Therefore,
God does not exist.

346
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,753
You know,
I think it's absolutely necessary to 

347
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,490
realize that this,
this,

348
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,343
this,
this line of reasoning does not have to 

349
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:01,600
be formulated in a pure,
purely theological manner.

350
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,020
I mean whether or not you consider the 
conditions of existence generally as God

351
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:09,634
or as due to God,
has no relationship really necessarily 

352
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,390
on the attitude you bring to bear on the
conditions of existence,

353
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,420
whether you're an atheistic or religious
explicitly.

354
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,493
The same problem presents itself to you,
which is that things that are terrible 

355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,090
by any,
uh,

356
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,730
any manner in which terrible can be 
lead,

357
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,460
define,
constantly occur without apparent reason

358
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,600
and also without,
with,

359
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,970
without our ability to control them 
under such circumstances which evidently

360
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:40,804
exists.
Is it possible to pause it in any 

361
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:46,340
tangible manner that life is worth 
living

362
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,013
on?
That doesn't have to be a religious 

363
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:50,930
argument or expressed in religious 
terms.

364
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,880
Although at its core,
it's a religious.

365
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,240
The only religious argument really.
So the only question

366
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,750
variations on the theme or nearly 
infinite.

367
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:04,751
The problem is not only abstract and so 
of course he is also personalized.

368
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,590
Immediate believers tend to forget that 
God takes away everything that one cares

369
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,880
about possessions,
comfort,

370
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,370
success,
professional craft knowledge,

371
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,980
friends,
family and life.

372
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,783
What kind of God is this?
Any decent religion must face this 

373
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,960
question squarely and no answer is 
credible.

374
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,060
That cannot be given in the face of 
dying children.

375
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,880
Okay,
so that's the.

376
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,920
That's the argument there is setup for 
the worst case scenario

377
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,000
is this typical of Dostoyevsky's novels.
I mean that's.

378
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,883
That's what makes him a great novelist 
fundamentally is five great novels all 

379
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,580
address problems that are basically 
impossible.

380
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,370
The relationship of good evil and crime 
and punishment.

381
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,363
Yeah,
the relationship of divinity and 

382
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:54,440
individuality and the idiot,
the relationship of personal behavior to

383
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,300
social catastrophe in the devils

384
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,160
and the relationship between fathers and
sons.

385
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,293
That's part of it.
In the brothers Karamazov where this 

386
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:09,371
argument is also discussed,
what do you say to a dying child?

387
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,910
You say,
look,

388
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,510
you can do it.
You're strong enough to do it.

389
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,860
Hold her hand and fight the Safra and 
you can't control with the love that you

390
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:19,694
can't.
It seems to me that we use the horrors 

391
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,354
of the world to justify our own evil.
We make the presumption that human 

392
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,320
vulnerability is a sufficient cause of 
human cruelty.

393
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,933
We blamed God and God's creation for 
twisting and perverting our souls and 

394
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,670
claim all the time to be innocent 
victims of circumstance.

395
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I don't have much experience as a 
clinical psychologist to my patients,

396
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:44,444
however stayed in my mind.
The first was a woman about 35 years 

397
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:48,880
old.
She looked 50.

398
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,293
She reminded me of a medieval peasant,
least my conception of the medieval 

399
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,193
peasant.

400
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,970
She was dirty clothes,
hair,

401
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,923
teeth,
dirty with the kind of filth that takes 

402
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:04,880
months or even years to develop.
She was unbearably shy.

403
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,030
She approached anyone who she thought 
was superior in status to her,

404
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,163
which was basically everyone hunched 
over with is shaded by both hands as if 

405
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,590
she could not tolerate the light 
emanating from her target.

406
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,323
She been in behavioral treatment as an 
outpatient before and was a site known 

407
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:21,494
to the permanent staff at the clinic.
Others have tried to help her overcome 

408
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:26,700
her unfortunate manner of self 
presentation,

409
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,040
which of course many people on the 
street shy away from her,

410
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,810
made them regard her as crazy and 
unpredictable.

411
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,660
She could learn to stand or sit up 
temporarily with her eyes on garden,

412
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,040
but she reverted to her old habits as 
soon as she left the clinic.

413
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,653
She might've been intellectually 
impaired consequences of a biological 

414
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:45,210
fault.

415
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,210
It's difficult to tell because their 
environment was so appalling.

416
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,044
It may have caused or ignorance.
I thought perhaps that she had an Iq of 

417
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:52,764
about 80 or 85.
She was illiterate as well to live with 

418
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:56,934
her mother whose character I knew 
nothing about and with an elderly 

419
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:03,510
desperately ill and bedridden at her 
boyfriend was a violent schizophrenia,

420
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,403
alcoholic,
at least as far as I can determine who 

421
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:07,284
ms dot traded her psychologically and 
physically and was always modeling her 

422
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:12,860
simple mind with tirades about the devil
in the worship of sate.

423
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,800
She had nothing going for her.
No beauty,

424
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,230
no intelligence.
It will loving family.

425
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,120
Those skills,
no employer,

426
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,673
nothing.
She didn't come to therapy to resolve 

427
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,100
her problems.
However,

428
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,203
10 burden her solar to describe her 
mistreatment and victimization at the 

429
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:30,594
hands of others.
She came because she wanted to make 

430
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:34,170
friends with someone who was permanently
hospitalized.

431
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,683
The clinic where I was interning was 
associated with the largest psychiatric 

432
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,024
hospital.

433
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,193
All of the patients that still remained 
after the shift to community care and 

434
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:43,454
the sixties were so incapacitated that 
they could not survive on the streets 

435
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,123
on.
You've seen street people and Aaron cat 

436
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,013
incapacitated enough as a general rule,
so imagine how fascinated people who 

437
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:52,914
weren't allowed to go back on the 
streets where the basement of that 

438
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,544
hospital,
there was a coke room down in the 

439
00:27:59,041 --> 00:27:59,874
basement of the hospital.
The hospital was connected by tunnels 

440
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,933
all over the place.
I think product because it was so cold 

441
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,034
there.
It looked like a scene from Dante's 

442
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,184
inferno in that coke room.
I mean there were people in there that 

443
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:10,644
were so damaged.
It was just beyond beyond your capacity 

444
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,630
to imagine.
Anyway,

445
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:16,464
she'd done some volunteer work up some 
limited type in that hospital and 

446
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,200
decided that she could maybe take 
someone for a walk and make friends with

447
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,034
them.

448
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,960
I think she got the idea because she had
a dog when she walked regularly and when

449
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,540
she liked to take care of all she wanted
from me was helping,

450
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,374
arranging this,
help finding someone she could take 

451
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,850
outside,
help finding someone in the hospital,

452
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,010
bureaucracy who would allow this to 
happen.

453
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,580
I don't think I was very successful in 
80,

454
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,173
but she didn't really seem to mind
said that one piece of evidence that 

455
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,810
runs contrary to a theory is sufficient 
to prove that theory.

456
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,403
Just prove that theory.
Of course people don't think this way 

457
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,750
and perhaps should not general theories 
to useful to give up easily.

458
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,243
It's too difficult to regenerate and 
evidence again should be consistent and 

459
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,084
believable before it's accepted,
but the existence of this woman made me 

460
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:06,804
think
she was destined for a 

461
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:09,564
psychopathological and from the 
viewpoint of biological environmental 

462
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,680
determinism has faded.

463
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,513
This faded as surely as anyone I'd ever 
met and maybe she beat her dogs 

464
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:19,094
sometimes and was rude to her sick.
Maybe I didn't see her when she was 

465
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:23,574
vindictive or unpleasant.
Even when our simple wishes were 

466
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,123
thwarted.
Don't want to say that she was the same 

467
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,510
because I didn't know her well enough to
tell,

468
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,450
but the fact was that in her misery and 
simplicity,

469
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:34,284
she remained essentially without self 
pity and still able to see outside of 

470
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:37,914
herself.
I hesitate to say that I learned more 

471
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:42,550
from her than she did it for me because 
that sounds literary have tried,

472
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,630
but she didn't learn anything from me.
Why wasn't she a criminal,

473
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,980
cruel,
unbalanced,

474
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:50,050
and miserable.
She had every reason to be,

475
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,453
and yet she wasn't.
It seemed to me that in her simple way 

476
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:58,210
she'd made the proper choices.
She remained bloody but unbowed,

477
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,640
and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly,
to be a symbol of suffering.

478
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,470
Humanity solely affected,
yet capable of courage and love

479
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,560
such I created all the theory,
will powers and spirits both of them who

480
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:14,830
stood and fail and fail,
not free.

481
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,630
What proof could they have given sincere
of true legions,

482
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,590
constant faith or love.
We're only what they needs must do.

483
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:21,424
Appeared on what they would.
What praise could they receive a 

484
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:28,900
pleasure.
I from such obedience paid when will and

485
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,480
reason,
reason also his choice useless to me,

486
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,660
of freedom.
Both despoiled made passive,

487
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,510
both had served necessity,
not me.

488
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,383
They therefore as to right along so 
we're created or can justly accused 

489
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:44,734
there,
maker or they're making or their fate 

490
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,580
has it.
Predestination overruled.

491
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:52,460
There will dispose by absolute decree or
high for knowledge.

492
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,260
They themselves decreed their own 
report,

493
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,790
not I,
if I,

494
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,633
for new for knowledge,
had no influence on their fault which 

495
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:00,724
had no last group certain on Granola,
so with our so without least impulse or 

496
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,874
shadow of faith for by me,
immutably foreseeing a trespass authors 

497
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:14,410
to themselves in all both what they 
judge and what they choose for.

498
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,500
So I formed them free,
free.

499
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,820
They must remain until they enthralled 
themselves.

500
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,870
High else must change their nature and 
revoked the high decree,

501
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:25,900
unchangeable eternal which ordained 
their freedom.

502
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,270
They themselves are doing their fault.

503
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,303
That's God's discussion of the 
relationship between choice and evil in 

504
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,233
milk.

505
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,053
Have a patient I wished you described 
was the schizophrenia can falling 

506
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,010
inpatient ward had a different hospital.
He was about 29,

507
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:44,844
a few years older than me.
I've been in and out of confinement for 

508
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,260
seven years.
When I met him,

509
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,260
he was of course on anti psychotic 
medication,

510
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,320
participated in occupational therapy 
activities on the ward,

511
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,630
taking coasters and pencil holders and 
so on,

512
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,360
but he couldn't maintain his attention 
for any length of time.

513
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,473
It wasn't even much good at craft.
My supervisor asked me to administer an 

514
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:07,940
intelligence test to him.
Standard wastes are more for the sake of

515
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:10,340
my experience.
Then for any possible diagnostic good at

516
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:11,174
my deal.
I gave him a dozen or so red and white 

517
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:14,054
blocks for the block design test.
He's supposed to arrange the blocks so 

518
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:20,120
they matched the pattern printed on the 
cars that came with the test,

519
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,133
pick them up and started to rearrange 
them on the desk in front of them are 

520
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,450
like timed them stupidly with a 
stopwatch.

521
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,973
Task was impossible for him,
even at the simplest of stages to 

522
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,080
constantly look distracted and 
frustrated.

523
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,900
I asked what's wrong?
He said,

524
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,840
battle between good and evil.
That's going on in my head.

525
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,360
I start the testing.
At that point.

526
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,673
I didn't know exactly what to make of.
His comment was obviously celebrate the 

527
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,280
testing seemed to make it worse.
What was he experiencing?

528
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,800
Wasn't lying,
that's for sure.

529
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,520
The face of such a statement,
it seemed ridiculous to continue.

530
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,650
Spent some time with him that summer.
I never met anybody who was so blatantly

531
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:03,680
or we talked on the ward and 
occasionally I would take him for a walk

532
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,514
through the hospital grounds outside.
He was the third side of first 

533
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:11,120
generation Middle Eastern immigrants.
His first born brother was a lawyer.

534
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,260
The other physician,
his parents were obviously ambitious for

535
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,050
their children,
hardworking and discipline.

536
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,303
Being a graduate student at Mcgill,
working towards a master's degree in 

537
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:22,214
immunology.

538
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,630
I don't remember exactly.
His brothers had said daunting example,

539
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,780
and he felt pressured to succeed,
has experimented work at,

540
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,460
not turned out as he had expected.
However,

541
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,590
any apparently came to believe that he 
might not graduate,

542
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,843
not at least when you hope to,
so he faked his experimental results in 

543
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,330
wrote up his thesis.
Anyways,

544
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,700
he told me that the 90 finished reading,
he woke up and saw the devil standing at

545
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:44,534
the foot of his bed and this event 
trigger the onset of his mental illness 

546
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,000
from which he had never recovered.
Of course,

547
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,283
it might be said that the apparition 
merely accompanied the expression of 

548
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,074
some stress induced pathological 
neurological development whose 

549
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:57,614
appearance was biologically 
predetermined and that the devil was a 

550
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:03,260
personification of his culture.
His conception of moral evil manifesting

551
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:05,840
itself in fantasy as a consequence of 
his distress.

552
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,750
Such description would remain accurate 
implausible,

553
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,303
but the fact remains that as a person he
saw the devil and the division 

554
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,650
accompanied or was the event that 
destroyed him.

555
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,510
He was afraid to tell me much of his 
fantasy.

556
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,344
You very well developed fantasy world 
and it was only after I'd paid careful 

557
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,630
attention to him that he opened up.
He wasn't bragging.

558
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,270
We're trying to impress me.
He didn't want to tell me this.

559
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,450
It was terrified about what he thought.
He was terrified as a consequence of the

560
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,400
fantasies that impressed themselves upon
him.

561
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,330
He told me that he couldn't leave the 
hospital because someone wanted to shoot

562
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:40,380
him.
I said,

563
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:43,380
typical paranoid delusion.
Why did someone wanted to kill him?

564
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,640
Well,
he's hospitalized during the Cold War on

565
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,474
its height,
perhaps still during the time when the 

566
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:53,520
threat of purposeful nuclear 
annihilation seem more plausible than it

567
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:54,354
does now.
Many of the people I knew used this 

568
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:57,654
threat,
the existence of this threat to justify 

569
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,204
to themselves their failure to 
participate fully in life life which 

570
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:05,610
they thought of Romantically as do and 
therefore it's pointless,

571
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,223
but there was some real terror in this 
pose and the thought of countless 

572
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:11,370
missiles pointed here and there around 
the world,

573
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:12,204
sap,
the energy and faith of everyone 

574
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,783
hypocritical or not,
my schizophrenia patient believed that 

575
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:20,370
he was in fact the incarnation of the 
world in our lady force.

576
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,260
He was arrested upon his release from 
the hospital to make his way south who's

577
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,140
in Canada to a nuclear missile silo and 
American territory,

578
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,050
and to make the fateful decision that 
would launch the Third World War,

579
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,493
the people outside the hospital,
and that is why they were waiting to 

580
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:36,684
shoot him.
They didn't want to tell me this story 

581
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,860
because he thought that I might want to 
kill him to

582
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,510
my friends in graduate school.
I thought it was quite comical.

583
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,450
Denied contact a patient like this one,
peculiar interest in human and humans,

584
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,160
ideas regarding the collective 
unconscious.

585
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:50,994
We're well known to them that seemed 
absurdly fitting that I would end up 

586
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,720
talking to someone with deletions of 
this type,

587
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,090
but I didn't know what to do with his 
ideas.

588
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,720
Of course they were crazy,
my patient,

589
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,440
but it still seemed to me that they were
true from a metaphorical viewpoint.

590
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,910
Historian totality.
Length is individual choice between good

591
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:11,040
and evil,
with a cumulative horror than facing the

592
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:11,874
world.
Historic implied that because he had 

593
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,150
given into temptation at a critical 
juncture,

594
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,780
he was in fact responsible for the 
horror of the potential of nuclear war.

595
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,573
How could this be?
Seemed insane to me to even consider 

596
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:23,874
that the active one,
powerless individual can be linked in 

597
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,300
some manner.
That time of history as a whole,

598
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,270
no longer so sure.
I've read much about evil,

599
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,933
perpetration and growth,
and I no longer convinced that each of 

600
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:36,754
us are so innocent or harmless.
It is of course a logical to presume 

601
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:40,744
that one person,
one speck of dust among the 4 billion 

602
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,320
modes is there any sense responsible for
the horrible course of human events,

603
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,590
but that course itself is not logical 
far from it,

604
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,520
and it seems likely that it depends on 
processes that we do not understand.

605
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,753
Jeffrey Burton,
Russell argues in his work on the 

606
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:00,304
history of the concept of the devil,
that the classic distinction drawn 

607
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,650
between Natural Evil and moral evil is 
untenable.

608
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,730
It'll currencies such as plagues and 
earthquakes belong in the same category.

609
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:14,731
Companies dance as concentration camps 
on wards the existence of natural evil,

610
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,790
for which God is theoretically 
responsible,

611
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,400
has been used as evidence for the most 
potent arguments for the nonexistence of

612
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,263
God.
Say you put the nonexistence of any 

613
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:29,350
meaning such as I outlined previously.
That was the states.

614
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,040
Perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a
single innocent child suffering.

615
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,090
How can the universe be constructed so 
that pain is permitted?

616
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,450
How can a good God allow for the 
existence of a suffering world?

617
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,960
It seems reasonable to me to draw a 
distinction between tragedy and tragedy,

618
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:52,830
has an ennobling aspect,
at least influential has been constantly

619
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:55,050
explored it to that and great literature
and mythology.

620
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,230
Tragedy exists where the heroic 
encounters limitation,

621
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,360
evil by contrast is anything but no more
participation in Alex whose sole purpose

622
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,310
is expansion of medicine,
pain and suffering destroys character,

623
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,190
forthright encounter with tragedy might 
increase it.

624
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,800
This is the meaning of the symbol of the
crucifixion.

625
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,713
It's Christ full participation in freely
chosen acceptance of his fate which he 

626
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:19,344
shares with everyone that enables him to
manifest his full identity with God and 

627
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,743
it's that identity which enables him to 
bear that fate and which strips over 

628
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,293
evil.
And conversely it is our voluntary 

629
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:34,050
demeaning of our own characters which 
makes the necessary tragic conditions of

630
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:35,200
existence of pure evil.

631
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,003
Where did these conditions exist?
Why are we sending to unbearable 

632
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,234
limitation to paying disease and death 
and cruelty at the hands of nature and 

633
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:47,404
society?
It seems to me that it is because of 

634
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:54,901
game cannot be played without rules.
God and man are in a sense twins,

635
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,133
so there's a mid rush and this means the
God made man because he lacked 

636
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,693
limitation.
We could have everything we wanted 

637
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:07,030
merely for wishing it.
If every tool performed every job,

638
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,870
if everyone was omniscient and immortal 
and everything would be the same,

639
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,130
same old powerful thing,
God and creation wouldn't exist.

640
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,323
It is the differences between things 
which is a function of their specific 

641
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:23,770
limitations that allows them to exist at
all should they be.

642
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,640
It seems to me that we answered this 
question implicitly,

643
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:30,730
but profoundly.
When we lose someone loved and grieve,

644
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,643
grieve presupposes.
Having love presupposes the judgment 

645
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,903
that this person specific,
bounded and vulnerable existence was 

646
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,400
valuable,
was something that should have been.

647
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,770
Let's do it.
Question lingers,

648
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,740
why you shouldn't.
Things even loved things exist at all if

649
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:50,350
they're necessarily limitations caused 
such suffering.

650
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,953
I dreamed I was walking out of a deep 
valley along the paved two lane highway 

651
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,853
highway was located in northern Alberta 
where I grew up and came out of the 

652
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,543
valley for miles around and then the 
sleep flat prairie asked the man 

653
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,220
hitchhiking could see another in the 
distance.

654
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,273
As I approached him,
I could see that he was in the first 

655
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:12,710
stages of old age,
but he looked terribly strong.

656
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:13,963
Someone passed them in a car driving the
opposite direction and a female voice 

657
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,720
yelled out,
look,

658
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:18,554
he has a knife.
He was carrying what looked like a 

659
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,510
wooden handle kitchen knife,
well worn and discolored,

660
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,000
and it had a blade at least two and a 
half feet long.

661
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,210
Cross the shoulder strap,
the large leather sheath.

662
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
He was walking along the edge of the 
highway,

663
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,353
muttering to himself,
had swinging the leg jerky and chaotic 

664
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:35,564
fashion.
He looked like the landlord lived next 

665
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:40,850
door to me when I was a graduate student
living in a poor district in Montreal.

666
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,760
My landlord was a powerful aging x 
biker,

667
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,210
former president of the local hell's 
angels chapter by his own account.

668
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,910
He spent some time in prison as a 
younger man.

669
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,893
He's settled down somewhat typically as 
he became more mature and had brought 

670
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:56,600
his drinking under control for a time.
His wife committed suicide.

671
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:57,434
However,
when I lived there and he went back to 

672
00:40:58,771 --> 00:40:59,690
him as well,
your ways,

673
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,550
he often went on binge drinking sprees 
and spent all the money he earned in the

674
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,810
electronic shop.
You ran out of a small apartment.

675
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,973
He would drink 40 or even $50 in a 
single day and would return home in the 

676
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:11,330
evening.
Blind drunk,

677
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,710
howling,
knows little dawn,

678
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,870
laughing,
kissing between his teeth,

679
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,390
incoherent,
good natured still,

680
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,000
but able to become violent at the 
slightest provocation,

681
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,100
took me once to his favorite haunts and 
slightly better condition on his 1200 cc

682
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:25,934
Honda,
which had the acceleration of a jet 

683
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,160
plane for short distances.

684
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,100
We perched precariously on the back of 
his bike,

685
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,840
clinging to him,
wearing his wife's,

686
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,260
which settled my head ridiculously as it
was at least five sizes too small drunk.

687
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:42,230
He was almost in a singly destructive 
and ended up in fights constantly,

688
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,980
unavoidably because he wouldn't take 
slights from people whose paths crossed,

689
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,220
who were insufficiently cautious in that
conversation with him.

690
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,103
I heard by this figure he seemed upset 
that no one would stop and pick them up 

691
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,970
as if he were unaware of the dangers 
posed.

692
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,450
As I went by.
His gaze fell on me and he started after

693
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,120
me,
not from anger or for desire,

694
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,350
for companionship,
I think,

695
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,440
but he was too unpredictable for me.
He wasn't fast.

696
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,300
However,
I stayed ahead of him on the road.

697
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,770
Scene shifted and I wielding figure 
nine.

698
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,820
We're now on opposite sides of a huge 
tree.

699
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,013
Perhaps 100 years,
100 yards in diameter on a spiral 

700
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:18,590
staircase,
wander around,

701
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,510
wound around the tree,
out of the depths below,

702
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,390
into the heights above the staircase was
made out of old,

703
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:24,350
worn dark wood.

704
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,553
Reminded me of the church pews in the 
church I attended with my mother as a 

705
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:30,620
child where I was married.
His figure was looking for me.

706
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,100
He's a long way back and I hit myself 
from this view

707
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,123
as I send them the staircase.
I remember wanting to continue in my 

708
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:39,944
original journey out of the valley.
One of the flats around the plane with 

709
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:43,514
the walking would be easy,
but the only way to stay away from the 

710
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:49,580
knife was to continue up the staircase 
up the axis Mundi.

711
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,120
That's awareness of death.
The grim reaper,

712
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,283
terrible face of God compels us 
inexorably upward towards the 

713
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:58,844
consciousness,
sufficiently heightened to bear the 

714
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:00,824
thought.

715
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,330
The point of our limitations is not 
suffering.

716
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,793
It's existence.
Excel point of evil by contrast is 

717
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:13,910
conscious destruction,
manifest desire for increase of pain,

718
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,053
anxiety and suffering.
We've been granted the capacity to 

719
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,860
voluntarily bear the terrible weight of 
our mortality,

720
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,253
returned from that capacity and degrade 
ourselves because we're afraid of 

721
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,084
responsibility.
That's the necessarily tragic 

722
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,830
preconditions of existence are 
intolerable.

723
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,493
Perhaps we could reserve answer to the 
question of God's nature is 

724
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:38,420
responsibility for the presence of the 
evil and creation.

725
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,430
Until we have solved the problem of our 
own,

726
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,953
perhaps we could tolerate the horrors of
the world if we left our characters in 

727
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:45,524
intact and develop them to the fullest,
we took full advantage of every gift 

728
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:49,454
we've been granted.
Perhaps the world would not look 

729
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:55,070
horrible that it seems to me that it's 
not the earthquake,

730
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,800
a flood or the cancer that makes life 
intolerable,

731
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,963
horrible.
As those events appear who seemed 

732
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:02,750
capable of withstanding natural 
disaster,

733
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,290
even if responding to that disaster in 
an honorable and decent manner,

734
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,083
it is instead the pointless suffering 
that we inflict upon each other that 

735
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:12,500
makes life appear corrupt beyond 
acceptability,

736
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,570
and that undermines our ability to 
manifest,

737
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,413
save faith in our central nature that 
makes us work even more diligently for 

738
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,170
the destruction of everything that lives
and breathes.

739
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,433
It said,
be therefore perfect as your father in 

740
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:27,494
heaven is perfect.
How seems stymied has always by as 

741
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,610
pilots are running query.
What is truth?

742
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,200
Well,
even if we don't know precisely what the

743
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,360
truth is,
we can certainly tell each of us what it

744
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,203
isn't.
It isn't greed and the desire above all 

745
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,340
else for constant material game,
it doesn't denial.

746
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,193
I've experienced,
we know full well to be real and the 

747
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,970
infliction of pain for the purpose of 
pain,

748
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,530
it appears possible to stop doing those 
things which we know beyond doubt,

749
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:59,364
to be wrong and to become self 
disciplined and honest and maybe 

750
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:06,310
therefore to become able to perceive the
nature of the positive group

751
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,113
maturity seems painfully simple,
so simple that it's a miracle of sorts 

752
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:16,290
that can ever be forgotten.
Love God with all thy mind and all I and

753
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:20,670
all that heart sort of truth above all 
and treat your fellow man as if you were

754
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:23,580
yourself.
Not with a pity that undermines his self

755
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,240
respect and not with a justice that 
elevates yourself above you,

756
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,980
but as it corrupted divinity,
a light to the center,

757
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:32,190
it's more difficult to rule oneself in 
the city.

758
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,263
And this isn't a metaphor.
This is truth as literal as it can be 

759
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,534
made.
It is precisely for this reason that 

760
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:41,570
we're always trying to rule.
The city is a perversion of pride.

761
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:42,404
To see praying in public and uh,
clean up the dust under our feet and 

762
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,393
staff seems too mundane to treat those 
we actually faced with respect and 

763
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,960
dignity when we can be active against in
the street.

764
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,550
Maybe it's more important to strengthen 
our characters that to repair the world.

765
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,590
So much of that reputation seemed self.
Channing is selfishness and intellectual

766
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:02,424
pride masquerading as well.
Creating a world polluted with good 

767
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:05,604
works

768
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,793
don't work

769
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:11,663
who couldn't believe that it is the 
little choices that we make everyday 

770
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,033
between good and evil,
but turn the world to waste and hope to 

771
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:16,494
despair,
but it is the case we see are immense 

772
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:20,304
capacity for evil,
constantly realize before us and great 

773
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:25,800
things and then small,
I can never seem to realize our infinite

774
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:29,220
capacity for good can argue with the 
soldiers.

775
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,850
And when he states one man who stops 
lying can bring tyranny.

776
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,810
Christ said,
the Kingdom of Heaven is spread out,

777
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,300
spread out upon the earth,
but men do not see it.

778
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,003
What if this were in fact the case?
What if it was nothing but our self 

779
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:44,880
deceit,
cowardice,

780
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,550
hatred and fear of polluted our 
experience?

781
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,384
And turn the world into hell hypothesis 
at least at least as good as any other 

782
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,480
admirable and capable of generating.
Why can't we make the experiment?

783
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Find out if it is true.
I want to read you something else.

784
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:16,700
Now.
This is.

785
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,843
This is another.
This is a description of the dream that 

786
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:26,391
I collected from my nephew.
I'll read you the story about it because

787
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:28,530
it's related to

788
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,200
the experiment that I was just 
describing,

789
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,670
right

790
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,600
hypothesis that I was trying to generate
in that chapter was that,

791
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,063
hmm,

792
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,573
look,
if you're treating someone in 

793
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:43,284
psychotherapy for an anxiety disorder,
which basically means treating them 

794
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:50,670
because they're too afraid to continue 
living their life in the way that it has

795
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:55,671
to be lived even for it to continue it.
It appears beyond reasonable doubt.

796
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,190
Now that
attempting to convince the person of the

797
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:03,024
unreality of their fear or of the 
unreality of the category of things to 

798
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:10,140
be afraid of is not useful.
Don't people do not respond to that?

799
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,280
You can't talk someone out of their 
neurotic beliefs.

800
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,973
All you can do is help them learn to 
confront those things that terrify them 

801
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,960
and then perhaps what they learned is 
that they can confront those things,

802
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,893
terrify them.
They don't learn that the thing itself 

803
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:27,054
is any less terrifying,
but they seem to learn that their own 

804
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,460
conception of themselves with so 
pathologically limited this,

805
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:35,943
that it was that conception that was in 
fact leading to their to their 

806
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,424
discomfort because the neurotic person 
who runs from everything that he or she 

807
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,624
is afraid of is possibly to themselves.
Whatever it is that they are in essence 

808
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:51,790
is something so trivial that it can 
stand up to negative emotion and prevail

809
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,833
and in therapy what you do is structure 
the situation so that the person can 

810
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:58,780
learn as a consequence of their own 
experience,

811
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,570
not a consequence of the therapists 
words.

812
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,990
Then if they're brave enough to look at 
what they can tolerate,

813
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:05,824
looking at the devil in fact get better.
And the thing that's so interesting 

814
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,394
about that,
and it's mysterious even from the 

815
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:11,734
standard psychoanalytic viewpoint,
is that when you do so when you do that 

816
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:15,064
to someone,
their ability to withstand fear 

817
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,184
generalizes,
which means that if you teach them to 

818
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:23,050
withstand fear in one situation,
then they're better at doing it in other

819
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:26,230
situations and their fear,
even if it's symbolic underneath,

820
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,610
doesn't multiply everywhere.

821
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,320
That you haven't exposed them.
So they may also get more confident,

822
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:34,530
for example,
in their interpersonal relationships and

823
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:35,364
that.
So that's a very common contaminant of 

824
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:39,010
exposure therapy for agoraphobic women,
for example.

825
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:39,844
Then they start standing up to their 
husbands because of course prior to 

826
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:42,994
that,
their husbands were categorized in the 

827
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:45,274
category of all those things that are 
too terrible to face and what the 

828
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:48,964
therapist is teaching the client.
Even if the therapist doesn't know it 

829
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:54,100
explicitly,
is that you are the sort of creature who

830
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:54,934
is capable of standing off to the 
category of all things that are too 

831
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:59,770
terrible to face.
And all you have to do is give it a shot

832
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,270
for awhile.
Which is basically.

833
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,673
Which is to say basically that you have 
to manifest some behavioral faith in 

834
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:06,694
yourself and you can discover that all 
by yourself and that's as far as I can 

835
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,174
tell and I've looked at different 
personality theories and different 

836
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:15,820
theories of psychotherapy and me.
They tend to boil down to the same thing

837
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:20,380
in some way.
That same thing is that,

838
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,380
well,
first of all,

839
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,170
you need a coherent theory about what 
things are about and second of all,

840
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:28,100
that exposure to the things that

841
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,210
frightened you,
cures you.

842
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,150
There's a now chemical dictum that 
according to you and was the primary all

843
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:42,400
chemical dictum in steer clear linear 
inventory.

844
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,650
I hope that's pronounced right,
but my Latin isn't any good.

845
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,050
The translation for that is it is found 
incest pools and that was the El Kevin.

846
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:56,240
That was the alchemists general theory 
about where the philosopher's stone list

847
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,074
to be found and the philosopher's stone 
was a material substance in theory that 

848
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,070
possess the power to grantee turtle 
life,

849
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:08,020
but also to bring about eternal health 
and you and.

850
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,230
Well,
in other words,

851
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,850
it was a thing that would.
Granted,

852
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:11,684
they're all the wishes and the chemical 
notion when you can find this thing 

853
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:21,980
where no one will look and what that 
also means from the personal perspective

854
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:25,490
is where you will look well,
that's a strange notion,

855
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:26,324
but it's a bit more comprehensible if 
you start to think about it from the 

856
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,624
psychological perspective rather than 
from the empirical perspective because 

857
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:33,074
you could say,
well,

858
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,950
even though the places that we won't 
look differ from person to person,

859
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,090
from the perspective of a natural 
category,

860
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:42,924
it might be reasonable to pause it.
That that place where one will not look 

861
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,200
is similar in some sense across 
individuals,

862
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,203
which is only to say that all of us have
those particular things that we're 

863
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,060
afraid of facing and the particular is 
different,

864
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,470
but the fact that those things exist is 
standard across people.

865
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,300
King Arthur is night sitting around 
table because they're all equal.

866
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,613
They set off to look for the holy grail,
which is a symbol of salvation 

867
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,550
symbolically container of the nourishing
blood of Christ,

868
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,510
which is another reference to 
sacrificial symbolism,

869
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,763
keeper of redemption.
Each night leaves on his quest 

870
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:27,670
individually.
Each night enters the forest to begin to

871
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:29,730
search at the point it looks darkest to 
him.

872
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,350
When I was about halfway through reading
this manuscript,

873
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,270
I went to visit my sister in law and her
family.

874
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,660
She had a son,
my nephew who's about five years old.

875
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,913
It's very verbal and intelligent.
He was deeply immersed in a pretend 

876
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:48,370
world and like to dress up as a night 
with a plastic helmet and sword

877
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,873
Martech.
He was happy during the day to all 

878
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:56,940
appearances,
but didn't sleep well at night,

879
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,040
had been having nightmares for some 
time.

880
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,143
He regularly screened for his mom in the
middle of his rest and appeared quite 

881
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:04,560
agitated by what was going on in his 
nightmares.

882
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,250
This was a daily occurrence,
essentially enough so that the household

883
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,710
was being disrupted
or house.

884
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,950
One morning after woken up,
what he dreamed about,

885
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,593
he told me in the presence of his family
that dwarf like beat creatures who came 

886
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,520
up to his knees,
have been jumping,

887
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,883
jumping up at him and biting him.
Interesting was just looking through 

888
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,130
some

889
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
mythological imagery on the weekend and 
I found out that that while there is 

890
00:53:31,191 --> 00:53:35,160
some archeological notions and don't 
know how valid they are,

891
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:35,994
that there was a point in European 
history where worship of the mother 

892
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:40,494
goddess was very widespread and the 
cultures that performed this worship 

893
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:47,430
word then overrun by patriarchal 
cultures later and patriarchal religions

894
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:49,170
replaced these early matriarchal 
religions.

895
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,453
I don't know the
similar theories to that like bio 

896
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:55,823
conference theory that human race was 
once matriarchal and then was later 

897
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:04,491
patriarchal have been discredited in the
past and I'm not so sure that this isn't

898
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:08,400
just a projection of mythological 
structure onto history,

899
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:11,310
which happens very often,
but it doesn't matter.

900
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:12,144
There are,
there are doesn't matter to this 

901
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:15,150
discussion,
although it matters.

902
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,183
Many of these.
There are very many ancient images of 

903
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,660
goddess figures.
We've looked at some of them and I found

904
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,494
out this week and that many of them are 
figures of their fingers off the 

905
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:28,980
combination of a woman's body without 
burden.

906
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,010
Sometimes the figure has wings,
sometimes it has a beat had.

907
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:34,643
It's quite interesting.
I guess this would be an example of 

908
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:40,860
synchronicity because I've been thinking
about this.

909
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,020
I just saw the movie crumb.
Have any.

910
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:46,290
Have you seen that David Lynch,
you should all see that by the way,

911
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:47,124
because it's first of all,
it's very interesting study of of an 

912
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:53,100
extraordinarily pathological family,
three brothers,

913
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,263
one who molests women,
his bum in the streets of San Francisco 

914
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,680
who also sits on beds of nails and it 
has a very ascetic attitude.

915
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,440
Another man,
50 years old,

916
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,333
never left home,
never slept with any women depressed 

917
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:10,440
since he was 20.
Multiple suicidal finding,

918
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,274
kills himself a year after the movies 
made and this other brother named crumb 

919
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:15,324
who's a famous underground cartoonist 
who produces a lot of the images while 

920
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:23,100
he perceives himself in relation to a 
ship to women in general as a small,

921
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,173
thin outcast,
sort of figured who tends to clean the 

922
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,194
back of very large,
powerful looking women who by the way 

923
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:33,510
often have bird heads,
which I found very interesting.

924
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,673
Anyways,
these figures that popped up in my 

925
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,410
nephew,
his dreams,

926
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,710
these dwarf like beat creatures.
Where were these sorts of,

927
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,443
are this archaic sort of image 
representing the source of all things 

928
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:47,491
and while you say,
well,

929
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,324
why would it beeped goddess be a good 
representation for the source of all 

930
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:51,480
things?
Well,

931
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,313
it has something to do with the notion.
There's a whole bunch of notions 

932
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:57,570
compiled all together that one is the 
wild birds.

933
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,463
They fly.
So there's spiritual creatures because 

934
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,524
they're associated with the air and the 
sky and so they have a masculine aspect 

935
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,260
like the whole,
like it goes to,

936
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:08,610
for example,
in a masculine aspect.

937
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,590
And the goddess of course is more a more
down to earth bakers.

938
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,170
So these figures represent the union of 
opposites,

939
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:19,660
just like the dragon of chaos,
which is a serpent with wings anyway.

940
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,870
So that's what pops up in this 
particular dream.

941
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,190
So anyways,

942
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,810
he told me in the presence of his 
family,

943
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:27,850
the door,
like creatures

944
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,680
who came up to his knees had been 
jumping up at him and biting him.

945
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,083
Each preacher was covered with hair and 
Greece that had a cross shaved and the 

946
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:37,774
hair on the top of his head.
The dream also featured a dragon who 

947
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:41,404
breathed fire after the dragon exhaled,
the fire turned into these dwarves who 

948
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:47,860
multiplied endlessly with each breath.
Oh,

949
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:48,694
that was a great image too.
He told the dream in a very serious 

950
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:54,470
voice to his parents and to my wife and 
I,

951
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,480
and we were shocked by it.
Same Ingredient,

952
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:57,343
horror.
It was really interesting to watch him 

953
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:02,530
because
he,

954
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,671
while I,
like I said,

955
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,800
he was always reading around this little
night outfit anyway,

956
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:06,634
so he's in this world.
Whatever it was composed of is very 

957
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,184
imaginative,
but then as soon as we asked them about 

958
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:11,704
the dream,
I mean he just launched into it without 

959
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:13,564
a pause where you could almost.
It was almost as if you could see the 

960
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,234
imagery running in his head and he just 
told the story with no with no 

961
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:19,690
hesitation whatsoever.

962
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,960
And well,
the other thing,

963
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,690
I guess that was what made so 
interesting to watch him was,

964
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:28,630
was that his attention moved from 
outside world in and we're,

965
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,493
all of us were obviously inside because 
he wasn't focusing on anything when he 

966
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:34,870
was telling the story.
He's just letting the imagery run.

967
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,650
Anyways,
the dream occurred at a transition point

968
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:39,484
in his life.
He was leaving his mother to go to 

969
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:44,230
kindergarten and was joining the social 
world.

970
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,600
The Dragon,
of course,

971
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,710
served as a source of fear itself for 
the unknown.

972
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:52,000
In general,
there are a burroughs,

973
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,450
while the doors were individual things 
to be afraid of.

974
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,660
So you see the mythological imagery with
dragon of chaos,

975
00:57:58,661 --> 00:57:59,494
the grease fires standing in the back of
everything and it produces these things 

976
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,510
that have this Artek,
matriarchal nature,

977
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:07,650
which is the unknown as it actually 
manifests itself and experience,

978
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,050
and so there's this eternal source and 
as it breathes fire,

979
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,010
particular things that frightened,
frightened him would pop up.

980
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:15,843
And the thing that I thought so 
interesting is there is hydro mythology 

981
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:21,510
and a two because hydro of course is 
multi headed dragon.

982
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:22,344
He kind of had me like seven more grow 
all basically all that's a pretty 

983
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:26,694
accurate representation of the way life 
progress is under some conditions 

984
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:30,984
because every time you solve a problem,
some other problem pops up somewhere 

985
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,670
else.
Or sometimes when you solve a problem,

986
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,683
the solution that you use to solve the 
problem generates a whole bunch of new 

987
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:39,624
problems and the hydro mythology is 
basically just a representation of the 

988
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:47,880
idea that no matter how much time he's 
running around putting out fires,

989
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,820
new fires keep popping up all over and 
that's.

990
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:51,743
That will always be the case.
It's also a representation of the fact 

991
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:55,644
that a political utopia that's conceived
of as a permanent state is impossible 

992
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,633
because when you generate a solution,
the solution to these problems and 

993
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:04,134
there's no way you can stop that partly 
because the solution does far more 

994
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:10,740
things than you would like it to do.
Which is why,

995
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:13,530
for example,
drugs have so called side effects.

996
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,350
I mean you have a problem,
you applied to drug to it.

997
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,180
The drug produces all sorts of other 
problems.

998
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,610
I mean hopefully that are smaller than 
the original problem,

999
00:59:20,611 --> 00:59:25,040
but sometimes knows maybe there are 
bigger and it still remains to be seen,

1000
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,874
for example,
where their television has solved more 

1001
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:30,290
progress in his creative mind.
Yes is the reverse,

1002
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:33,770
but whatever the point is,
things do all sorts of things.

1003
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,210
Other than what you think they'll do,
like

1004
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,283
anyways,
I asked him why he could do about this 

1005
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,374
dragon.
He said immediately I would take my dad 

1006
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:46,324
and we'd go after the dragon jumped on 
his head and I poke out at size with my 

1007
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,970
sword.
Then I go down its throat where the fire

1008
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:52,804
came out.
I cut the box out that the fire came 

1009
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,080
from and make a shield from it without 
really.

1010
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,430
I mean not really blew me away.
I couldn't believe that he could.

1011
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,820
I mean the idea of going,
first of all,

1012
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,170
he blinded the dragon,
which I thought was very interesting,

1013
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:09,040
but then he went down his throat.
I mean not steps showed you that video.

1014
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:10,300
Right?
And they go inside the whale.

1015
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,530
I mean that's exactly,
exactly.

1016
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,660
Do you have a dream?
But then there was a twist of brilliance

1017
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:21,040
in this dream because he said that the 
thing to do was to take the box that the

1018
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:21,874
fire came from,
which was the source of the unknown 

1019
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:24,514
itself and transform it into something 
that he could actually use against the 

1020
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:28,804
unknown.

1021
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,640
That idea is so brilliant that it's.
It's a.

1022
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,553
it's a miracle of sorts that it can be 
reproduced in the dream of a five year 

1023
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:35,734
old because what it says is that what 
what is necessarily used to go to where 

1024
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:39,454
fear itself resides without knowing 
itself resides to identify with that 

1025
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,870
thing and to use it as a defense against
the unknown itself,

1026
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,183
which is exactly what we do all the time
when we adapt to the fact that there 

1027
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,970
isn't a milling,
which is to say that when something I've

1028
01:00:54,971 --> 01:00:55,804
known occurs,
which means when some new information 

1029
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:00,640
pops up because the two things are 
precisely equivalent.

1030
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:05,260
It's as a consequence of exploring that 
new information that you generate,

1031
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:08,650
new things that you can use to further 
the process of adaptation.

1032
01:01:08,651 --> 01:01:09,311
So you say,
well,

1033
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:12,340
the unknown is the source of all the 
problems.

1034
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,593
We know that,
but it's also the source of all the 

1035
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:15,964
answers to the problems and it is the 
case that while we use nature against 

1036
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:21,730
nature,
so to speak,

1037
01:01:21,731 --> 01:01:25,450
to to quote an ancient source that I can
remember.

1038
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,850
That's the process of constructing 
culture,

1039
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,410
is we use the material world to defend 
ourselves against the material world.

1040
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,740
And hopefully the balance remains on our
side.

1041
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,930
He had reproved preproduced,
an archaic hero myth in perfect form.

1042
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,873
I thought the use of making a shield 
from the firebox or thought the idea of 

1043
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:49,380
maintenance shield from the firebox was 
brilliant.

1044
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,580
This gave him the strength of the dragon
to use against the dragging

1045
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,043
his nightmares ended at that point and 
did not return even though he had been 

1046
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,990
suffering from them almost every night 
for a number of months.

1047
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,333
I asked his mother about his treatments 
more than a year later and she reported 

1048
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:07,140
no further disturbance.
Of course,

1049
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,900
many of you are going to find that hard 
to believe that that's true.

1050
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:10,734
That's actually what had occurred or you
saying the thing is he was having this 

1051
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:15,600
problem,
obviously,

1052
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:19,110
whatever it was,
it was plaguing him in his nightmares,

1053
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,060
whatever those composed of whatever 
those were composed of.

1054
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,153
He was running around like a night 
trying to act out the solution or you 

1055
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:31,290
didn't quite have it.
He was using his behavior in ritualistic

1056
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:35,160
forum to address a problem about 
adaptation which he couldn't manage,

1057
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,413
but as soon as he made the dream 
explicit and then came up with a 

1058
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:40,140
solution,
problem disappeared.

1059
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,030
The little boy guided by his 
imagination,

1060
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,660
adopted identification with the hero 
faced his worst nightmare.

1061
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,480
If we're to survive individually and 
socially,

1062
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:55,750
each of us must do the same
trick.

1063
01:02:55,850 --> 01:03:00,850
Wiliness inventor in film will be found.
This is the prime alchemical victim.

1064
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,900
What do you need most is always to be 
found where you least wish to look.

1065
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,393
It's not a mythological statement.
It's the only recognition of the fact 

1066
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:10,564
that in order to adapt to ongoing 
experiences necessary to make use of 

1067
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:15,784
every experience that you've had and 
it's only those experiences that you 

1068
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:19,714
haven't made use of,
that you determined are too terrifying 

1069
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,720
to contemplate,
and then as a logical consequences,

1070
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:25,554
it's necessarily the case that all of 
those things that you're allowed to 

1071
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:30,220
state classified as too terrible to 
contemplate,

1072
01:03:30,221 --> 01:03:31,054
do in fact contain all that information 
that you need to survive because it is 

1073
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:35,550
their locked.

1074
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,660
It's the.
It's their lack of use.

1075
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,793
That has actually resulted in you 
constructing a personality that's too 

1076
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:45,970
trivial to to withstand the full weight 
of your experience.

1077
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,500
You know,
if something's bugging you,

1078
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,470
you know,
it's like let's say you have,

1079
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,840
you have a situation with your parents 
that's never been resolved.

1080
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:57,210
It's like bugging you for who knows some
people that things like that funding for

1081
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:58,044
like decades without ever facing the 
reason it's bugging us because that's a 

1082
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:05,710
little chunk of the unknown that your 
limbic system has detected so to speak,

1083
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,420
and it's always popping it up saying,
look,

1084
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,020
look,
look,

1085
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,310
look,
look.

1086
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,900
Here's some information you're not 
paying attention to.

1087
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:13,973
Well,
I don't want to pay attention to it 

1088
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:16,060
because it makes me anxious.
Well,

1089
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,170
he asked.
It makes them anxious.

1090
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:18,004
That's how.
That's the form that new information 

1091
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:21,010
always takes,
right?

1092
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:23,770
That's how it interests into your 
consciousness to begin with as something

1093
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:24,760
that makes you anxious.

1094
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,833
Of course you have any number of reasons
to move away from it since it makes you 

1095
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:28,954
anxious,
but the problem is if you keep doing 

1096
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,110
that,
then you don't make use of all the.

1097
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,020
All the novel experience on the question
is,

1098
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:35,854
well,
why would you move away from it instead 

1099
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:38,860
of facing it?
Well,

1100
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:39,694
the answer to that is obviously because 
you don't think that you're capable of 

1101
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,653
facing it,
which is to say that you've defined 

1102
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,220
yourself in opposition to this thing 
which is intolerable,

1103
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,233
and the definition that you use is that 
I am too insignificant or weak or 

1104
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:53,734
whatever,
inconsequential consequential or unable 

1105
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:56,733
to face this aspect of my experience,
which I know by my own rules actually 

1106
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,464
exists.

1107
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:04,873
No

1108
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,780
anomalous information brings terror and 
possibility,

1109
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:15,220
revolution and transformation,
rejection of an unbearable facts stifles

1110
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:17,050
adaptation and strangles life.

1111
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,510
There was a good man who owned the 
vineyard.

1112
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,130
He leased it to tenant farmers so that 
they might work at.

1113
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,830
Then he might collect the produce from 
them.

1114
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:28,813
He sends his servant so the tenants 
might be having the proper use of the 

1115
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:34,230
vineyard bases to serve and beat him all
week.

1116
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,100
Telling him serving.
Went back and told his master.

1117
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,710
The master said perhaps they didn't 
recognize him.

1118
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,010
He sends another servant.
Tenants beat this one as well.

1119
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:46,910
Then no one has said his son and said 
perhaps they will show respect to my son

1120
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,980
because of the tenants knew that it was 
he who was heir to the vineyard.

1121
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:55,700
They seized him and killed him,
but him who has ears hear Christ said,

1122
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,640
show me the stone which the builders 
have rejected that.

1123
01:05:58,641 --> 01:05:59,690
We'll use the cornerstone.

1124
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:03,300
Thank
you.

1125
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,730
Great.
That particular story,

1126
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:10,380
as one of the sources for the notion of 
the philosopher's stone says,

1127
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:13,030
show me the stone which the builders 
have rejected that.

1128
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:15,860
What is the cornerstone?
Oh,

1129
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,320
it's a complicated story.

1130
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,710
Was he in the Jewish temple?
The quarter stone was the stone that had

1131
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:28,100
the perfect dimensions with all of 
stones are based on that.

1132
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,283
Right?
Right.

1133
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,900
Jesus as the savior,
Messiah,

1134
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,780
and he is the one that.

1135
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:35,950
Well,
that's.

1136
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:36,783
I would say that's a yes.
That's part of the symbolic structure 

1137
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:46,680
that surrounds the idea.
The story in a sense has more.

1138
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,573
It has a more

1139
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,300
straightforward interpretation in a way.
I mean all of it.

1140
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,610
The moral of that story means is two 
things.

1141
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:56,280
One is then whatever it is you reject is
the thing that you need.

1142
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,950
That's the first thing.
It doesn't matter what it is,

1143
01:06:58,951 --> 01:06:59,784
it's just the fact is that you have to 
make use of all the things that present 

1144
01:07:02,221 --> 01:07:06,030
themselves to you whether or not you 
find the map actively tolerable.

1145
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,980
Now we already know that you determined 
what,

1146
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,113
what's an effective tolerable as a 
consequence of the value structure that 

1147
01:07:12,151 --> 01:07:13,050
you were raped,
right?

1148
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:17,730
You're always analyzing phenomena in 
reference to the goals that you perceive

1149
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,564
as valid,
so whether something is actively 

1150
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,081
tolerable,
no,

1151
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:21,914
it depends to an immense degree on your 
interpretation of what's important and 

1152
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:29,430
it's maybe the case that certain things 
to you appear intolerable because you're

1153
01:07:29,431 --> 01:07:32,940
unwilling to give up a value structure 
that's really pathological.

1154
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:33,923
If you gave up the value structure,
the thing we looked unbearable wouldn't 

1155
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:36,684
be unbearable at all.
It might be positive so you can switch 

1156
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:39,534
the valence and things very rapidly by 
just transforming the thing that you 

1157
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:43,030
believe it.
Well,

1158
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:43,903
we already know that certain forms of 
anomalous information have the capacity 

1159
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:51,720
to completely overthrow the philosophies
that you use to evaluate events.

1160
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,520
What about the first part of that story 
or the other story there?

1161
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:58,960
That seems a little bizarre.
I don't quite see that they are one.

1162
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,460
Well,
why is that idea of the story is saying,

1163
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:04,294
well,
these two events are precisely the same 

1164
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:10,090
is that if you define yourself as that 
creature,

1165
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:15,091
which is unable to accommodate two or 
assimilate negative events,

1166
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,263
you've Ah,
you've abandoned your identification 

1167
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,460
with the hero.
That's what that means.

1168
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,413
What did the individual characters 
symbolizing the story about the 

1169
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:26,750
vineyard?
They symbolize?

1170
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,423
Well,
that's what I was trying to get at with 

1171
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,460
them with that.
Well,

1172
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,320
the owner of the vineyard symbolizes 
God.

1173
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,423
Okay.
Now the story is trying to represent is 

1174
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:39,350
the idea that sacrifice of identity with
the hero,

1175
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,700
which is equivalent to this death 
internally is equivalent to rejection of

1176
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:47,390
the novelist information.
That's what it means because it's.

1177
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,583
This is the thing that I've been trying 
to lay out describing the relationship 

1178
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:55,070
between the process that's represented 
by Satan's Milton Satan.

1179
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,633
There's no difference between saying 
this thing is to to intolerable to face 

1180
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,500
and saying,
I am too little deface it.

1181
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,513
Those are exactly the same thing.
So removing yourself away from 

1182
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:15,530
information that you regard as to 
threatened to tolerate is identical to a

1183
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,720
destruction of identification with the 
hero.

1184
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,330
So why the two services?

1185
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,780
First,
we're wondering what are the.

1186
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,990
What?
What's that from?

1187
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,410
Yeah,
I,

1188
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,740
I don't know.
I don't know actually what route.

1189
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,583
Maybe.

1190
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,740
What's
that?

1191
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:39,890
Well,
yeah.

1192
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,723
Yeah.
I guess what I guess what those figures 

1193
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:46,010
represent his approximations to the hero
that which,

1194
01:09:46,011 --> 01:09:48,440
which would fit perfectly well and into 
the,

1195
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,930
into the interpretation that they were 
prophets.

1196
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,233
I mean,
you know what they like to hear hero 

1197
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,860
even less,
right?

1198
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:55,694
Right.
They weren't too thrilled with people 

1199
01:09:56,301 --> 01:10:00,930
who approximated the hero precisely.
And so that will.

1200
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,920
That's exactly the case.
I mean it's a rare.

1201
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,793
It's referenced to the fact that people 
tend to devour people in groups tend to 

1202
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:10,100
devour those individuals upon which the 
group actually depends.

1203
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,730
And what this story is pointing out,
I guess,

1204
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:14,564
is that that would even be the case if 
they figured that constituted the 

1205
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:19,203
archetypical individual upon whom the 
group depends appeared how people would 

1206
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,890
still be motivated to do precisely the 
same thing.

1207
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,383
So.

1208
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,933
Okay,
well then the next thing which I really 

1209
01:10:35,551 --> 01:10:37,320
don't have time to go into in much 
detail,

1210
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,780
so you have to read this,
but this will give you some,

1211
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:43,140
some intimation of at least what was 
going on and know.

1212
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:44,910
Look,
I've been,

1213
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,790
while it's been my position 
fundamentally,

1214
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:51,660
that people have paid an insufficient 
amount of attention to use writings.

1215
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,280
Well,
they're confusing,

1216
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,173
that's for sure.
I give some reasons why that might be 

1217
01:10:56,161 --> 01:11:00,000
the case in the manuscript.
Most of his students were women.

1218
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,010
Most of them were outside of the 
academic tradition.

1219
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,383
He discussed religious imagery to a 
large degree in psychology tends to shy 

1220
01:11:06,481 --> 01:11:10,170
away from any religious imagery because 
it's very young scientists and it's just

1221
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:15,171
dissociated itself from philosophy.
It's dominated by materialistic way more

1222
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:17,970
materialists in psychology than there 
are in physics for example.

1223
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,763
There's all sorts of reasons.
It's certainly the case with youngs 

1224
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:25,440
early writings,
but it's even more dramatically the case

1225
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:26,274
with his later writings and all his 
later writings deal with alchemy and 

1226
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:31,650
nobody's been able to figure out what 
the hell he was talking about.

1227
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,640
Why spend all this time trying to 
decipher these l chemical writings,

1228
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,240
but what was the trying?
What was young was trying to

1229
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,520
outline was the symbolic representations
of the internal process that occurs when

1230
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:55,410
people do precisely what my nephew in 
this dream said that he should do,

1231
01:11:55,830 --> 01:12:00,830
which is to say
what are the consequences of.

1232
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,020
You can put it all sorts of different 
ways.

1233
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:09,260
What are the consequences of admission 
of error or what are the consequences of

1234
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:10,254
identification with Harold?
Or what are the consequences of the 

1235
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:16,230
adoption of a stance of religious 
humility?

1236
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:17,363
Because all those things piled together 
and actually constitute the same 

1237
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:21,540
phenomena.
And what you said was,

1238
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:22,374
well,

1239
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,003
it's possible for people to undergo 
revolutions in their cognitive 

1240
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,700
structures.
We know that from Thomas Kuhn much later

1241
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:32,534
by the way,
so this is not only true for empirical 

1242
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,820
structures,
but also for moral structures so we know

1243
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:38,654
that's the case and people have updated 
their views of the world over and over 

1244
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:42,044
and what.
What you was trying to point out was 

1245
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:47,540
that this could actually happen within 
an individual and not only that it could

1246
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:48,374
happen,
but that it had happened many times in 

1247
01:12:49,821 --> 01:12:50,654
the past and there was symbolic 
representations of all the stages of 

1248
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:53,954
this particular process and most of them
are going to be pretty familiar to you 

1249
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:57,614
already because I'd be trying to make 
reference to them all the time in the 

1250
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:04,280
diagrams that I've been using you and 
basically stated that there were 45

1251
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,493
sequences of events
frequently intermingled in terms of the 

1252
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:15,360
narrative structure that characterized 
the alchemy,

1253
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,513
some more the alchemist trying to do 
while they were people who possessed by 

1254
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:23,910
an intimation of the insufficiency of 
the churches.

1255
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:25,030
Rick,
Rick,

1256
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,800
a representation of reality followed 
their notion that there was still valued

1257
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:36,950
to be apprehended in the interpretation 
and discovery of matter.

1258
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:39,613
The alchemists were the first scientists
in a service knowing from the empirical 

1259
01:13:42,931 --> 01:13:46,920
perspective because they didn't have an 
experimental method method methodology,

1260
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,443
but from the standpoint of interest 
because they were the first people who 

1261
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:51,874
were willing to pause it.
That in this huge domain that had 

1262
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:57,240
essentially been outlawed as heretical 
by the church,

1263
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,550
something of interest still might be 
there to be found.

1264
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,291
He said,
well look,

1265
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,340
you know,
the Church says,

1266
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,860
as a consequence of these historical 
events,

1267
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:08,310
humanity is being redeemed.
The alchemists,

1268
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,630
you might say,
looked around and said,

1269
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,650
well,
if this redemption taking place,

1270
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:15,010
things are still in pretty sad shape,
so maybe there's something more going on

1271
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:15,190
here.

1272
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,360
Then we might that might meet the eye.
All they become interested in.

1273
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,053
So you want you almost trying to do is 
to explain why it was that we developed 

1274
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,670
science,
especially why developed in Europe.

1275
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,143
So what,
what were the historical precedence to 

1276
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:32,674
the explosion of science in the last 500
years following the reasonably logical 

1277
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,284
hypothesis that something of that 
magnitude was likely prepared by us at 

1278
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:46,030
least several centuries of previous 
thought rather than just like coming out

1279
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:48,710
of nowhere all of a sudden and only in 
one culture so.

1280
01:14:48,711 --> 01:14:49,544
Well,
the first thing that preceded the 

1281
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:55,330
development of science was the notion 
that the pursuit of

1282
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,560
knowledge about material might in fact 
be valuable.

1283
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,380
So that's the hypothesis,
test the hypothesis,

1284
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,243
the abundant life science is that if you
investigated the transformations of the 

1285
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,044
material world,
you might find some information of 

1286
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:11,170
value.
You said,

1287
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:13,330
well,
this first popped up in the form of what

1288
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:15,850
might be regarded as a kind of cultural 
dream,

1289
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,100
and the dream was the dream of the 
philosopher stone,

1290
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:18,934
which was that there was a material 
substance that if you only possessed it 

1291
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:24,790
with grandpa and of your wishes,
and you can say,

1292
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,670
well,
what is it that motivates science?

1293
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,673
This is why you thought that science was
still embedded in the mythological 

1294
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:30,844
format.
I said,

1295
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:35,980
that's what motivates us at the border.
We're convinced that if we can just find

1296
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:36,843
out enough about the way things are made
that we won't have to get old anymore 

1297
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:41,584
and we won't have to get sick anymore 
and there'll be enough for everyone and 

1298
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,353
all that seems like a perfectly 
reasonable hypothesis as far as I can 

1299
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:52,771
tell me
anyways.

1300
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,690
He tried out.
Now,

1301
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,610
the other thing that you pointed out,
however,

1302
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,250
and this is I suppose where the argument
gets very,

1303
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,480
very complicated,
is that

1304
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:07,030
what the outcome is set out to 
investigate was not matter as we can see

1305
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:07,864
that because they didn't know what 
matter was as we can see that they 

1306
01:16:10,851 --> 01:16:11,684
didn't even have way of representing it.
Blacking entirely an empirical 

1307
01:16:14,181 --> 01:16:15,014
methodology for what they were actually 
out to explorer was the unknown part of 

1308
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:21,920
which was mattered in the material 
world.

1309
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:26,660
As from the from the medieval 
perspective and young basically made the

1310
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:31,661
point that what the outcome was did was 
posited that the notions of the church,

1311
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:35,930
which is the group identity basically 
we're not complained,

1312
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,880
were insufficient.
Which is to say that you

1313
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,670
positive that the alchemist was someone 
who was willing to admit to him,

1314
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:44,983
to himself that the manner in which the 
world had been interpreted was not 

1315
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,333
complaint.
Which is to say that there was still 

1316
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:52,940
something left.
So you could say,

1317
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,690
well,
he.

1318
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,523
He regarded himself as something that 
was still ignorant and also the church 

1319
01:16:58,011 --> 01:16:58,844
community,
which was essentially totalitarian was 

1320
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,600
too military infrastructure is could be 
imagined,

1321
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,390
was nonetheless incomplete,
and you said,

1322
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:06,224
well,
it was merely the process of that 

1323
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:10,910
preset,
which is I don't know everything.

1324
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,743
Maybe there's still something left to 
explore necessarily produced and our 

1325
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:15,964
identity of the alchemist with the hero,
even though they didn't know what I 

1326
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,034
mean,
that because what they were doing was 

1327
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:22,470
acting out the role of the hero and you 
can say,

1328
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,301
well,
whenever you do that,

1329
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,134
certain things happen and those things 
are expressed to no chemical symbolism 

1330
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,670
and what happens when you drop the role 
of the hero,

1331
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:29,743
but were you already know that it's like
there's a mission that unknown 

1332
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:35,390
information exists.
The information comes in.

1333
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:39,130
It blows the structure of your previous 
worldview.

1334
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,173
He descended into a a situation that's 
characterized by emotional chaos as a 

1335
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,910
consequence of processes that occur in 
that state of chaos.

1336
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,100
There's a reconstruction of a new world 
view,

1337
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,033
but how is that represented?
Now can be the first stage is we're 

1338
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,540
represented either by the prime of 
material or the descent of the king.

1339
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,553
Now you guys should know enough about 
symbolism to start to understand what 

1340
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,441
this means.
He said,

1341
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:06,500
well,
what happens to you when you first admit

1342
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:09,770
that something that meant everything to 
you might not be complete?

1343
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:10,071
He said,
well,

1344
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:12,590
that can be represented as two ways,
depending in two ways,

1345
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:13,424
depending on what stage of the process 
you need to be represented by the depth 

1346
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:21,851
of the cake or by your identity with 
what was called in Alchemy,

1347
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:24,920
the primary material,
which is basically chaos,

1348
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,350
the dragon of chaos,
and you can say,

1349
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:28,760
well,
those two things are the same.

1350
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:32,120
Why pause?
Because of the descent of the king,

1351
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,620
the descendant of King and beyond your 
world,

1352
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:35,750
or the death of the king or the 
distillation of became.

1353
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,943
Remember the alchemists.
They were trying to explain things like 

1354
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,840
why matter would dissolve saying salt 
water and mercury.

1355
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:47,880
So it's a weird mixture of empirical 
speculation and metaphysical theorizing.

1356
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:51,140
You remember the alchemist didn't have 
any scientific techniques,

1357
01:18:51,141 --> 01:18:54,440
so all they could do when they were 
manipulating material,

1358
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,543
the material world,
which was demonic like church 

1359
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,240
association,
was used,

1360
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:02,400
their fantasies and what were their 
fantasies full of last mythologies,

1361
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:05,060
Christian mythology.
That was their worldview fundamentally.

1362
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:06,800
So of course that's all they saw.
Everything.

1363
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,730
It's all they knew.

1364
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,380
That's the dragon of chaos,
the prime of material,

1365
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:14,240
the source of all things.
Well,

1366
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,523
in the medieval view,
the primary material was not just 

1367
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:18,524
something material.
It was much more akin to these 

1368
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:20,984
mythological notions of the dragon that 
we've discussed because the outcome is 

1369
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:26,810
set well.
Whatever the world comes from is a weird

1370
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:31,160
intermingling of all those things that 
will eventually become society,

1371
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,353
the individual soul and matter,
which is I think an unbelievably 

1372
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:40,340
sophisticated perspective because,
well,

1373
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:42,140
that's something you'll have to think 
about on your own,

1374
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:42,974
but it is the case that whatever the 
source of all things is is that thing 

1375
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:51,170
which in time turns into the subject and
an object plus society at large.

1376
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:56,150
Now we tend to think of that something,
that thing as something purely material,

1377
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:56,984
but that's because we make the 
presupposition that whatever we are a 

1378
01:19:58,991 --> 01:19:59,824
subject is something that's reducing to 
whatever is through the material and I 

1379
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,730
would say,
well that might be true,

1380
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:08,700
but if it is the case that whatever we 
are is reducible to something material,

1381
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,080
by the time we figured you figured out 
how that relationship exists,

1382
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,513
the way we interpret matter will be 
completely different from the way we 

1383
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:19,020
interpreted now and that's.

1384
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:19,883
That's one.
That's one thing that really argues 

1385
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:22,734
against a simple minded material.
Reductionism is the presupposition that 

1386
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,800
you understand the phenomena to which 
you're reducing everything,

1387
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:33,510
which you know clearly.
Anyways,

1388
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:37,140
all these stages,
there are descriptions of this process.

1389
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:52,783
The key,

1390
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,073
the death of the king produces 
immersement and chaos that was also 

1391
01:20:58,171 --> 01:21:01,530
described as the Nigredo,
which is an interesting stage.

1392
01:21:01,531 --> 01:21:04,560
It's often represented in an alchemical 
symbolism,

1393
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:05,394
has a.
An old man who was black who was very 

1394
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:08,304
close to death,
sitting in a pit like breathing out of 

1395
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,730
the Raven.
It's symbol.

1396
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,760
It's symbolic of anxiety and depression.
Fundamentally more than that.

1397
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,490
Also emotional chaos and all you one was
trying to point out in this analysis,

1398
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:23,460
so our committee,
what is the.

1399
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,983
If you lose a moral philosophy,
your emotions become dysregulated and 

1400
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:30,420
you're swamped with anxiety and 
depression.

1401
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:34,290
The outcome is regarded that as a state 
in this process of transformation.

1402
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:35,124
Not as a final statement necessarily,
but it's the kind of thing that needs 

1403
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:37,884
she's describing when he talks about 
standing at the edge of the cliff and 

1404
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,840
looking off into the abyss.
Well,

1405
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:42,750
that's the UBS.

1406
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,610
The chaos is represented by on the 
dragon also by the queen of chaos.

1407
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:52,590
That's.
That was my representation anyways.

1408
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:53,640
I said,
well,

1409
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,273
the notion here was the
thing that was to be dissolved in the 

1410
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:04,730
salt solvent.
The king and chaos can be represented as

1411
01:22:04,731 --> 01:22:05,680
a Kenyan,
a queen,

1412
01:22:05,681 --> 01:22:06,514
the queen sorting,
making reference to the sort of 

1413
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:11,850
matriarchal symbolism that we've talked 
about the past and that was the union of

1414
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:12,684
those two things that would produce a 
new structure and that's an idea that's 

1415
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,300
very much like the old Egyptian idea of,
well,

1416
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:19,134
cirrus going into the underworld or or 
the idea of the Egyptians have that the 

1417
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:28,920
Egyptian Pharaoh was simultaneously the 
old dead Pharaoh and the new federal,

1418
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:30,323
which is to say that
if you have a particular philosophical 

1419
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:34,914
viewpoint,
which is the manner in which you would 

1420
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:36,894
describe an aspect of value to your 
environment and it dissolves all things 

1421
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:42,354
that you had classified are no longer 
classifiable and you're swamped as a 

1422
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:46,314
consequence.

1423
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,543
Swamp with anxiety and depression,
which are two of emotional phenomena 

1424
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,730
that that whole classification system 
wasn't directed to inhabit.

1425
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,840
To begin with.
When that system blows itself apart,

1426
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:58,674
those emotions come back up.
And and how do you construct a new 

1427
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:01,974
system?
Well,

1428
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:06,920
you use the anomalous information that's
blowing your old system apart,

1429
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,390
plus everything that you had known 
before to erect something new.

1430
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:11,224
And the outcome is symbolized by the 
Union of the king border and the Queen 

1431
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:15,910
of chaos,
sexual union,

1432
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,063
something that notion that makes 
illusion to incest symbolism and their 

1433
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:22,834
offspring.
The divine son was the new state of 

1434
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:27,760
order on the outcome associated that 
with

1435
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:36,130
with the philosopher's stone.
Everything,

1436
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:38,863
either a permanent state of order or a 
permanent state of redemption or the 

1437
01:23:43,161 --> 01:23:43,994
process that gives rise to that when she
was the aspect that we're more 

1438
01:23:46,761 --> 01:23:51,761
interested in.
I'm sorry.

1439
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:54,070
That's too much to bring that discussion
to make,

1440
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,340
to do justice to you,
his ideas,

1441
01:23:56,350 --> 01:24:00,280
but they can't really be summarized 
rapidly.

1442
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:02,563
Okay.

1443
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:15,010
I just ask you one thing that's always 
interested me is there it is.

1444
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,730
The Union of opposites
essentially given the context,

1445
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,560
the context of the theory of this class,
I take the union of opposites to me,

1446
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:28,660
sort of a creative type of stable 
hierarchy of goals.

1447
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,353
Yes,

1448
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,850
but those goals are essentially a 
separate things in competition.

1449
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,130
I mean if they're not,
if they're not organized or

1450
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,430
effects often,
why?

1451
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,293
Why did it?
You characterize it as a union of 

1452
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,313
opposites because the fact that they're 
in competition doesn't necessarily mean 

1453
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:49,840
that there isn't a structure where you 
have exactly one opposed to another.

1454
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,133
What did he mean?
Did he get that out of you got that out 

1455
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,010
of symbolism I guess,
but at the same time,

1456
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,720
why isn't it represented more in terms 
of sort of chaotic competition for other

1457
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,780
than that?
In terms of the.

1458
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:05,363
That's a good question.
What I think it's mostly because he 

1459
01:25:07,591 --> 01:25:08,424
viewed the competition of.
It's more from the perspective of the 

1460
01:25:10,621 --> 01:25:11,454
mythological structures that we've 
discussed where things are held in 

1461
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:14,214
opposite the positive aspect of the,
of the creative unknown at the negative 

1462
01:25:18,151 --> 01:25:20,250
aspect,
the positive aspect of the known and the

1463
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:21,084
negative and there's clearly a structure
of opposites there and if you what if 

1464
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:25,444
you take the biological perspective that
what young is referring to is the 

1465
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:32,820
integration of different effects driven 
philosophies in a sense.

1466
01:25:32,821 --> 01:25:37,680
Then the notion that they're in 
opposition breaks down to some degree.

1467
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,140
There's still a certain amount of.
Would you say was that Kurt,

1468
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:42,983
to to guess that they were represented 
that way simply because that's an easy 

1469
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:48,600
way to,
to review conflicting things is in terms

1470
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,330
of a simple up opposition.

1471
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:56,563
I mean if you're gonna spend more than 
that too though because like let's say 

1472
01:25:59,691 --> 01:26:00,524
that

1473
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,093
let's say that
the two things you want in a given 

1474
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:09,950
situation,
conflict with one another,

1475
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,160
so that means you value one thing and 
you value.

1476
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:15,470
Now you're in love with someone they 
don't like your job.

1477
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,143
Alright?
So those are two affectively driven 

1478
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,073
philosophies in a sense,
structures of value that are brought 

1479
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,080
into conflict as a consequence of a new 
situation.

1480
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,183
In those situations,
those forces would war and opposition 

1481
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,203
and that's part of the reason why this 
has always represented as opposing 

1482
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:38,390
forces mean you don't have a conflict 
until you have a conflict of duty.

1483
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,613
You have a conflict of duty.
When one thing you think is important 

1484
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:42,764
and valuable and morally appropriate 
conflicts very powerfully with another 

1485
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:48,800
thing that you think is valuable and 
morally inappropriate.

1486
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,190
Then you're caught in the war,
torn apart by these two.

1487
01:26:52,191 --> 01:26:53,024
Flow down.
One of the things you and was trying to 

1488
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:56,960
point out was that your a structure 
evaluation,

1489
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:57,823
the fact that you love this person,
the fact that you valued this job are 

1490
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:01,304
structures that have developed as a 
consequence of an incredibly lengthy 

1491
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:07,100
historical process and even the notion 
of love,

1492
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:11,120
although it might be rooted in certain 
biological predispositions,

1493
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:15,050
is a cultural construct that's developed
over thousands and thousands of years.

1494
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:15,883
That's,
that's fed in part for example by the 

1495
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:19,210
notions of,
uh,

1496
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,453
what's the medieval notion?
Central many medieval notion of 

1497
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,170
gallantry chivalry,
right?

1498
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,350
I mean love is the construction and 
part.

1499
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,223
Why do you.
Why are you so attracted to your job in 

1500
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:36,530
that particular circumstance?
Well,

1501
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:40,760
it's very complicated job as being 
described values as a consequence of all

1502
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:41,594
sorts of processes.
It's your way of holding anxiety and 

1503
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:45,194
depression at bay had they.
It's part of the way that you described 

1504
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:51,620
determinant meaning to the world.
It's part of a larger social structure.

1505
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,200
When you put those forces in opposition 
in a given circumstance or when they can

1506
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:57,034
flip in a given circumstance,
you're torn apart as a consequence of 

1507
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:02,180
their conflict that makes you the pawn 
of the gods,

1508
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:05,980
so to speak.
What you was trying to describe in his l

1509
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,853
chemical sequences is the process by 
which all these conflicting hierarchies 

1510
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:15,320
of value could be brought into one 
internally.

1511
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,700
Coherent story.
My story he was trying to represent,

1512
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,460
he said,
well,

1513
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,293
by the end of the chemical period,
the more psychologically sophisticated 

1514
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:25,363
alchemists were drawing an analogy 
between whatever the hell the 

1515
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:31,050
philosopher's stone was in Christ,
which is very peculiar thing.

1516
01:28:31,051 --> 01:28:31,884
So as they had more or less left the 
church in order to pursue this process 

1517
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,870
to begin with,
and what does that mean?

1518
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,213
Well,
the philosopher's stone was the thing 

1519
01:28:39,741 --> 01:28:40,574
that represented that thing that's of 
ultimate value and in Christian 

1520
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:45,560
mythology that's also love Christ 
represent.

1521
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:46,394
So it's not very surprising that they 
would end up falling into the same 

1522
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,400
category,
so to speak,

1523
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:50,234
because it was the existence of that 
category that gave rise to both those 

1524
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:55,010
concrete examples.
Anyways.

1525
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,150
Well,
the question is,

1526
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,103
what the hell does this represent what 
we're trying to get at painful even dot 

1527
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:03,000
last lecture?
Well,

1528
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,673
we know already that this process might 
be regarded as the continual process by 

1529
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:16,230
which particular answers to the 
philosophical question,

1530
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:20,610
what is the good or generates like,
here's one philosophical Schema,

1531
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,000
new information,
what was it?

1532
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,050
The part it's replaced by another one 
that's theoretically more complete.

1533
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:28,470
New information comes in and blows it 
apart and so on and so forth.

1534
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,920
Always never ending says,
well,

1535
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:34,830
how do you get out of 12?
We sent over months ago.

1536
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:35,664
Look,
you pop out of identification with any 

1537
01:29:37,741 --> 01:29:38,574
of the states which is adolescent 
identification with an ideology anyways 

1538
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:43,554
under all circumstances,
and you start to identify with the 

1539
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:46,914
process which is the process of 
voluntary encountered with the unknown 

1540
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,400
descent into this chaotic state and 
reconstruction says,

1541
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,243
well,
the only have two modes of protection 

1542
01:29:57,301 --> 01:30:01,470
against a known one is identification 
with a particular system of beliefs.

1543
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,453
The other is identification with the 
process by which chaos itself can be 

1544
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:07,920
transformed in order.
Do you have a saying,

1545
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:09,430
well,
this constant,

1546
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,373
and this is represented various in 
various ways and mythology sometimes as 

1547
01:30:13,861 --> 01:30:18,090
the philosopher's stone sometime as the 
figure of a given prophet like Moses,

1548
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:20,250
sometimes it's price,
sometimes it's Buddha,

1549
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:21,443
what is supposed to represent his 
identification with the process of 

1550
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,670
adaptation and not the outcome.

1551
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:27,953
You said
what's your youngest concerned with is 

1552
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:33,960
the hierarchical structuring of value 
systems.

1553
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,120
That's what do you mean by the Union of 
opposites?

1554
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:37,320
Well,
but you said was,

1555
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,183
look,
there's only one answer to the problem 

1556
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:41,123
of what's more important than what else,
which is to say there's only one answer 

1557
01:30:45,211 --> 01:30:48,900
in a sense to the problem of how value 
should be hierarchically organized,

1558
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,973
and his answer was essentially the thing
that's at the pyramid of the hierarchy 

1559
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:56,544
of values should be the process by which
the whole hierarchy is constructed and 

1560
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:02,640
that means everything should be 
subordinate to it.

1561
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,380
So when you read,
for example,

1562
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:09,150
in the new testament notions that say 
it's more difficult for a rich man to.

1563
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,403
It's easier for a rich man to go through
the eye of a needle than to enter into 

1564
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:13,014
the Kingdom of heaven.
What the story means is if you think 

1565
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:19,740
that security,
which means how do I deal with death,

1566
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,050
how do I deal with the Old Lady,
how do I deal with sickness,

1567
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,620
can be found.
If you think that money,

1568
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:26,783
material possessions for that matter can
provide you with the kind of security 

1569
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:30,294
that you want,
which is security in the face of all 

1570
01:31:31,351 --> 01:31:33,810
those terrible things.
You're wrong because it won't work,

1571
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,950
and furthermore,
if you put the desire for money,

1572
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:41,340
which is security basically,
above all else,

1573
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,353
you'll sacrifice necessarily sacrifice 
identification with the only process 

1574
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,190
that could in the final analysis offer 
for you,

1575
01:31:48,191 --> 01:31:49,560
the kind of protection that you're 
needing.

1576
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,180
So it's not going to work.

1577
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,711
Well.
First of all,

1578
01:31:53,711 --> 01:31:57,970
this is.
There's an assumption here that order is

1579
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:59,410
a good thing.
That's,

1580
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:00,820
you know,
that's what you're.

1581
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,410
Well,
there's an assumption here,

1582
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,013
right?

1583
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,543
That's,
that's the problem with these states is 

1584
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:10,540
that is the assumption orders.
Good chaos isn't.

1585
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,600
That's wrong,

1586
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,830
right?
I see.

1587
01:32:12,831 --> 01:32:13,664
Okay.
So then you get to that point and what 

1588
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,810
an unresolved issue I have.
Is that okay?

1589
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:18,703
If you placed yourself with the ultimate
goal of the identification with the 

1590
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,050
process,
well,

1591
01:32:24,051 --> 01:32:26,160
I don't see how,
if you,

1592
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:27,210
um,
you know,

1593
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:28,183
actively moved towards the unknown,
look into that which we are all capable 

1594
01:32:32,691 --> 01:32:35,000
of.
So I see I am capable of evil,

1595
01:32:35,001 --> 01:32:39,620
I am capable of killing someone.
I am capable of,

1596
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,510
you know,
all these things.

1597
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,520
Well,
what,

1598
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:47,930
how does that fit into that?
How does that fit into that framework?

1599
01:32:47,931 --> 01:32:48,150
So

1600
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:48,983
well,
tell me more to expand your notion of 

1601
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,430
what it is that you are and also perhaps
bring up the capabilities that you would

1602
01:32:56,431 --> 01:32:57,264
be unwilling to use or even unwilling to
admit to at times in situations where 

1603
01:33:01,411 --> 01:33:03,600
they might be appropriate.
Like it isn't until,

1604
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,493
for example,
it may be that in order to survive 

1605
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:08,220
optimally,
whatever that means,

1606
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:12,120
that you might have to have access to a 
whole realm of aggressive impulses.

1607
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,690
The existence of which you're not even 
willing to admit.

1608
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:16,711
So we say,
well,

1609
01:33:16,711 --> 01:33:20,280
if you can actually come to grips with 
the fact that your behavioral capacities

1610
01:33:20,281 --> 01:33:23,400
are much broader on the negative side 
than you might have on the negative side

1611
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:24,263
as you define it,
then you might have never been willing 

1612
01:33:25,951 --> 01:33:26,784
to admit and you can also start to 
understand that you may have 

1613
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:32,280
capabilities that you have not even 
begun to explore,

1614
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,343
and it's certainly the case that all,
although aggression can be used in all 

1615
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:37,470
sorts of ways that appear clearly 
negative,

1616
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,573
that there's any number of situations 
where the capacity to maintain your 

1617
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:42,774
ground or even to move forward in the 
face of tremendous opposition is 

1618
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,490
absolutely necessary to you.

1619
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,950
So that would be.
That would be one part of the excel.

1620
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,770
It's also the case that until you're 
capable,

1621
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:53,723
have at least conceiving conceptually of
how significant the errors that you're 

1622
01:33:57,691 --> 01:33:58,524
making might be.
You haven't got a hope in hell of doing 

1623
01:34:00,181 --> 01:34:02,160
anything about them.
You can't even see that they're there.

1624
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,060
He say,
well,

1625
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:05,550
I'm not the sort of person that would 
ever do anything like that,

1626
01:34:05,551 --> 01:34:08,720
which is of course just patently,
patently ridiculous.

1627
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:12,510
Once you see that you are capable of 
killing someone or are capable of,

1628
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:14,120
you know,
aggressive behavior,

1629
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:19,320
it almost makes you not the hero not to 
act upon those.

1630
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,990
Aggressiveness stinks.
I mean,

1631
01:34:20,991 --> 01:34:22,800
there may be some certain cases where,
yeah,

1632
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:25,860
that's actually our right.
You know,

1633
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:26,813
if you're four years,
six years old and you go to the 

1634
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:30,270
playground and the nine year old pounds,
you flat,

1635
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,550
you can't go home thinking while I did 
the right thing,

1636
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:33,384
I was nonviolent because the reason you 
were nonviolent just because you got 

1637
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,693
pounded,
clap.

1638
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:40,290
Now it's different situation entirely.
If you go out somewhere and you have the

1639
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:41,124
capability of truly aggressive response 
and you're provoking and you don't 

1640
01:34:44,071 --> 01:34:46,530
manifest it well,
then that's a different circumstance,

1641
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,690
but the mere lack of ability to respond 
in a negative way,

1642
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:51,870
it's no indication whatsoever of any 
morality.

1643
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:54,180
That's why I need you to send no 
standing.

1644
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:55,014
Morality is cowardice.
It wasn't because he thought all 

1645
01:34:57,471 --> 01:35:02,471
morality equals cowardice.
It's because much of much of what passes

1646
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:07,490
for what much of what people define to 
themselves as their own morality is just

1647
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:08,324
their own cowardice.
That's part of the reason why I figures 

1648
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:11,323
like the gangster are so popular in 
American mythology because they act out 

1649
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:17,450
what everyone would actually like to do,
so to speak,

1650
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:20,510
but is too moral,
which isn't the case at all too cowardly

1651
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:23,450
to do.
Now there's positive and well,

1652
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:28,940
how can you simultaneously say that I'm 
the person who denies,

1653
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,020
um,
error,

1654
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:31,903
the are the person who denies this 
within them as evil and yet killing is 

1655
01:35:35,911 --> 01:35:37,300
evil.
Um,

1656
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:39,330
how can you say those two things?

1657
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:41,680
Well,
I didn't say the ladder.

1658
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:44,490
What killing isn't,
but that's what I'm trying to get at.

1659
01:35:44,491 --> 01:35:47,940
Like are we trying to say here that 
killing is evil?

1660
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,600
Look

1661
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,000
there only one way to answer that 
question I guess.

1662
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:53,834
And that is one of the things that are.
One of the things that's constantly 

1663
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:00,980
referred to in hero mythologies is the 
fact that

1664
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,610
you shouldn't break a traditional rule.
Okay?

1665
01:36:05,611 --> 01:36:07,160
So that answers that question,
right?

1666
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:08,063
It's wrong.
But then there's a problem with that in 

1667
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:10,914
the traditional rules as listed are not 
a sufficient and complete guide to 

1668
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,710
adaptations.
So then the question is,

1669
01:36:16,711 --> 01:36:17,544
well,
under what circumstances is it 

1670
01:36:18,361 --> 01:36:20,910
reasonable to break a rule?
Well that's a different issue.

1671
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:23,970
And so in the broad sense you can say,
well,

1672
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:25,320
you know,
do you want to be good?

1673
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,880
Well then you follow the Ten 
Commandments.

1674
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:31,530
I mean there are there rules upon which 
most civilized societies are structured,

1675
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,393
fine,
but there are situations in which the 

1676
01:36:34,261 --> 01:36:36,150
rules conflict,
for example,

1677
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:37,163
or whether where perhaps they're not 
necessarily applicable well under those 

1678
01:36:40,141 --> 01:36:42,630
circumstances than what can guide your 
morality.

1679
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:43,980
Well,
that's the question that we're trying to

1680
01:36:43,981 --> 01:36:48,150
answer here because we also need to know
if this is the theory,

1681
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:51,240
so to speak.
What's the practical implication?

1682
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,100
Because that's one thing that you need 
to know.

1683
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:54,913
I mean that's the only reason that any 
of these stories have any relevance to 

1684
01:36:56,941 --> 01:37:01,941
begin with.
Well,

1685
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,153
it's your attitude towards the novelist.
Information in large part determines 

1686
01:37:08,821 --> 01:37:10,730
your morality.
So let's say,

1687
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,780
let's see if we can figure out what that
means.

1688
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:16,380
First of all,
I would say,

1689
01:37:16,381 --> 01:37:17,740
look,
it's the case that

1690
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:22,910
no,

1691
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:25,610
you might ask yourself the question,
what does life have?

1692
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:26,350
Any beans?
Well,

1693
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:28,730
that's the question that people often 
ask themselves and I would say,

1694
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:30,260
well,
what is that you mean by that?

1695
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:31,730
Well,
what does meaning mean?

1696
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,160
Well,
for me it means implication for action.

1697
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,140
I mean that's what we mean when we say 
meaning,

1698
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:38,480
are we meeting emotional significance?
And then I would say,

1699
01:37:38,481 --> 01:37:39,314
well,
so we're going to look at this 

1700
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:41,540
structure.
Emotional significance.

1701
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:42,683
Well,
what does anomalous information for 

1702
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,650
Dusek well,
anxiety,

1703
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,470
especially if it's involuntary

1704
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:51,990
hope,
hope,

1705
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:58,530
interest.
Oh,

1706
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:03,530
isn't that interesting means that has 
some significance for my behavior or the

1707
01:38:03,531 --> 01:38:06,440
way that I interpret things that I'd 
never considered before.

1708
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:12,913
Speed.

1709
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:32,940
I'm going to read the last three days.
That'll pretty much do this.

1710
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,233
Do a same interest is meaning,
meaning is the manifestation of the 

1711
01:38:38,991 --> 01:38:41,930
divine,
which is the individual adaptive path.

1712
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,473
Pursued of interest necessarily exposes 
the individual tomorrow when social 

1713
01:38:48,231 --> 01:38:49,064
limitations,
I'm produces a symbolic death of 

1714
01:38:50,811 --> 01:38:51,644
personality which sort of simultaneously
as the precondition to renewal an 

1715
01:38:55,101 --> 01:38:58,940
antidote to the necessity of real death.
When circumstances inevitably change.

1716
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,010
What does that mean?
Well,

1717
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,083
if you watch your experience,
there are going to be phenomena that 

1718
01:39:03,891 --> 01:39:08,150
appear to you as if they're meaningful.
I would say they attract your interest.

1719
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:08,984
You can watch yourself.
Your interest will be attracted by the 

1720
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,130
not even on your own accord,
so to speak,

1721
01:39:13,131 --> 01:39:13,964
just by the fact that those phenomena 
for reasons that you might not 

1722
01:39:15,891 --> 01:39:19,010
understand,
produce an orienting response or in your

1723
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,930
heightened your interest.
Well,

1724
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:24,890
I would say that that's evidence of the 
manifestation of the unknown,

1725
01:39:24,891 --> 01:39:25,724
so to speak,
from within the perspective of your 

1726
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:28,004
particular philosophical framework says 
if you follow those things that appear 

1727
01:39:31,161 --> 01:39:34,640
to you as meaningful,
which is what you want to do anyways,

1728
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:35,474
because it is the case that that is the 
sort of thing that people want to do 

1729
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:38,480
virtually.

1730
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,313
By definition.
What will happen is you'll end up 

1731
01:39:43,221 --> 01:39:45,590
participating in the process that you 
described,

1732
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:46,573
which is to say that if you hold onto 
your interest and don't let it go 

1733
01:39:48,501 --> 01:39:49,334
despite all the social pressure that 
you'll find not to do it because you're 

1734
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:53,624
supposed to be doing the thing that 
everyone else says is useful and the 

1735
01:39:55,851 --> 01:39:56,684
fact that it's going to expose to you 
all sorts of things that you didn't 

1736
01:39:58,281 --> 01:39:59,360
understand to begin with.

1737
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:00,893
Well,
what if I find it immensely interesting 

1738
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:05,574
to cut to it?

1739
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:06,580
Well,
no,

1740
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,910
no,
this is absolutely,

1741
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:09,980
absolutely.
We will definitely discuss that.

1742
01:40:09,981 --> 01:40:10,610
I mean,
that's.

1743
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:13,160
Look,
there's two poles obviously say you know

1744
01:40:13,161 --> 01:40:15,050
what's like Joseph Campbell?
He says,

1745
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,430
follow your bliss,
right?

1746
01:40:16,431 --> 01:40:17,264
Well,
in the first thing that pops into the 

1747
01:40:18,261 --> 01:40:20,690
head of the good paranoid is exactly 
what Daniel popped up.

1748
01:40:20,691 --> 01:40:23,360
It's like,
what if my interest is serial killing?

1749
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:26,570
Because if you read,
if you read accounts of serial killers,

1750
01:40:26,571 --> 01:40:27,404
for example,
what you find very rapidly is that 

1751
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:29,503
they're very interested in what they 
were doing and so if you are very 

1752
01:40:31,671 --> 01:40:32,504
interested,
they couldn't start doing and they got 

1753
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:37,670
their interest expanded as they 
continued to pursue the territory.

1754
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:38,803
So you say,
well obviously interesting in of itself 

1755
01:40:41,811 --> 01:40:42,644
is known as sufficient guide because you
can interest can manifest itself within 

1756
01:40:46,401 --> 01:40:49,750
the confines of the personality that so 
pathological than in,

1757
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,820
in and of itself is a sign post for 
pathology.

1758
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:54,063
When I say,
well,

1759
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,100
that's why we concentrated so much on 
this.

1760
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,910
So if you feel your head up with 
garbage,

1761
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,833
what did labels is interesting,
it's no longer going to be healthy and 

1762
01:41:04,631 --> 01:41:05,464
so there's two poles to the sort of 
moral process that we've been 

1763
01:41:07,451 --> 01:41:09,970
describing.
One is do what you're interested in.

1764
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:11,590
Make sure you do what you're interested 
in.

1765
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:15,460
The second thing is don't lie to 
yourself because if you lie to yourself,

1766
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,330
you're going to work the mechanism that 
produces interest as a phenomena because

1767
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:21,050
we already know,
look,

1768
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:25,540
we already know that.
What occurs to you as anomalous,

1769
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:28,270
what pops up in your phenomenological 
field as meaningful?

1770
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,313
It's going to be dependent very much on 
the philosophical theory that you bring 

1771
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:34,900
to bear on the event is write your 
goals,

1772
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:37,000
the ends you have in mind and so on and 
so forth,

1773
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:39,250
determined the significance of 
phenomena.

1774
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:40,653
The only way you can ensure that those 
structures are healthy is if their 

1775
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:45,604
existence accounts for all of the 
experience that you've actually had in 

1776
01:41:48,131 --> 01:41:48,964
the past,
which is to say that you've constantly 

1777
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:51,184
modified and updated your worldview to 
account for all of the experience that 

1778
01:41:54,731 --> 01:41:56,890
you've had.
But if you don't do that,

1779
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:58,203
you're living within a philosophy that's
twisted off cedric precisely to the 

1780
01:42:01,301 --> 01:42:03,580
degree that you've twisted it off 
center.

1781
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:04,863
The more that it's twisted,
the more that whole structure is going 

1782
01:42:07,231 --> 01:42:10,240
to produce intimations of meaning where 
they shouldn't be,

1783
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:13,690
and then if you follow those well,
they'll lead you places that perhaps you

1784
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:16,630
would have never really wanted to go or 
maybe deeply,

1785
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:17,464
unconsciously,
perhaps leading you exactly where you 

1786
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:21,550
want it to go.
It depends on how you look at it.

1787
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:25,150
So there's two poles.
One is when it comes right down to it,

1788
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:28,050
the only thing that you have to rely on 
is the phenomena,

1789
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:28,923
meaning you know what it occurs and when
it doesn't mean if you're immersed in 

1790
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:33,430
something you really love,
what are they?

1791
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:38,490
One of the phenomena that might be that 
the self consciousness vanishes.

1792
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:41,300
That's one thing you can see what 
performers who are really great,

1793
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:42,453
they're really immersed in what they're 
doing is that they're very attractive 

1794
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:45,814
because they've mastered that domain so 
well that they pay absolutely no 

1795
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:49,834
attention to themselves as phenomenon 
while they're doing whatever it is 

1796
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:52,504
they've been doing.
Another thing is if you're immersed in 

1797
01:42:54,281 --> 01:42:55,114
that,
then your notion of time tends to 

1798
01:42:56,951 --> 01:42:57,784
disappear so you can be working very 
hard on whatever it is that you're 

1799
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:00,940
interested in book.
I say,

1800
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:02,170
well,
where did it all the time?

1801
01:43:02,171 --> 01:43:03,280
Nope,
and I would say,

1802
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:04,114
well,
that's another indication that that's 

1803
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:10,540
that phenomenon is producing an added 
note to self consciousness because a big

1804
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:13,660
aspect of self consciousness is tick,
tick,

1805
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:16,150
tick,
tick of the consciousness of time.

1806
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,300
What pops you out of that?
Meaning?

1807
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:21,993
Where does meaning manifest itself?
It manifests itself on the border 

1808
01:43:25,391 --> 01:43:29,280
between order and chaos and the reason 
it does that is because that's where all

1809
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:34,090
the adaptive processes are taking place.
That's where you have to be operating in

1810
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,930
in order to ensure that the phenomena 
that you use to interpret the world with

1811
01:43:37,931 --> 01:43:38,764
the structures you use to interpret the 
world are constantly being updated and 

1812
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:42,214
also those of your society are 
constantly being updated because after 

1813
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:49,120
all I discover something and then I tell
it to you and that's how.

1814
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:52,160
So that means that the individual 
process of creative

1815
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:55,070
exploration updates the social world as 
well.

1816
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:56,903
So

1817
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,030
it's not a simple matter of,
well,

1818
01:44:00,031 --> 01:44:01,920
the other thing Campbell's statement for
example,

1819
01:44:01,921 --> 01:44:03,000
is follow your bliss.
Well,

1820
01:44:03,001 --> 01:44:06,450
this strikes me as quite quite one sided
in the sense as well,

1821
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:09,630
and I guess that's the problem with new 
age philosophy.

1822
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,540
I mean,
that's why I like his works on alchemy.

1823
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:12,423
I said,
look,

1824
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:15,180
you look where you don't want to look.
Now,

1825
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,103
if someone tells you that it strikes me 
that maybe you could believe it seems 

1826
01:44:18,811 --> 01:44:20,880
realistic to me,
rather than a message that says,

1827
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:21,830
well,
if you do,

1828
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,720
if you do in some simplistic sense,
whatever makes you happy,

1829
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:26,500
that's perfectly fine,
so young,

1830
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:27,403
escaping through his analysis of this 
chemical process that if you pay 

1831
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:31,584
attention to what you find meaningful,
it will take you to the place where you 

1832
01:44:33,781 --> 01:44:34,614
would least likely to want to go first
because of because of the necessity of 

1833
01:44:39,481 --> 01:44:40,590
this process emerging.

1834
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:43,400
Okay.

1835
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:54,893
The abandonment of meaning ensures the 
induction of the demonic mode of 

1836
01:44:56,911 --> 01:44:57,744
adaptation because the individual hates 
point is pain and frustration and we'll 

1837
01:45:02,641 --> 01:45:03,474
work towards destruction of its source.
This work constitutes his revenge 

1838
01:45:06,481 --> 01:45:09,450
against existence,
which is pride is rendered unbearable.

1839
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:11,903
Rebirth is reestablishment of interest 
after adoption of culturally determined 

1840
01:45:16,111 --> 01:45:16,944
competence is rebirth,
makes the individualist practically 

1841
01:45:19,591 --> 01:45:20,424
adapted as anyone in history has 
motivated is he has courage to be the 

1842
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:28,230
rebirth of interest moves man to the 
border between the known culture and the

1843
01:45:28,231 --> 01:45:29,064
unknown nature and thereby expands is 
adaptive competence his in the world in 

1844
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,540
this manner,
the domain of history is expanded.

1845
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:38,723
This capability for extension is the 
manifestation of God within the 

1846
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:41,934
individual in the modern world.
Socialization should allow the 

1847
01:45:45,121 --> 01:45:48,900
individual to devote the power of 
history to the act of exploration.

1848
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:52,740
Interest manifested in the absence of 
self deceit,

1849
01:45:52,741 --> 01:45:53,574
places each of us on the border of the 
unknown and removes the tragedy from 

1850
01:45:56,941 --> 01:45:57,774
temporality.

1851
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,483
The pursuit of subjective of interest in
there inevitably brings each individual 

1852
01:46:02,281 --> 01:46:03,114
into contact with his own fears,
such contact mediocre in the social 

1853
01:46:06,871 --> 01:46:07,704
sphere when expression of individuality 
conflicts with normative behavior or in 

1854
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:12,114
this sphere of the absolutely unknown.
When pursuit of individual interest 

1855
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:16,013
takes man beyond the cultural Canada and
places him against the forces that 

1856
01:46:18,931 --> 01:46:19,764
govern mortality and limitation per se.
The heroic motive being is predicated 

1857
01:46:24,361 --> 01:46:27,930
upon the assumption that something 
divine exists within the individual that

1858
01:46:27,931 --> 01:46:31,890
is capable of manifesting itself when 
called upon when necessary.

1859
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,353
This is individual possibility arises to
meet the challenge presented by life 

1860
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:38,303
without faith in the heroic challenge 
must be avoided from the practical 

1861
01:46:41,821 --> 01:46:42,654
viewpoint,
this means the abandonment of 

1862
01:46:43,561 --> 01:46:46,260
subjectivity and the search for 
security.

1863
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,933
This choice eliminates the possibility 
for personal development and increases 

1864
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:52,014
the likelihood of fanatic identification
with history or adoption about outright 

1865
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:56,103
distractedness.

1866
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,660
Selfconsciousness means in knowledge of 
individual vulnerability.

1867
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:02,223
The process by which this knowledge 
comes to be can destroy faith and 

1868
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:05,334
individual work.
What this means in concrete terms is 

1869
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:10,950
that in the course of development and 
the individual may come to sacrifice his

1870
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:11,813
own experience because it's pursuit 
creates social conflict or exposes 

1871
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:18,270
individual inadequacy.
However,

1872
01:47:18,271 --> 01:47:19,104
it is only through such conflict that 
change takes place and weakness must be 

1873
01:47:21,721 --> 01:47:24,240
recognized before it can be transformed 
into strength.

1874
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:28,410
This means that the sacrifice of 
individuality eliminates any possibility

1875
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:30,720
that individual strength can be 
discovered or developed,

1876
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:31,883
and then history itself can progress.
Individuals whose life is without 

1877
01:47:35,911 --> 01:47:36,744
meaning hate themselves for their 
weakness and hate life or making them 

1878
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:40,824
weak.
His hatred manifests itself and 

1879
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:43,164
identification with destructive power 
and it's mythological historical and 

1880
01:47:46,381 --> 01:47:47,214
biological manifestations and in desire 
for the absolute extinction of 

1881
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:52,560
existence.
Such identification leads,

1882
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:54,870
Manda poison,
whatever he touches degenerate,

1883
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:55,853
unnecessary misery in the face of 
inevitable suffering to turn this 

1884
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:02,340
fellows against themselves,
to intermingle earth with hail merely to

1885
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:04,530
attain vengeance upon God garden,
his creation,

1886
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,980
the human purpose,
if such a thing can be considered,

1887
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:08,843
is to pursue meaning to extend the 
domain of light and consciousness in 

1888
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:13,320
spite of limitation.

1889
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:17,670
Meaningful event exists on the boundary 
between security and novelty.

1890
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,953
The pursuit of meaning exposes the 
individual to the unknown in gradual 

1891
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:22,404
fashion,
allowing him to develop strength and 

1892
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:24,714
adaptive ability in proportion to the 
seriousness of his pursuit is during 

1893
01:48:28,621 --> 01:48:32,760
contact with an unknown that human power
grows individually and then historically

1894
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,973
meaning is the subjective experience 
associated with that contact and 

1895
01:48:37,181 --> 01:48:38,014
sufficient proportion,
the great religious misstate that 

1896
01:48:42,271 --> 01:48:43,104
continued pursuit of meaning adopted 
voluntarily and without self deception 

1897
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,070
will lead the individual to discover his
identity with God and to the bead,

1898
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:52,680
thereby capable of withstanding the 
tragedy of life.

1899
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,370
Abandoned of such meaning reduces man 
who is more than weaknesses.

1900
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:59,520
It makes them hate life and work towards
it's elimination.

1901
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,900
It could be said that meeting is the 
most profound manifestation of instinct,

1902
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:08,460
so that's why I think Adam hid from God 
in the garden of Eden.

1903
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,110
Man is a creature attracted by the 
unknown and adapted for its conquest.

1904
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:14,953
The subjective sense of meeting is the 
instinct governing rate of contact with 

1905
01:49:17,611 --> 01:49:20,850
the unknown.
Too much exposure turns changed to chaos

1906
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:23,850
and too little promote stagnation and 
degeneration.

1907
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:25,343
The appropriate balance produces a 
powerful individual confidence in the 

1908
01:49:28,321 --> 01:49:29,154
ability to withstand life,
ever more able to deal with nature and 

1909
01:49:31,621 --> 01:49:34,230
society and ever closer to the heroic 
ideal.

1910
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,360
Each individual constitutional unique 
finds meaning in different pursuits.

1911
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:41,880
If he has the courage to maintain his 
difference,

1912
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:43,493
manifestation of individual diversity 
transformed into knowledge that can be 

1913
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:51,400
transferred socially changes the face of
history itself and moves each generation

1914
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:56,401
of men farther into the unknown.
Social and biological conditions defined

1915
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,413
the boundaries of individual existence.
The unfailing pursuit of interest 

1916
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:01,444
provides the subject of means by which 
these conditions can be met and their 

1917
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:05,044
boundaries.
Transcendent meaning is the instinct 

1918
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:09,010
that makes life possible.

1919
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:10,223
When it is abandoned,
individuality loses its redemptive 

1920
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,353
power.
The great lie is that meaning does not 

1921
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:16,114
exist or that it is not important.
When meaning is denied hatred for life 

1922
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:22,240
and the for destruction inevitably 
rules.

1923
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:26,810
If you bring forth what is within you,
what you bring forth will save you.

1924
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,200
If you do not bring forth what is within
you,

1925
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:30,303
what you do not bring forth will destroy
the wisdom of the group can serve as a 

1926
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:35,404
forest that mediates between the 
dependency of childhood and the 

1927
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:38,194
responsibility of the adult.
This makes history of the power that 

1928
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:41,674
serves the individual society predicated
upon belief in the divinity of the 

1929
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:46,684
individual,
allows individual interests to flourish 

1930
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:52,450
and to serve as the forest that opposes 
the tyranny of culture and the terror of

1931
01:50:52,451 --> 01:50:53,284
nature.
The denial of meaning by contrast 

1932
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,980
ensures absolute identification with the
group or interest psychic degeneration.

1933
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:00,813
If such identification fails,
the denial of meaning makes the 

1934
01:51:04,211 --> 01:51:05,044
individual desperate.
When the validity of identification is 

1935
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:11,860
challenged and the great maternal sea of
chaos threatens his weakness,

1936
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:12,694
makes them hate life as well and to work
for it's devastation in him and as well 

1937
01:51:15,951 --> 01:51:16,784
as those around the lie,
as the Central Act in this drama of 

1938
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:20,404
corruption.
These are the secrets sayings which the 

1939
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:24,244
living Jesus Spoken,
which did a most Judas Thomas wrote 

1940
01:51:26,141 --> 01:51:29,050
down.
This is from the Nag Hammadi Library,

1941
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:30,803
and he said,
whoever finds the interpretation of 

1942
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:36,490
these sayings will not experience death.
Christ said,

1943
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:40,090
let him who seeks continue seeking until
he finds,

1944
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,163
when he becomes troubled,
he will be astonished and he will rule 

1945
01:51:44,081 --> 01:51:48,880
over the all Jesus said,
if those who lead you say to you,

1946
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:53,440
see the kingdom is in the sky than the 
birds of the sky will precede you.

1947
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:54,783
If they say to you it is in the sea and 
the fish will proceed you rather the 

1948
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:00,820
kingdom is inside of you and it is 
outside of you.

1949
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,193
When you come to know yourselves,
then you will become known and you will 

1950
01:52:04,781 --> 01:52:05,614
realize that is in you,
that it is you who are the sons of the 

1951
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:10,480
living father,
but if you will not know yourselves,

1952
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,360
you dwell in poverty and it is you who 
are that poverty.

1953
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,510
Christ said,
the old man,

1954
01:52:16,511 --> 01:52:17,344
olden days will not hesitate to ask a 
small child seven days old about the 

1955
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:21,154
place of life and he will live for many 
who are first will become lost and they 

1956
01:52:24,431 --> 01:52:26,980
will become one in the same.
Christ said,

1957
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,773
recognize what is in your site and that 
which is hidden from you will be 

1958
01:52:32,051 --> 01:52:32,884
complaining to you for there is nothing 
hidden which will not become manifest 

1959
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:40,480
his disciples and said to him,
do you want us to fast?

1960
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,060
How shall we pray?
Shall we give arms?

1961
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,130
What Diet shall we observe?
Christ said,

1962
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,860
do not tell lines and do not do what you
hate.

1963
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:50,143
For all things are playing in this side 
of heaven for nothing hidden will not 

1964
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:56,090
become manifest and nothing covered will
remain without being uncovered.

1965
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:08,623
That's it.

1966
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:16,420
Thanks.
