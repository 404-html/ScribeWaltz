1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,900
Things I've been thinking about here 
recently,

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,830
and I don't know why I hadn't really 
realized this before,

3
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:09,300
but you realize things in stages is that
I think that this model,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,450
this hierarchy,
is actually a model of the unconscious,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,230
so when people talk about the 
unconscious,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,303
I think this is what it is because 
there's the procedural unconscious 

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,270
that's at the lowest level,
right?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,113
Because that's movement,
so that would be procedural memory and 

9
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,494
then the the,
the hierarchies above that are 

10
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,334
representational.
Most of them more or liberty or called 

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,690
kinetic melodies,
which would be

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,613
habitual patterns of behavior that 
you've mastered strung together in a 

13
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,364
novel way,
but then above that that starts to 

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,980
become representational and so I think 
for example,

15
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,900
when you're digging to the bottom of 
things,

16
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,734
when you're having a conversation and 
the unconscious opens up in the 

17
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,424
conversation,
which almost always happens if you're 

18
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,370
having a dispute with someone,
right?

19
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,590
You say,
what do you really mean?

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,873
And then they have to decompose what 
they're saying into its subsidiary 

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
elements and sometimes that's a search,
but sometimes it's actually,

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,210
I'm a meditation.
Where did that idea come from?

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,430
What is the underlying structure,
so,

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,560
okay,
so keep that in mind.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,413
And then

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,263
we were talking about play last time and
we talked about the fact that even 

27
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,730
animals have rules for play and that 
that's the evidence,

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,623
that's evidence that there are modes of 
interaction between animals in a social 

29
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,740
environment that are acceptable to both 
animals,

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,190
such that they will voluntarily continue
and,

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,010
and such that they aren't so,
so,

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,933
and you know,
it's a Piagetian observation that that 

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,700
constitutes one of the basis of,
of moral behavior.

34
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,120
And that seems to me to be a very,
very powerful insight because it takes,

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,960
it takes the idea that there's something
arbitrary about morality.

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,670
It takes that out of the picture.
It says,

37
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,890
well it's,
it's malleable,

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,090
but it's not arbitrary,
you know,

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,933
it can't just be anything.
So that still leaves you with the 

40
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,450
problem of how large the boundaries are.
And that's a tough one because obviously

41
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,284
you all know that there are many ways to
play that all function as acceptable 

42
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:12,534
play.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,673
Although one of the rules would be 
everybody who's playing the game 

44
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,720
actually has to agree to play it,
you know?

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,554
And that seems to me to be something 
like an absolute rule regarding social 

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,850
conventions.
So.

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,223
So again,
it's a process rule rather than a 

48
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,190
content rule to some degree.
But that's okay.

49
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,580
That's still important.
All right,

50
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,840
so now I believe we talked a little bit 
about friends.

51
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,740
The walls work with chimps,
right?

52
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,010
And I mentioned that what the wall has 
found out is that it isn't just the,

53
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
you know,
the caveman chimp with the biggest club 

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,873
who's the top chimp,
that top champ in a hierarchy that 

55
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,114
remains relatively stable and who 
doesn't get torn to shreds by his 

56
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,390
subordinates,
can't be an absolute tyrant.

57
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,224
There are social conventions that he has
to follow and those seem to involve the 

58
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,890
ability to form coalitions with other 
males.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,053
So there's a cooperative element and 
then also attention to the females and 

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,540
the infants that are in the chimp troupe
as well.

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
And in some sense,
what it seems to indicate is that the 

62
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,931
more sophisticated the top guy,
because in chimps it's usually a guy,

63
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,983
I think it's always a guy in chimps.
The more sophisticated he is in his 

64
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,570
social maneuvering,
the more stable the result and hierarchy

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,040
and so what that implies as we've 
discussed is that there are,

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,913
there are differences that are 
qualitative between hierarchies and 

67
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,070
that's again,
that's a moral hierarchy.

68
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:44,071
Some function better than others.
Some you have to define better,

69
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,930
but I think it's reasonable to define 
better.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,200
Again from a modified Cooney and Eddie 
had perspective.

71
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,960
You say better,
a better system is one that does all the

72
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,794
functions of the previous system plus 
more or that it's more stable or 

73
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,540
something like that.
You can define better.

74
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,943
So

75
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,453
now

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,080
this particular

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,193
pictorial representation,
I'm trying to transmute this into into 

78
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:18,090
another dimension of representation.
So you've got here,

79
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:23,091
you've got your high dominant primate,
and so he,

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,250
he represents something if he's 
dominant,

81
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,113
what he represents,
his dominance and we're associating 

82
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,080
dominance to some degree with competence
in the competence is social competence.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,233
And so you can think that there's a 
pattern that constitutes acceptable 

84
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,114
dominant side.
I think you could think about that as 

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,420
authority.
You know what I mean?

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,343
People especially rather simple minded.
Social critics like to think that 

87
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,810
dominance hierarchies are only based on 
power,

88
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,063
right,
but that's except in the most brutal of 

89
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:55,480
societies.
That's just not the case because there's

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,333
power,
but there's also competence and lots of 

91
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,883
hierarchies in a functional society are 
predicated on competence and so what's 

92
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:05,910
at the top isn't dominance precisely.
It's authority and authority is a better

93
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:06,870
way of thinking about it.

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,150
So then the question might be,
well,

95
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:12,870
how is our authority represented?
And then also what is it?

96
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,973
And so imagine that for app chimp or 
maybe for now we'll go with chimp 

97
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,243
because we don't know how long ago it 
was in history when people started to 

98
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,700
abstract out these things.
You know,

99
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,863
if you think of a word like chief,
as soon as there's a word like that 

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,190
chief isn't or tribal leader or whatever
the term might be.

101
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,470
The fact that that term exists indicates
that there's a category for authority.

102
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,333
Right?
And what that means is that as soon as 

103
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,374
you have a category for authority,
you can detached the idea of authority 

104
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,250
from the authority holder and you can 
start to think about itself right?

105
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,930
In a,
in a troop,

106
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,764
like in a chimp troupe,
there's no authority independent of the 

107
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,240
thing that's at the top.

108
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,300
It's completely embodied.
Even though you might be able to say,

109
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,760
if you are an anthropological observer,
you might be able to say,

110
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,110
well,
there is some common,

111
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,973
here's a chimp true here,
and there's a chimp true peer and 

112
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,680
another one here,
and you could say,

113
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,783
well,
there's some commonality and behavior 

114
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,900
across all of the chimps that are at the
top,

115
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,010
but the chimps don't know that it's just
a natural fact at that point,

116
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,083
but as soon as you can make the category
or the category leader something like 

117
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,684
that,
then what you're starting to do is to 

118
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,480
conceptualize the principles that make 
authority authority.

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,410
So and that's because we can abstract 
and because we can represent.

120
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,420
We've been doing that for a very long 
period of time.

121
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,493
You know,
we do that as modern people all the 

122
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,150
time.
There's,

123
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,410
there's a huge body of studies,
studies in management,

124
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,770
science about what makes a leader.

125
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,630
Now.
It turns out that it's very,

126
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:54,464
very difficult to go into that 
literature and extract out anything of 

127
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,390
any generality,
you know,

128
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,220
I mean,
my sense,

129
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,283
my sense was in reviewing that 
literature that one of the things you 

130
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:09,650
can say about a leader is that a leader 
knows where he's going,

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,610
but once you go past that,
then the,

132
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,493
what constitutes leadership in complex 
human organizations is hard to 

133
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,564
articulate,
but it's also rather situation 

134
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,360
dependent,
you know.

135
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,194
And I would also say there's different 
ways of being a leader that are 

136
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,510
dependent on temperament that maybe all 
be functional.

137
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,060
So trying to categorize that as quite 
difficult,

138
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:32,894
but people still have been trying to do 
that for a very long time and they've 

139
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,370
got,
they've gone a very long way.

140
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,443
So here's a way,
here's the symbolic transmutation in 

141
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,170
some sense.
So,

142
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,480
um,
at,

143
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,413
at the left top left there,
you've got people playing football and 

144
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:51,320
then in the middle there you've got an 
abstract representation of a game.

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,153
So computer games are quite interesting 
because they've taken the whole 

146
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,830
abstraction process one step further 
right there.

147
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,240
Representations of representations of 
representation so you can play with them

148
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,140
and their simulation,
so then the ones on the,

149
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,930
on the on the far right,
the bottom one,

150
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,764
you see there's a guy standing down 
there and he's gazing up at God and 

151
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,430
heaven with this cross.
Right?

152
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,930
And to me that essentially a dominance 
relationship is that.

153
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,180
Think about it.
Anyway,

154
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,170
so,
so first of all,

155
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,630
you're looking up to see the source of 
authority.

156
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:25,820
So there's the idea that authority is 
above you.

157
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,654
Somehow I would say that that 
representation is an attempt to capture 

158
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:33,650
an image.
What authority constitutes.

159
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,783
Now when people were capturing this an 
image like they are in that particular 

160
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,144
drawing,
it isn't that they were trying to put 

161
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,120
into images something they understood in
an articulated way.

162
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,133
It's exactly the opposite is that the 
phenomena itself of authority as a 

163
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:54,080
concept emerged on the basis of the 
processes we've been describing,

164
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:54,914
which means that it emerged from the 
bottom up as as as increasingly complex 

165
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,504
social animals organize themselves into 
increasingly complex and large social 

166
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,154
hierarchies.
There was an emergence and emergence of 

167
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,680
morality as a consequence of that 
organization.

168
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
And then there was an observation of it,
you might think,

169
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,590
well,
what form would that observation take?

170
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,693
And it's a union hypothesis and I think 
it's a very good one that part of what 

171
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:27,171
the artistic endeavor does is transmute 
what's not understood yet into image,

172
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,393
image and drama.
And that's the source of its further 

173
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,830
articulation up into stateable rules.
So for so,

174
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,903
so first of all,
the bottom picture there indicates that 

175
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,320
a human being can be struck by the 
concept of authority per se.

176
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,880
You know,
so you might think,

177
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:49,500
well what's even more of an authority 
than an authority?

178
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,423
And the answer to that is it's whatever 
makes authorities authorities across a 

179
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,550
large class if authorities and they 
might say,

180
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,280
well what is that?
And the answer to that is,

181
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,010
while we're still figuring that out,
because it's so damn complicated,

182
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:02,844
it's unbelievably complicated.
Now I can tell you some things about 

183
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:07,254
that image.
I can tell you some things that it 

184
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,380
represents.
What it means is that first of all,

185
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
it means that authority has this 
transpersonal process that's 

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,520
transpersonal existence,
that's eternal.

187
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,590
So,
and why is that?

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,453
Well,
it's because what makes authority 

189
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,860
authority is stable across hierarchies.
Hierarchies can come and go,

190
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:26,963
but the concept itself has an eternal 
element to it because it remains 

191
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:34,680
constant across transformations and I 
think that's represented in the symbolic

192
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,630
realm by the idea of God in heaven.

193
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,660
It's something like that.
Now I got to tell you to.

194
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,763
I'm not trying to reduce these religious
explanations to the concepts that I'm 

195
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:45,654
describing because I don't think that 
what I'm telling you is a complete 

196
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:48,894
representation of what happens,
so there's a transcendent element to 

197
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,364
religious thinking that you can't 
explain away by by reducing it to its 

198
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,090
constituent elements.
But having said that,

199
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:00,924
we're just going to put that aside.
We're going to try to make it as 

200
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:06,990
concrete as possible.
Now in this representation,

201
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,190
the idea basically is that authority has
something to do with the father,

202
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,770
right?
It has something to do with eternity and

203
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:17,050
transcendence and it also has something 
to do with the cross.

204
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,650
It's Christian representation,
so that's fine.

205
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,940
It's a hypothesis is what that is.
Now it's a weird hypothesis,

206
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:24,774
right?
If you look at that picture and you 

207
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:31,050
start thinking about it from an 
anthropological perspective instead of a

208
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,670
personal perspective,
you might think,

209
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,504
well,
what the hell are these creatures up to 

210
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,120
when they're making representation like 
that?

211
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,760
It's what are they trying to express,
you know,

212
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,580
and the classical view would be,
well,

213
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:44,700
this is a belief and the belief is being
imposed on the viewers.

214
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,421
It's like,
well,

215
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,860
let's,
let's not assume that.

216
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,330
Let's,
let's try something different.

217
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,230
Let's assume that it's an explanation 
that people have been trying to work out

218
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,303
that nobody really understands and I 
think that that's a much better way of 

219
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,250
looking at it because otherwise you're 
stuck with some bloody conspiracy theory

220
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,520
of history or something like that.
You know,

221
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,363
and I think one of the advantages we 
have in the 21st century is because our 

222
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:11,140
culture now is composed of such an 
intermingling of cultures.

223
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,663
It enables people,
let's say for the sake of argument in 

224
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,444
the dominant culture to step outside of 
their own presuppositions and start to 

225
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,210
view themselves as anthropologists.
Okay,

226
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:22,781
so you think,
well,

227
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,860
what are people up to?

228
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,911
Well,
first of all,

229
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,160
that figure,
I'm sorry it's not bigger,

230
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:27,994
but I'll show you a bigger one later is 
being held up in heaven by angels so it 

231
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,240
it's,
it's,

232
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,740
it's like there's an idea that it's,
it's.

233
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,723
There is some divine entities out of 
which a top divine entity emerges and 

234
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:42,544
there's a.
that's a father figure in that 

235
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,434
representation.
It's associated with light and it has 

236
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,974
this cross and the cross is a very,
very old symbol and so and in 

237
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,080
Christianity obviously the cross isn't 
representative of the father.

238
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,914
It's representative of the sun and so 
that's interesting because what that 

239
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,030
means is this representation says that 
whatever authority is,

240
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,700
has something of the father and 
something of the son,

241
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,893
and the reason I'm telling you that is 
because it's going to become very 

242
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:10,984
relevant when I tell you the Egyptian,
that one of the fundamental variance of 

243
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,890
the central Egyptian religious story a 
little bit later in class.

244
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,680
So it's not just the farther.
There's something else.

245
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:23,500
And one of the mysteries about 
Christianity for example,

246
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,100
and this is one of the things,
the rationalist.

247
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,550
It's always take Christianity to task 
four is the idea that God is a,

248
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,840
you know,
is a three part unity.

249
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,850
What's very bizarre idea,
you know,

250
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:36,070
and obviously it's not an empirical 
idea,

251
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,053
it's like it's some bizarre fantasy and 
I think that it's expressed quite well 

252
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,910
in that drawing,
at least part of it,

253
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,350
which is,
well yeah,

254
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,933
it's a unity because there's something 
similar about the father in the son and 

255
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,534
there's something that,
that they both need from each other and 

256
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:52,954
it's a dynamic interplay,
but it also has to be something that's 

257
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:55,924
differentiated.
There's utility in differentiating the 

258
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,080
concept,
so.

259
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,580
Okay,
so keep that in mind.

260
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,350
Now the top one there on the right,
that's Moses,

261
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,590
and I'll tell you the story of exodus in
detail later in the class,

262
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:13,420
but one of the things I want to,
to introduce you to is this possibility.

263
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,300
So what happens in exodus basically is 
it's a,

264
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,740
it's a tyranny descend into chaos.
Rise story,

265
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,100
right?
So it's like a,

266
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,433
in some sense,
the exodus story is a microcosm of the 

267
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,370
entire Christian Bible.
So that's kind of interesting.

268
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,950
It's,
it's a story about transformation nested

269
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,960
inside a broader story about 
transformation.

270
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,813
The transformation is everyone's in a 
tyranny and they're being exploited and 

271
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,880
they need to escape.
Okay,

272
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,714
so you should be able to relate to that 
because everybody is in a tyranny and 

273
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:48,514
they're trying to escape.
Now the degree to which the tyranny is 

274
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,540
tyrannical varies a lot between 
societies,

275
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,613
but the classic adolescent experience 
and you see this and coming of age 

276
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:58,520
novel,
it's all at the time,

277
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:02,960
is the young person against the 
establishment,

278
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,430
something like that.
Right,

279
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,710
and that's,
I would say that's an existential,

280
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,480
that's an existential condition.
It's always the young person against,

281
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,400
against the establishment.

282
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,450
Now the establishment is also helping 
the young person,

283
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,990
so it's not the only story,
but it's.

284
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,720
It's an architectural component of the 
story,

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,673
so you have to escape from the tyranny 
of the group and what happens when you 

286
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:29,330
escape from that is your cast into chaos
even if it's a tyrannical group,

287
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:34,331
because even a tyrannical group provides
you with a hierarchy and an identity and

288
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:38,750
maybe it's a pathological hierarchy and 
a pathological identity,

289
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,793
but you could still make the case that 
it's better than no identity at all and 

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,790
I think you play that situation by 
situation.

291
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,740
I mean remember what happens to the 
Israel lights,

292
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,990
right?
They leave Egypt,

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,833
they were all slaves there and they 
ended up in a desert and they're 

294
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,840
wandering around in the desert for 40 
years and lot of them are thinking,

295
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,883
Hey,
it's not so obvious that this chaotic 

296
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,674
existence out here in a desert is better
than where I know my three meals a day 

297
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:05,924
are coming from and you know,
you don't want to think about that is 

298
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,580
merely something that's an abstraction.

299
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,630
It's like there's plenty of people in 
Russia who long for the Soviet Union.

300
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,730
Right?
Because there were,

301
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,220
there was a stability that was 
associated with it.

302
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,190
Now we would say,
and I think the Russians themselves said

303
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,203
that was a pathological stability,
but whether it was worse than the 

304
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,780
consequent chaos is.
Well,

305
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,940
it's to be,
it's to be seen.

306
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,880
We don't know at the moment for some 
societies like Poland,

307
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,450
so like Poland seems to have pulled out 
of it quite nicely,

308
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,080
but there are other countries that 
haven't.

309
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,350
So the chaos,
and I think this is also the conundrum.

310
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,184
It's very much thing we're thinking 
about this because you might think what 

311
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,424
stops people from progressing in terms 
of the quality of their personality 

312
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,840
structure.
And the answer to that is,

313
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,943
well,
every time you want to move forward you 

314
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,740
have to let something go and there's a 
disintegration associated with that.

315
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,940
And so that's somewhat terrifying.
So like maybe you find,

316
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,600
well the case of the abused spouse is a 
good one.

317
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,050
Why go back to someone who abuses you 
and people usually do and.

318
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,410
Well,
and that's partly because,

319
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,540
you know,
couples abuse each other all the time,

320
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,360
so it's a matter of degree.
But you know,

321
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:24,194
if you,
if you go out on the spectrum to the 

322
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:31,340
point where it's pretty damn obvious 
that the abuse is criminal,

323
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,174
let's say,
because that's sort of the bordering 

324
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,600
line,
people will still return.

325
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,063
Well,
why really hard question why sometimes 

326
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:44,900
it's because the abuser conspires to 
make sure that the abused person isn't a

327
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,450
position of such weakness,
that they actually can't leave.

328
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,980
They have no money,
they have no.

329
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,310
And they're terrified.
So you know,

330
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,570
that's that aside.
Well,

331
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,404
what do you give up when you leave while
you give up everything you give up your 

332
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,060
past,
you know,

333
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,240
because you have to think,
Jeez,

334
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,143
that was a mistake and that's going to 
require a lot of thinking through to 

335
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:08,730
figure out why you made that particular 
mistake and how not to make it again,

336
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:09,564
because you probably will because 
whatever got you into that situation to 

337
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:16,080
begin with is undoubtedly still there 
unless you fixed it.

338
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,990
And then of course your future is shot,
right?

339
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:23,310
And so as your present self image and 
that's a chaotic collapse,

340
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,144
you know,
it might mean that you have to move 

341
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,540
cities.
God only knows you have to change jobs,

342
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,300
you have to change where you live,
you have to change all your friends.

343
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,060
It's like,
is that better?

344
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,500
Well,
not obviously,

345
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,470
and so people won't take the leap off 
the burning,

346
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,170
you know,
the burning grasslands on the cliff into

347
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,004
the water below and it's not surprising 
because who knows how many sharks are 

348
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,294
down there and that it's really useful 
to to understand it that way I think 

349
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:54,201
because it tells you why people won't 
transcend themselves constantly.

350
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:54,991
It's like,
well,

351
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,940
you have to make a sacrifice and you 
know,

352
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,990
it's not always obvious that the sacrum,
that the gain you will make,

353
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,993
the sacrifice is worth the costs of the 
sacrifice and that's even in extreme 

354
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:05,760
conditions.

355
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,610
And that's partly why exit.
This is such an archetypal story.

356
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,444
It's like it's not obvious at all to the
Israel lights when they're out in the 

357
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:12,414
desert wandering about half starving,
that it's only faith that keeps them 

358
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,264
going.
Faith that there might be something 

359
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:20,940
better at the other end.
It's like,

360
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,343
well,
so what happens is that they get pretty 

361
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,550
damn crabby at Moses for leading them 
out there.

362
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,384
You know,
and they start to worship all sorts of 

363
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,980
alternative gods,
which is exactly what you do when you're

364
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:35,460
in chaos by the way,
because when you're in chaos,

365
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,820
you're looking for new moral principles 
to Orient Yourself by,

366
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,280
you know,
and those are new hierarchies of value.

367
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:45,050
And to think about those as alternative 
structures of,

368
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,263
you know,
of dominant structures of value that 

369
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,834
could be represented by a given daddy,
that's perfectly reasonable thing to do 

370
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,703
is especially in the absence of 
articulated knowledge of what a moral 

371
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,574
structure is,
it's a perfectly reasonable way to 

372
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:58,824
represent it.

373
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,903
So that happened.
So the Israelites are trying to orient 

374
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,514
themselves on this trip.
They don't know what the hell you're 

375
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,643
doing.
And then another thing happens that's 

376
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,610
quite interesting is that,
well,

377
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,444
they're all squabbling among each other.
Now I want to tell you a story about 

378
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,010
that.
So among the,

379
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,200
uh,
bushmen,

380
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,663
the Kalahari Bushman,
who by the way look to be the most 

381
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,594
genetically similar of all human beings,
to what our earliest relatives would 

382
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,050
have been who moved out of Africa.
It's something like that.

383
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:28,884
So that's kind of interesting.
The Kalahari Bushmen are very 

384
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:36,450
egalitarian society and people like to 
think that egalitarian societies,

385
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,000
because they were Galitary Ian are 
peaceful,

386
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,834
but that's not true at all.
They're not peaceful at all and neither 

387
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,150
is the Bushman society.
And the problem with the bushmen society

388
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:45,984
is,
is that,

389
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,530
let's say art and whole,
Ah,

390
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,760
you know,
you still my wife,

391
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,950
okay,
well there's no hierarchy.

392
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,950
So what am I going to do about that?
There's no authority to appeal to,

393
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,320
so I'm stuck with it.
So what am I going to do?

394
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,423
Well,
often I'm just going to wait around 

395
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,930
until I get my chance and then I'm going
to take out my little bow and Arrow with

396
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,040
a poisoned Arrow and I'm going to nail 
you with it because what else is there?

397
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,540
There's no authority.
Now,

398
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,840
this is what the Bushman do,
very interesting is that there's another

399
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:17,290
tribe located near them and I think it's
the band too,

400
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,153
but I'm not absolutely certain,
but I think it's the band and they have 

401
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:21,394
a hierarchical structure.
So there is an authority and so now the 

402
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:24,904
Bushman,
we'll go to the band to to have their 

403
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,310
disputes mediated so they don't just 
have to shoot each other when,

404
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,330
when they have an argument.
So it's,

405
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,230
it's quite interesting.

406
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,500
It's we're thinking about because in a 
flat egalitarianism society,

407
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,543
nobody has the final word and when 
everyone's getting along that's 

408
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,220
perfectly fine,
but as soon as two people aren't getting

409
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,390
along,
it's like,

410
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,230
who do we turn to to mediate this?
Okay.

411
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,860
So the Israelites had that problem in 
the archetypal story.

412
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:51,694
And so what happens in relationship to 
Moses is that every time to Israelites 

413
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,420
have some squawk about who's chicken is,
who's.

414
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,643
They have to come to Moses and they pour
out their tale of woe and he has to sit 

415
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:04,534
there and listen to it.
And then he has to decide who's right 

416
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,040
now.
So he's serving as a judge.

417
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,200
Now you've got to think,
what are you doing when you're judging,

418
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,610
which is a word that's all.
You know.

419
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,271
People say,
well,

420
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,280
don't judge me.
It's like,

421
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,993
really?
It's like that's the same as not 

422
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,064
thinking.

423
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,933
You know,
judging is actually an extraordinarily 

424
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,334
useful ability because it helps you 
separate out what isn't good for 

425
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:31,510
anything from what's valuable.
It's like it isn't absence of judgment.

426
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,390
You want.
It's it's judicial judgment,

427
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,950
right?
Principled judgment.

428
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,870
And then you might say,
well what is that?

429
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,610
Well,
that's a good question.

430
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,531
You could say,
well,

431
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,590
it's all arbitrary anyways.
Well then you've just got chaos.

432
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:46,330
So that's not much of a solution.
Okay.

433
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,460
So the Israelites are coming to Moses 
like nonstop bitching about these little

434
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:55,060
trivial things that are aggravating them
to death and he's sitting there like for

435
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,740
years,
literally for years,

436
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,010
listening to them like 14 hours a day 
and finally he does miss it so long that

437
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:03,664
I think it's his father in law who tells
him he has to stop and distribute the 

438
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:08,980
responsibility because he's just going 
to get exhausted.

439
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,010
But you can imagine what happens to you 
if you sit there and judge and judge and

440
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:16,084
judge and judge and judge and judge and 
judge is that you're building up a very 

441
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:20,824
articulated and differentiated 
representation of the moral structure 

442
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,070
that actually constitutes your society.

443
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,460
Because imagine if you're a good judge,
here's what has to happen.

444
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,960
You two are at each other's throats,
like in a really homicidal way,

445
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,943
so things have gone too far and so then 
I have to listen to you both and I have 

446
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:41,704
to decide what you're going to do,
but I have to do something even more 

447
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,030
spectacular than that.
I have to decided in a way that you both

448
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:50,864
feel is more acceptable than killing 
each other and that means you have to 

449
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:55,604
feel that not only is it is it 
reasonable and just it also has to 

450
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:01,544
absolve you of your responsibility to 
seek revenge because that's one of the 

451
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:07,180
functions of law that people never think
about.

452
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,100
It's like if someone.
You may not remember this because you're

453
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:10,934
all young,
but when Michael Dukakis I'm hoping was 

454
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:18,821
running for president,
somebody asked him what he would do.

455
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,770
They were having it Republicans.
He was a democrat.

456
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,173
He had.
He had let some character out of jail 

457
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:25,694
and he went and killed someone and so 
the Republicans made a big deal out of 

458
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:33,870
that during the presidential convention 
and maybe there isn't a rape involved as

459
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,723
possible.
He was asked on tv what he would do if 

460
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,130
his own wife was raped,
you know,

461
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:40,964
which is pretty good question and do 
cactus blue the answer because he w he 

462
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,500
kind of wishy washy did way,
you know,

463
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,350
so the right answer is with every fiber 
of my being,

464
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:56,351
I'd like to chop them into bits,
but as a civilized person I'm willing to

465
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,704
defer that to the judicial system 
because they'll take appropriate and 

466
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,314
measured steps and then my proclivity 
won't generate itself through the 

467
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:09,974
community because the danger is if I 
take vicious revenge that that'll start 

468
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,384
a cycle of revenge and then the whole 
thing falls apart and so it's the 

469
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:17,864
judicial system's responsibility to take
that moral burden off my shoulders 

470
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,634
because you know what's the right 
response when someone you love this 

471
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:27,260
terribly hurt,
we'll it's not,

472
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,330
well,
I'll just forget about that and go home.

473
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,163
It's like that's what you do.
If your contempt to billy week 

474
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,434
fundamentally,
so the judicial system has to stand in 

475
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:36,980
for you.
So anyways,

476
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:37,814
the point is if you make a judgment,
the judgment won't hold unless it suits 

477
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,870
the people who are being judged and it's
not going to suit them unless it matches

478
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,190
the implicit moral presuppositions that 
they're already bringing to the dispute.

479
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,880
Now you see this in kids,
you know the kids will be arguing over a

480
00:25:55,881 --> 00:26:00,050
toy and then they'll come to the mother 
or the father and they'll say,

481
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,620
and then the mother will say,
well,

482
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,500
you do this and you do this,
and if the kids don't like that,

483
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,251
they'll go,
well,

484
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,200
that's not fair.
And kids like,

485
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,080
they're really,
they're really obsessed with fair.

486
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,020
They want exactly fair in an 
understandable way.

487
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,550
So the parent not only has to adjudicate
the dispute,

488
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,384
but the parent has to adjudicate the 
dispute in a manner that the children 

489
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,290
will accept.

490
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,290
Or they'll just go back into the other 
room and have the fight all over again.

491
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,670
Right?
Or they'll poke each other.

492
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,563
You know,
there'll be,

493
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,960
there'll be tit for tat revenge going on
nonstop.

494
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,063
So what that means is that the 
articulated representation of the 

495
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:41,801
solution has to match the embodied 
expectation of the population.

496
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,840
So there's already a morality that's 
governing their interactions.

497
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,940
They just don't know what it is.
If there wasn't,

498
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,160
they wouldn't even know when they had 
been wronged.

499
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,560
Right?
Because you can't figure out when you're

500
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,710
wrong,
unless you know when you're not wrong.

501
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,640
So to say,
well I've been wronged means to say,

502
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,680
well,
I don't know what's going on here,

503
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:02,514
but it doesn't seem fair.
And so then Pearl Moses has to look at 

504
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,260
that and he has to think about it and he
has to think,

505
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:10,680
well why is this fair and why is it 
unfair and who is right here?

506
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,603
And then what's the solution?
And the story represents him as doing 

507
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,424
that for the $10,000,
it would take someone to become an 

508
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:20,340
absolute expert at doing it.
Well then the story,

509
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,760
what the story essentially relates is 
the revelation of a moral code.

510
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,200
And that's the Ten Commandments,
right?

511
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,040
Think,
well,

512
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,380
they say the 10 commandments came from 
God.

513
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,230
Well that's fine.
We kind of have an idea about God that's

514
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,000
already stemming from the bottom 
picture,

515
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,240
so it's the abstract representation of 
what constitutes the source of authority

516
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:39,294
across time.
That's a perfectly reasonable way of 

517
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,140
thinking about it.
And Moses,

518
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,470
he has this bright revelation which is 
like a moment of insight.

519
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,550
Now what happens in psychotherapy when 
you have a moment of insight is that you

520
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:51,384
figure out what you've already,
that you figure out what you're already 

521
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:55,704
doing.
That's what happens because you come to 

522
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,680
the therapist and you say,
look,

523
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,470
I had this relationship and this is how 
it went.

524
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,030
Then,
uh,

525
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,863
this relationship and it went the same 
way and this relationship and it went 

526
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:07,410
the same way.
What's going on?

527
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:08,244
And so then you talk about it and you 
talk about it and talk about it until 

528
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,700
all of a sudden bang,
you think,

529
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,623
ah,
here's the explanation that maps onto 

530
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:18,150
the behavior and it feels like a fit.
Right?

531
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,890
And that's the insight moment.
It's like,

532
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,063
well,
I got it.

533
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,760
And it's interesting because if you,
you know,

534
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,520
I do dream interpretation fairly 
regularly and you know,

535
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,383
you think,
well that's kind of like astrology and 

536
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,893
you know it,
that's a perfectly reasonable objection 

537
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,080
except that it's more like literary 
interpretation and you think,

538
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:37,914
well,
how do you know when you've got it 

539
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,650
right?
And the answer is,

540
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,100
well,
it's an insight like you,

541
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,190
you talk about it and all of a sudden it
sort of crystallizes the person goes,

542
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:48,700
oh yeah,
that fits go.

543
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,500
I've got it.
How you figure that out.

544
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:57,030
I don't really understand.
I think I don't get it exactly.

545
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,000
I think it's something like when you 
get,

546
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,893
when you get the map right,
what happens is that there's an 

547
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,780
understanding of how that generalizes 
across situations.

548
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,210
And so partly that simplifies the 
problem,

549
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,021
you know,
you say,

550
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:13,950
well here's the rule instead of having 
to act it out on stage.

551
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,430
And I think the reason that that would 
come with a,

552
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,303
with a burst of insight is because it's 
simpler and more efficient and so your 

553
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,730
body recognize it,
right?

554
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,813
Recognizes it as an optimal solution.
And I think it also opens up new 

555
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:31,290
possibilities for the future and I think
that gives you a dopamine kick.

556
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,573
And so that's why it's.
That's why that moment of insight is 

557
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:40,080
associated with this really potent and 
effective marker.

558
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,630
And that's a revelation when you have a 
moment of insight.

559
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,360
It's a revelation.
The people even say that.

560
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,330
Now we might not think anymore that it's
a divine revelation,

561
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:54,220
but I will tell you if you had a 
revelation of sufficient magnitude,

562
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,760
so maybe it was one way up in your 
abstraction hierarchy,

563
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,953
if you had a revelation at that level,
you would describe it as a religious 

564
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,010
experience.
People do all the time.

565
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,010
It's happens to alcoholics all the time 
when their recovery,

566
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,203
you know they have a flash of insight 
and that's when a new personality gets 

567
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:15,190
catalyzed and if that happens to them,
sometimes they can stop drinking.

568
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,710
It's the best.
Now,

569
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:20,620
maybe this is outdated because I knew 
the literature 25 years ago,

570
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:21,454
but I doubt it because we haven't made 
really any progress in treating 

571
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:27,310
alcoholics,
revelatory,

572
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,780
personality,
transformation,

573
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:29,860
cures,
alcoholism.

574
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,320
Now we don't know necessarily know how 
to bring in about,

575
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,154
but you know,
the 12 step programs try to bring it 

576
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,010
about.
So.

577
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,810
Okay.
So you can think about all that.

578
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,613
There's a,
there's a bigger representation of the 

579
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,330
picture.
So that's authority.

580
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,640
What is authority?
Well,

581
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:49,450
there's a now I'm hoping it's been a 
while since I looked at these pictures.

582
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm hoping that picture

583
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,030
at that.
I think that picture is a way.

584
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,873
I think it's good step duray and I think
that's Moses receiving the tablets from 

585
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,630
God,
but I might be wrong,

586
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:05,690
but I think that's what it is.
And there's light to associate.

587
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:06,524
Yep.

588
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,143
What

589
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,960
they just didn't know that they knew it.

590
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,470
They didn't know what to do

591
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,520
or even necessarily why they'd been 
wronged.

592
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,160
They just have a sense that this wasn't 
right.

593
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,350
And that's.
I think the best way to think about that

594
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:31,430
is to think about five-year-olds.
They know when somebody breaks a rule,

595
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,220
but they don't know what to do about it.
That bug really bugs them.

596
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:37,100
That's a phd and observation too.
You're not playing by the rules.

597
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,160
That's enough to make many young kids 
cry.

598
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,503
Right,
and when they're crying and you think 

599
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:44,960
what happens when you're crying,
while it's a distress call,

600
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,273
that's it's an.
It's a request for the intervention of 

601
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:51,500
authority.
That's what crying is,

602
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,083
so the kid knows something's gone wrong.
His pattern detection system is not 

603
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:57,524
sophisticated,
but his capacity to represent that and 

604
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,664
articulate it well from a Ph,
Eddie and perspective that doesn't come 

605
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,900
until multiple stages of development 
later,

606
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,734
like the highest level of development 
and lots of people according to Piaget 

607
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:10,820
don't even get there.

608
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,630
Right,
and that would be the ability to to play

609
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:15,464
games with the rules of games and so you
do that when you were having a 

610
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:19,844
constitutional discussion for example,
or maybe when you're talking with your 

611
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:24,254
friends on the playing field about what 
the rules are going to be for a pickup 

612
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:27,944
football game.
So you're so you can conceptualize 

613
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:31,934
yourself at that point as not only a 
thing that is good because that thing 

614
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:39,050
can follow rules,
which is an earlier stage of,

615
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,783
but that as a thing that's good because 
not only can it follow rules that can 

616
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,504
abstractly represent the rules,
it can engage in a discussion about the 

617
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,224
rules and I can update them and I would 
say that's part of what's being 

618
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:52,214
represented by this picture on the left.
So the father is the thing that's the 

619
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:56,294
rules and the son in this representation
is the thing that can update the rules 

620
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,150
now it has to die and come back in order
to update the rules.

621
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,283
And so that's partly why the the father 
in that figure is holding a cross 

622
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,160
because the cross is a symbol of death 
and reconstruction.

623
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,023
That's the price you pay for 
reformatting the rules because you have 

624
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,950
to do that to yourself too.
So Yep.

625
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,863
Value in the extraction is not to play 
the game which actually pay attention 

626
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,214
to.

627
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,863
Well it's,
it's exactly the advantage of abstract 

628
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,134
representation.
You can start to manipulate the 

629
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:39,120
representations before you manipulate 
the thing.

630
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,880
So that means you can start to think 
about morality.

631
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,890
Now,
is that a good thing?

632
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,660
Well,
I think it was Alfred North Whitehead.

633
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,523
I hate taping these because all these 
errors that I'm making in my memory 

634
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,130
going to be preserved.
But anyways,

635
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:57,960
I think it was Alfred North Whitehead 
who said something like,

636
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,453
the reason to think the reason that 
thought is valuable is because we can 

637
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:07,060
let our thoughts die instead of 
ourselves.

638
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,621
Right?
And so,

639
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:09,431
so then you think,
well,

640
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:12,010
once you can lay out the rules,
okay,

641
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,453
yeah,

642
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,960
the kids are playing a game.
One kid cheats or,

643
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,650
or another kid suspects the first kid is
cheated and there's,

644
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,470
there's no adults around.
So what,

645
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,300
what's the outcome?
Well,

646
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:31,250
one outcome is the game stops.
That's a high probability outcome or the

647
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,084
game continues,
but no one's having any fun or one kid 

648
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:38,390
gets resentful and Solomon and the other
kid just oppose,

649
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,420
imposes his will or they fight.
That's it.

650
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:44,294
Those are the options.
Now when they can abstractly represent 

651
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:48,830
the rules,
first of all,

652
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:52,550
they can agree on them before they play 
the game and kids do that automatically.

653
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,790
So if for example,
if you watch kids play pretend games,

654
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,193
what they do first,
you can probably all remember this from 

655
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,110
when you were little kids.
If you're,

656
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,710
you're playing some pretend game in a 
blanket fort or something.

657
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,590
Maybe you get together with all the 
other kids and you think,

658
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:07,424
okay,
well this is your role in this is your 

659
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:12,680
role and that's your role and you know,
and here's what we're going to do.

660
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,140
Here's going to be the little drama will
lay out.

661
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,730
Some kids are very good at that.
Once you can get the rules abstracted,

662
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,970
you can talk about the damn things 
instead of having to kill each other and

663
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:23,804
you can also update them in principle,
run simulations of what would happen 

664
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,194
with the update,
which is basically what an argument is 

665
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,190
or a debate and then you can implement 
them.

666
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:35,024
And so hopefully you can get rid of the 
stupid updates before you actually 

667
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,480
implement them and die because you 
implemented them.

668
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,973
And so the other advantage to 
abstraction either in drama or in 

669
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:51,621
articulation is that you can transfer 
the rules more or more efficiently.

670
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,210
So you can get the kid to act out the 
rule,

671
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,044
but you can also say here's the rule and
you should follow it in multiple 

672
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,751
situations and then they don't have to 
learn purely through imitation to embody

673
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,640
that rule across all possible 
situations.

674
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,030
So whatever advantages abstraction has,
the pulling out of the more rural system

675
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:15,510
from the underlying behavior has those 
advantages and disadvantages.

676
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:16,344
The disadvantages,
while you can come up with a perfectly 

677
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:19,974
good reason why you shouldn't keep doing
what your forefathers have done for 20 

678
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,950
centuries,
you know,

679
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,910
because it doesn't make any sense.
Well it does.

680
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:28,350
You just don't know why.
And you know,

681
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,170
you can easily.
It's like the Mesopotamians last week we

682
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,004
were talking about,
remember the noisy God's killed app 

683
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,404
suit.
I didn't know what the hell he was good 

684
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:38,720
for.
It's like,

685
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,740
you know,
he's there shield against chaos.

686
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,210
He's their tradition.
It's like,

687
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,340
well we'll just kill them and see what 
happens.

688
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,174
It's like,
you better be careful because lurking 

689
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:47,994
behind your tradition is chaos.
And you know you might be the master of 

690
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:52,710
chaos,
but you're probably not.

691
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,603
So look out now,
we got some clue from the Mesopotamians 

692
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,610
what the master of chaos was like.

693
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,473
The master of chaos was a new kind of 
God who had eyes all the way around his 

694
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:06,750
head who could speak magic words.
So there's a.

695
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,613
there's an attention verbalization 
communication element to that and the 

696
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:14,490
Mesopotamians figured out that thing 
should be at the top.

697
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,090
Now that's it's.
It's.

698
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,700
It's staggering insight to think that 
because it also might be right.

699
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:21,534
It's like,
okay,

700
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,540
what should you follow?
Well,

701
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,790
the first answer is follow the damn 
rules.

702
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,050
Why?
Well,

703
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:28,884
because that's what people expect and 
you won't get into too much trouble if 

704
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,090
you do that.
But then you might say,

705
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,460
well,
sometimes the rules are wrong,

706
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,740
or sometimes they don't apply.
Okay,

707
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,930
that's definitely true.
Then what?

708
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
Well that's a whole different issue.
Well,

709
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,610
in the Mesopotamians would say that's a 
really good time to pay attention and to

710
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:48,444
confront the chaos voluntarily and to 
communicate about what you're doing and 

711
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:52,884
to reformat the world,
restructure the world as a consequence 

712
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,750
of your confrontation with this chaos.

713
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,390
And that's,
that's a higher daddy.

714
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,090
And I think it's the god of attention,
fundamentally.

715
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,590
It's something like that,
but it's more,

716
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,130
it's attention plus articulation plus 
communication.

717
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,563
And that would be the highest.
So the Mesopotamians would say that's 

718
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:14,400
the highest God.
It's a hypothesis.

719
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,390
So to the degree now I wanted to tell 
you the rest of the Mesopotamian story.

720
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,373
So cool.
So you remember that Margaret goes off 

721
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,850
and conquers tire.
Matt puts it into net,

722
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,330
cuts it into pieces,
makes the world okay.

723
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:28,164
And then out of Time Matt has organized 
this army to go against Marduk and his 

724
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,930
and his and and his army.
And what time does,

725
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,360
when she goes out to have a war is she's
at the forefront.

726
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,783
No,
she sort of behind the scenes 

727
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,090
maneuvering and manipulating everything.
And she puts,

728
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,760
she creates this like all sorts of 
monsters.

729
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,850
The worst monster she can think up and 
then have all those monsters.

730
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,683
She picks the worst possible monster and
she puts him at the head of the Phalanx 

731
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,920
that goes into battle and his name is 
king.

732
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,960
And so martin defeats him too.
So he's like a,

733
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,140
he's a bit of a precursor of Satan.
He's like,

734
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,420
he's a,
he's the agent of chaos,

735
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,000
but he's more embodied,
you know.

736
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,323
Anyways,
Martik makes human beings out of the 

737
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,294
blood of king new,
which is also extraordinarily 

738
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:16,264
interesting idea,
but it's very much like the idea in 

739
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,103
genesis that was picked up particularly 
by the Catholics that human beings are 

740
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,900
characterized by original sin,
right?

741
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,180
We're made out of the blood of the worst
monster,

742
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,030
and I took me a long time to think that 
through.

743
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:31,990
I thought,
what the hell?

744
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:32,530
Why,
why,

745
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,363
why would they think that?
And I think the reason is is that 

746
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:40,651
because human beings are the only things
on the planet that can deceive you,

747
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,220
right?

748
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Like everything else is either the way 
it is or you just don't understand it.

749
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,680
It's not like the garbage can.
He isn't trying to deceive you.

750
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,040
There's things about it you don't 
understand like at subatomic structure,

751
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,550
but it's not actively fighting against 
your comprehension.

752
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,610
Whereas human beings,
there are completely different creatures

753
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:01,444
and it's definitely the case that along 
with our capacity for abstraction and 

754
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:05,884
self consciousness,
we immediately evolved the ability for 

755
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:12,670
high level intrigue and deception and 
even see that in kids,

756
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,683
the smarter the kid,
the earlier they learn to lie and you 

757
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:17,680
can see that's,
that's.

758
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,543
You can't separate that from the 
capacity to spin off alternative 

759
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,520
simulated worlds because that's what a 
lie is,

760
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,320
except if you're doing it in a 
normalized manner,

761
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,163
you're trying to spin off a world that 
actually represents the real world 

762
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:32,944
better instead of trying to spin off a 
simulation that allows you to avoid 

763
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,530
responsibility for something.

764
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,320
So I think that.
So it's interesting that you know,

765
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,154
the Mesopotamians also,
we're very cognizant of the fact that 

766
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,604
there is something in human beings which
was fundamentally the capacity for 

767
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,234
deceitful and evil auction.
That was also something that really has 

768
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,073
to be contended with,
but they also assumed that Marduk was 

769
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,890
the master of that.
So that's pretty cool.

770
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,880
It was very implicit in the story.
So what happens?

771
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,420
So the,
the emperor,

772
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,493
so the emperor lived in a walled city 
because cities were world at that time 

773
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:10,420
and the reason for that was if they 
weren't Walden,

774
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,283
the marauding barbarians would come in 
and kill all the men and take all the 

775
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:16,270
women and burned the place to the ground
and steal everything.

776
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,553
So you know,
people weren't all that happy when that 

777
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,104
happens.
So they built big walls to make sure 

778
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:22,570
that that was difficult.

779
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,280
So that was order inside the walls and 
chaos outside and chaos was out were the

780
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:29,920
barbarians are,
which is still what we think.

781
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,113
But what would happen to the emperor,
the New Year's ceremony was that they 

782
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:39,800
would take them outside the city wall.
So they take the emperor who's like king

783
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:40,634
of order,
they take them outside into chaos to 

784
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,370
remind them that even the emperor could,
is,

785
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,204
is,
uh,

786
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,123
is surrounded by chaos.
So then they strip them of all the 

787
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,470
clothing and symbols that made him 
emperor and they'd make a meal.

788
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,910
And then the priest would make him 
recount for the last year.

789
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,460
All the things he did that made him not 
a good mark.

790
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,253
So he was supposed to embody Martin,
that was what made him the emperor to 

791
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,174
the degree that he could embody the 
attentive and communicated forest that 

792
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:17,060
could keep chaos at bay.
He deserved to be emperor.

793
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,970
So that was.
So that's the idea of sovereignty,

794
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,370
right?
Of lawful sovereignty.

795
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,170
It's a brilliant.
It's brilliant.

796
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,453
They take him.
Now the problem is is the emperor might 

797
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:29,390
forget that he's supposed to be Marduk 
and he might just be,

798
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:30,224
you know,
guy with the biggest heroin who's 

799
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,144
stealing everything he possibly can,
which is really not what he's supposed 

800
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:35,414
to be doing.
So they take them outside at the New 

801
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,130
Year's festival when the world was going
to be renewed,

802
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,510
which we still do,
right?

803
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,270
Because it's out with the old year.
And with the new,

804
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,800
that's when you make your resolutions to
be a better person.

805
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,810
Right?
So this is an ancient ceremony.

806
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,670
Okay,
out you take the emperor,

807
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,630
strip him of his emperor close.
So now he's just some dude.

808
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,643
You have a kneeling there and then 
you'll walk them with a glove to just 

809
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:02,990
remind him that he's not boss of 
everything.

810
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,440
And then you get them to recount all his
sins basically,

811
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,483
but the sins were okay in the last year,
how did you fail in your task as a 

812
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,094
representative of Martech on earth?
And so then the emperor hypothetically 

813
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:22,070
would tell everybody why he was allowed 
to and useless in six different ways and

814
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:22,904
promise to be better.
And then the Mesopotamians would take 

815
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:29,240
statues out of the city that represented
the gods that we've talked about,

816
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,080
and they would reenact the battle of 
Marduk against chaos.

817
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:34,220
They,
they'd act that out.

818
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:39,330
And then at the end the emperor would 
sleep with a ritual prostitute like.

819
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,244
So she'd be like a temple virgin 
representing the benevolent element of 

820
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,750
femininity.
And then then they'd go back in and have

821
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:48,584
their year start.
Now it's very much like St George and 

822
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:51,740
the Dragon,
if you think about it,

823
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:53,690
right?
You know the Saint George and the Dragon

824
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,770
Story.
St George Goes,

825
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,090
a dragon has captured a virgin and St 
George is out there.

826
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,890
He's going to slay the dragon and free 
the virgin.

827
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,400
And that works at multiple levels of 
analysis simultaneously.

828
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,234
One level is the guy who's best at 
keeping chaos at bay is going to be the 

829
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,470
guy who was most attractive to women 
because women are smart,

830
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,603
so that's first.
That's like the architectural level or 

831
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,260
that.
That's sorry.

832
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,123
That's the biological level.
The architectural level is even more 

833
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:24,780
abstract.
It's that the dragon tie,

834
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,633
Matt is a representation of chaos itself
and chaos is something that's deeply 

835
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:30,944
informative,
so the dragon has gold or it has a 

836
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:36,150
virgin.
Depends on how the story works out.

837
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,553
When you encountered that,
you free something of value and that's 

838
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,360
something that you can.
You can incorporate,

839
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,480
you can have.
That's more like the treasure variant of

840
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,314
the story.
It's also good if you kind of spread it 

841
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:51,750
around a little bit so because otherwise
it's an incomplete story.

842
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,040
Okay,
so what's happening?

843
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,120
What's happening in Mesopotamia at that 
time,

844
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,250
his many,
many tribes are being brought together.

845
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,030
They've all got their own mythology and 
everyone's trying to figure out,

846
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:03,864
okay,
how do we benefit from the fact that 

847
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,470
we're all going to live together without
having to kill each other?

848
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,380
Which is the standard human problem,
right?

849
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:11,214
Because it's good to cooperate,
but you don't want the foreigners upset 

850
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:14,840
and you're,
you're,

851
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:17,900
you're,
you're a horse cart and,

852
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,480
and you don't want the whole thing 
collapsing into chaos.

853
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:22,314
So how do you balance that?
So what you could imagine Eliana called 

854
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:25,974
this the war of the Gods in heaven,
which is a very common mythological 

855
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,330
motif.
So you can imagine,

856
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:31,164
if you will,
all these tribes have their own culture 

857
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,210
and their own representation of that 
culture.

858
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:39,720
Often in mythological stories,
they're brought together.

859
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,300
Where does the war take place?

860
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,123
Well,
if it doesn't take place between the 

861
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,433
people,
which is what will happen if they can't 

862
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:49,064
cooperate,
it's going to take place between the 

863
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:53,460
representations.
So what's happening is,

864
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,383
you know,
culture has got a story and culture be 

865
00:45:55,661 --> 00:45:58,920
he's got a story and the story's kind of
are the same and they're kind of not the

866
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,870
same.
And so you think,

867
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,220
well then everybody thinks,
well,

868
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,960
you've got your God,
and I've got mine.

869
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:04,490
It's like,
who?

870
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,060
Who,
who,

871
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,140
who are we going to pay any attention to
here?

872
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,300
And one answer is,
well,

873
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,980
just kill you.
And that'll be the end of the problem.

874
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:14,340
My God wins.
Or another issue would be,

875
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:15,174
well,
we'll just let everything drop into 

876
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:16,944
chaos,
which in some sense I think is what 

877
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:18,894
happened to Rome.
It just ate so many gods can no longer 

878
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,744
survive.
Or we're going to figure out how to get 

879
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:25,950
along together.

880
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,000
Well that means your story in my story 
have to be brought together.

881
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,560
So they're commensurate.
Now,

882
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:36,561
one of the things that's quite 
interesting is that you can actually see

883
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:40,290
this happening in,
in the oldest books in the Bible.

884
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,520
So the Bible is a collection of books,
right?

885
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,773
And there's a lot of books that were 
sort of Bible like that didn't get into 

886
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:53,361
the final version when people were 
arguing about which should be in an inch

887
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,383
in what order.
So the books were written and there's 

888
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:57,414
huge arguments about what should be 
included and what shouldn't and what 

889
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:00,204
sequence they should be included in.
And these arguments went over thousands 

890
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,530
of years,
is that major legal arguments.

891
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,830
But if you go into the,
into genesis for example,

892
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,050
and you look at the story of Adam and 
Eve,

893
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,603
what you find is it's not one story,
it's at least two and maybe three and 

894
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:17,903
that's been identified through 
psycholinguistic analysis and also 

895
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,530
through anthropological investigation.

896
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,363
And so there's version one and there's 
version two and then the guy they call 

897
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:30,790
the redactor,
he was a hypothetical character,

898
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,720
organize these stories,
cut them apart and sequenced them,

899
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,780
tried to keep both in some order that 
made sense.

900
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:38,614
And so what he was basically doing was 
taking two traditions whose stories had 

901
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,110
some archetipal similarity,
but who's,

902
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,153
who's details deferred and he's trying 
to make them logically coherent so they 

903
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,420
can fit together.
And you think,

904
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:50,860
well,
why is he doing that?

905
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,853
Well,
the answer is we either get our stories 

906
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:56,350
together or you're a slave and I'm a 
tyrant,

907
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:58,870
or the reverse,
or we kill each other.

908
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,850
Those are the options.
Well,

909
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,980
apart from pure descend into chaos,
which is,

910
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,133
you know,
not going to do either of us any good 

911
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:05,824
either.
That's kind of a nihilism and it's a 

912
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:10,840
real threat to human societies.
So that's pretty cool.

913
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,130
So the war between the Gods in the 
heavens is something like this.

914
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:19,240
It's like the top left hand 
representation is too simple.

915
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,000
We know that because when you're doing 
something it isn't.

916
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,830
When you're going from point a to point 
B and you act that out because sometimes

917
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:28,930
you're working at a much more abstract 
level,

918
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,183
you might say,
well I'm trying to do well at 

919
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:32,704
university.
Well how do you move your body to 

920
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:40,300
accomplish that will now answer is 
that's the wrong level of resolution.

921
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:41,134
To answer that question,
you'd go trying to do well in 

922
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:44,440
university.
Okay.

923
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,390
How do you subdivide that?

924
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,790
I take five classes.
Okay,

925
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,683
fine.
Now you got subdivided down to five 

926
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:55,160
classes.
I do the readings in each class.

927
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:57,320
So that's getting closer to behavior,
right?

928
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:58,963
How do you do the readings?
Well I opened the book and I moved my 

929
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:01,971
eyes.
Right.

930
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:03,710
So then you get.
Then you're down to a high,

931
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,530
low resolution level of.
Of Representation.

932
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,520
But so when you look at the thing on the
top left,

933
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:12,260
it's really more like the thing in the 
middle.

934
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,933
It's nested,
it's nested value orientations that 

935
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:21,890
ground out in action and how those are 
going to be nested.

936
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:22,724
Exactly.
That's either war discussion that that 

937
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,060
determines that war thought or 
discussion.

938
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,500
That's it.
That's what you've got,

939
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:34,280
and if you can't do it with the first 
two thought and discussion,

940
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,833
the only recourse you have is war or the
degeneration indicates which will 

941
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:41,714
produce war anyways,
so and then there's a further 

942
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:45,464
transformation is which is well,
if I could do any of these three things 

943
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:55,980
to further my move forward,
which takes priority.

944
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,023
Now you're solving that problem all the 
time or you can't act and sometimes 

945
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:03,210
you'll actually see this in yourself.
You know sometimes,

946
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,833
okay,

947
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,693
if you're driving somewhere,
you're not sure whether you're going to 

948
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:08,760
go straight or go left.
You kind of go,

949
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,300
you flip between them.
You know in confusion.

950
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,440
Well,
you're not gonna go anywhere.

951
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:14,274
If you're doing that,
you have to make one more important the 

952
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:17,004
other than before you can act.
And so whenever you're undertaking any 

953
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:20,634
action,
what you've done is organize the whole 

954
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:23,154
hierarchy of values so that there's no 
contradictions at the level you're 

955
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:28,670
operating or you're frozen.
And so you're making value judgments all

956
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:29,630
the time.
And you know,

957
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:30,464
this is like,
should you go to the library or should 

958
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:34,040
you read your book at home,
you know,

959
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,740
or maybe you shouldn't you be studying 
for that course or this course,

960
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,740
you know,
or when you're really feeling desperate,

961
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,053
should you be in that discipline or 
should you be in university or should 

962
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,070
you be alive,
right?

963
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,110
That's when you should visit very 
seldomly.

964
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,780
No,
you want the local problem to,

965
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,940
to,
to,

966
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,540
to dominate that.
That's.

967
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,770
Well,
if,

968
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,623
if things have got very disorganized,
you're going to go all the way to the 

969
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:57,891
top.
You know,

970
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,080
it's very,
very hard on people to do that.

971
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,100
So societies have to get their 
priorities straight,

972
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,670
which is their value hierarchies and 
individuals do to.

973
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:12,020
And then if you're looking at how that 
happens over the historical timespan,

974
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,370
you're going to think good.
So battle of gods of the gods and habit,

975
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,460
that's the higher.
And that is what happens.

976
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:21,250
It's the right way of thinking about it.
If,

977
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:22,084
if,
if,

978
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,170
if,
if,

979
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,073
if there is a transpersonal space,
that's the imagination in which these 

980
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,180
longterm discussions in battles take 
place.

981
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,530
You have to represent that somehow.
So human would think about that at least

982
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:43,970
in part is the collective unconscious 
and the collective unconscious is.

983
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,403
Here's one way of thinking about it.
The collective unconscious is all those 

984
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,250
behavioral patterns and presuppositions 
that we share.

985
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,590
What are those?
Well,

986
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:55,960
we don't know.
We,

987
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,220
right?
We don't have a full account of that.

988
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,010
We're trying to figure it out.
So.

989
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,203
Okay.
So these are different representations 

990
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:06,650
of this.
So the one on the left,

991
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,693
at the top,
there's another representation of what 

992
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:11,560
constitutes authority.
There's the,

993
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,453
there's God the father,
you see these kind of got a little 

994
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:15,560
pyramid hat on,
which I think is quite cool.

995
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,960
And it also,
I think helps explain why the damn Egypt

996
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,350
shins were so obsessed with pyramids.
You know,

997
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,550
it's a,
it's a,

998
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,530
it's a hierarchical structure up here at
Mit.

999
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,750
And they thought about that as something
sacred.

1000
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,260
And there is something sacred about a 
hierarchical structure.

1001
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,990
The question is what's the structure and
how should it be structured?

1002
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,213
So there's God with his little pyramid 
hat and then in front of them he's got 

1003
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:40,580
across and I think that's in an orb that
represents the world.

1004
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,713
And then in front of that there's a dove
and the dove is the third part of the 

1005
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,230
Christian Trinity and the dove 
represents the Holy Spirit.

1006
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,064
And the Holy Spirit hypothetically is 
you might think about it as the action 

1007
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:56,180
of conscience.
It's something like that.

1008
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:01,390
It's the manifestation of tradition and 
the capacity to date tradition in you.

1009
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,063
So there's a personal element to it.
So and that's why the dove is a thing 

1010
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:10,970
that communicates between the heavenly 
realms and the earthly realm.

1011
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,830
Fundamentally,
something like that.

1012
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,900
Now you see that on the American dollar 
bill,

1013
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,390
that's pretty cool because what they've 
done there,

1014
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,940
same kind of idea except the top of the 
pyramid is detached from the bottom,

1015
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,863
which I really love because what it's.
It's making this claim that the thing 

1016
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:30,540
that's at the top of the pyramid isn't 
part of the pyramid.

1017
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,710
And that's bloody brilliant and I think 
that that's an observation.

1018
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,050
The Egyptians first,
God right,

1019
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,530
and we're going to tell that story here 
in a minute.

1020
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,783
It's that.

1021
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,420
Think about it this way.
We'll go back to the game idea.

1022
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,080
Your kids playing hockey and you say,

1023
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,860
be a good sport now.
Then the question would be,

1024
00:53:54,861 --> 00:53:57,410
if the pyramid at that point,
is the hockey game,

1025
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,413
if he's a good sport,
does that mean he's going to win the 

1026
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:03,470
hockey game and answer that is no.
It doesn't mean that.

1027
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,723
What it means is that he's going to win 
the game that goes across multiple sets 

1028
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:10,970
of games across very large spans of 
time.

1029
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,430
And so it's not really part of any 
hierarchy.

1030
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,270
It's something that's above them all.
And that's the best game to play.

1031
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,320
So at least that's the theory.
And you know,

1032
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,480
even in that representation,
there's an eye,

1033
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:25,760
it's like pay attention,
pay attention.

1034
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,820
You know,
the Washington monument at the top of it

1035
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:29,950
has a pyramid,
you know,

1036
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,920
and there's a cap on that pyramid and 
the cap is made out of aluminum.

1037
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,143
And you might think,
well why would it be made out of 

1038
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:36,500
aluminum?

1039
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,990
And the answer was when that monument 
was made,

1040
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:39,824
aluminum was the most precious metal on 
the planet because people had just 

1041
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:45,590
figured out how to make it.
So they made this nice cap that was even

1042
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:47,890
more precious than gold.
So what this,

1043
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:48,763
what the symbol is that the thing that's
at the top of the pyramid that isn't 

1044
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:53,960
quite connected to it is more precious 
than gold.

1045
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,110
And that's an l chemical idea too.
And it's right.

1046
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,900
It's right.
It's not a metaphor or it is,

1047
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:04,901
but it's a lot of things we think are 
metaphors aren't,

1048
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,990
they're just descriptions of things at 
our level we don't understand.

1049
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,853
Yep.

1050
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,353
Sacred

1051
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,400
cause it keeps chaos in order.
Properly balanced everywhere.

1052
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:26,680
And we'll get into that more deeply as 
we get into these stories.

1053
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:28,840
It's a very good question.
You know,

1054
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,720
town so that you sort of have to answer 
well,

1055
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:32,554
what constitutes sacred and,
and what I would say is the more 

1056
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:39,130
unshakable a truth,
the more sacred it is.

1057
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,750
Now you might say,
well,

1058
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,660
how do you know if one truth is more 
unshakable than another?

1059
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:44,740
And the answer is,
well,

1060
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,574
you got to figure that out.
And so what I'm presenting as far as I 

1061
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:53,131
can tell is how people have figured that
out over God only knows what's what span

1062
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:57,150
of time.
Like it's 100,

1063
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,013
it's 150,000
years for sure of actually trying to 

1064
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:01,594
figure it out.
And then the dominance hierarchies 

1065
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,840
themselves,
man,

1066
00:56:04,841 --> 00:56:08,290
those things are.
We know there are 400 million years old.

1067
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,080
So we've been working at this for a very
long period of time.

1068
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,603
So now I would say,
well one of the things that sacred 

1069
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,953
roughly speaking is how you keep that 
thing in tact and transforming because 

1070
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:22,894
if it's intact and it just falls apart 
because their environment around it 

1071
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:27,910
changes,
right?

1072
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:30,940
So what the hell good is that you can't 
play the same game forever,

1073
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,390
but you have to play a game.
So how do you do that?

1074
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,241
Well,
that,

1075
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:36,074
that's the question.
That's why I'm going to tell you the 

1076
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:39,070
Egyptian story.
So what time is it?

1077
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,563
This is a good time for break and then 
I'll come you come back and I'll tell 

1078
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,230
you this Egyptian story and it's a great
story.
