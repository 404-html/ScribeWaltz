1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,400
Hi everyone.
So here we are for the first q and a for

2
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,180
2018.
Um,

3
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,480
there's 514 questions lined up.
I don't think I'm going to get to all of

4
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:40,314
them.
So it's been a busy time since the last 

5
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,890
time I did a q and.
A.

6
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,470
Um,
some of you probably know about the,

7
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,304
when Lindsay Shepherd a at Wilfrid 
laurier university where a teaching 

8
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,120
assistant was brought in front of a 
tribunal,

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,303
uh,
because she had the temerity to play a 

10
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:01,311
video where I was discussing bill see 16
on a public television show.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,313
Um,
that's been quite the national and 

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,073
interval national scandal I would say.
And so I made a bit of a video about 

13
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,050
that today,
which I haven't launched yet.

14
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,323
Uh,
contains a message to junior high and 

15
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,920
high school students.
I'm recommending to them that they,

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,900
well,
I guess you'll have to watch the video.

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,223
Um,
I didn't mean to make it a cliffhanger 

18
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:22,854
like that,
but then as soon as I said that I 

19
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,980
thought better of it and thought maybe 
I'll just wait.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,430
But anyways,
let's take a look here.

21
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,383
Steve a has the first question,
how can we know the difference between 

22
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,810
unhealthy repression and healthy self 
restraint of sexuality?

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,910
Well,
I would say,

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,590
you know,
part of what constitutes ethics,

25
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,420
let's say first of all,
let's start,

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,343
let's think about ethics to begin with.
So what's the point of conducting your 

27
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:53,864
life ethically?
The answer to that isn't so that you 

28
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,864
follow the proper rules precisely the,
the answer to that is so that you 

29
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,594
balance your life so that it says 
productive and meaningful as it can 

30
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,584
possibly be.
And that would be productive and 

31
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:08,834
meaningful for you with any luck,
but also for people around you that 

32
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:13,930
would even be better.
And,

33
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,840
and for you now and next week and into 
the future.

34
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,183
So it's sort of a variation of the 
philosopher Emmanuel counts moral 

35
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,864
dictum,
which was act such that your action 

36
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,400
becomes a moral,
a universal,

37
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,080
something like that.
Although I think that it's,

38
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,860
it's better phrased across time and 
across people like that.

39
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,683
Um,
so when you're thinking about an ethic 

40
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,330
that has to do with any fundamental 
motivation like sexuality,

41
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:45,110
you have to think about it in the 
context of the rest of your life.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Um,
the,

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,430
the question is whether or not,
what,

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,840
what did I say?
What,

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,140
what did I read at one point that I 
really liked with regards to sexuality?

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,653
Okay.

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,860
Who's in control?
That's the,

48
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,663
is it you or is it the sexuality that's 
in control is have you integrated your 

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,693
sexual life into the rest of your life 
so that the whole thing makes a 

50
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,894
harmonious balance?
And Are you in charge or is it in 

51
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,800
charge,
so to speak?

52
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:18,640
Because if you're not in charge with 
that harmonious balance,

53
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,474
then things are going to waver wildly 
out of control and you're going to find 

54
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,284
yourself in dreadful trouble.
That happens whenever any given driver 

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,230
me really any given value predominates 
to the exclusion of all else.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,393
Now,
it seems to me that sexuality is best 

57
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,580
handled within the confines of a 
relationship.

58
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,283
Um,
that's the classic ethical solution to 

59
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,704
the problem.
It's because sexuality brings with it a 

60
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,900
tremendous amount of responsibility.
Now,

61
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,734
people don't like to think that,
especially people who I would say are 

62
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,900
low in conscientiousness,
let's say are high in impulsivity.

63
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,790
It's easy for people to believe in,
what would you call it?

64
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,803
Casual sex,
which is not something that I think 

65
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
exists because I don't think you can 
divorce sex from its sociological or 

66
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,900
political or economic or psychological 
consequences.

67
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:11,734
And I would say the endless scandals 
that have plagued the United States in 

68
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,464
particular in the last year with regards
to sexual behavior are proof positive 

69
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,330
that there's no such thing as casual 
sex.

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,100
I think the reason for that is that the 
consequences of sex are too dramatic.

71
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,760
It's not just pregnancy and disease,
let's say,

72
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,280
which are both,
uh,

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,150
as dramatic as consequences can be in 
life,

74
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,370
but also the fact that
there's no disentangling sexual behavior

75
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:48,100
from emotional behavior.
Or maybe you could say even worse if you

76
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,220
try to disentangle your sexual behavior 
from your emotional behavior,

77
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,910
then I think what happens is that you 
end up cold and cynical.

78
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,351
I mean,
if you're,

79
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,320
let's say if you're a a cereal,
if you're us,

80
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,363
uh,
if you have a lot of one night stands 

81
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,004
and a lot of casual partners,
then first of all there's not much 

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,710
discrimination between one partner and 
the other.

83
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,880
And so in some sense you're in a loop 
and just repeating the same act over and

84
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,350
over,
but you can't,

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,580
there's nothing deep about it.
There's nothing that,

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,590
that enables you to establish a 
relationship with another person.

87
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,424
And I think that that's a,
I think that you corrupt your soul in 

88
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:24,934
that way and that you hurt yourself 
across time and of course you're going 

89
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,864
to hurt other people as well.
So I'm not a big admirer of the casual 

90
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:31,984
sex idea.
I think it's a demented adolescents 

91
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:36,110
fantasy.
Uh,

92
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,160
fundamentally it just doesn't work out 
in the real world.

93
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,100
Now,
healthy self restraint.

94
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,780
Well,
with regards to sexuality,

95
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,270
it's the same with everything else is 
that there's,

96
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,253
there's the necessity to forego 
immediate gratification for the purpose 

97
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,890
of medium to longterm thriving,
let's say.

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,263
So if your sexuality is integrated in an
ethic that encompasses the rest of your 

99
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,640
life,
and if it serves that ethic,

100
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,210
then I would say it's properly 
restrained.

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,553
If it's unhealthily repressed,
well then you're angry and bitter and 

102
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,090
resentful and cursing the opposite sex 
or perhaps the same sex.

103
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:14,924
If you happen to be gay for failing to 
recognize your particular form of 

104
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,830
sexual,
uh,

105
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,803
what would you call attractiveness?
I think resentment and anger are good 

106
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,524
indication that there's something wrong 
with the manner in which your sexuality 

107
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,214
is restraint.
So I hope hopefully that's a decent 

108
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,610
answer,
Trev moocs as why are dragons in western

109
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,444
culture bringers of death and 
destruction that must be slain while in 

110
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:38,630
the east.

111
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,060
They're portant of good fortune to be 
revered.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,260
Well,
I,

113
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,550
that's a great question by the way.
Um,

114
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,070
the,
the Dragon,

115
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,783
the Dragon,
I already defined the dragon at some 

116
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,394
point,
partly from a book I read a while back 

117
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,720
on dragons as a tree cat,
snake bird.

118
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:01,010
The idea in the book was that the Dragon
was a images stick representation of the

119
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,844
class of all predators,
which means also might be why dragons 

120
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,303
also breathe fire because fire was 
undoubtedly a common destructive agent 

121
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,104
in our evolutionary past,
but the dragon is the most primordial 

122
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,240
sim symbol of that which lurks beyond,
which is known.

123
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,183
In fact,
it's even more primordial that that 

124
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,590
because it even is that which lurks 
beyond what is unknown in some sense.

125
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,370
Remember Don Rumsfeld,
unknown,

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,220
unknown unknowns.
Well,

127
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,910
that's basically the drag it.
There are some unknowns that pop up that

128
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,744
you can master right away and you could 
kind of think of those as known 

129
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,594
unknowns,
but unknown unknown's are those things 

130
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,750
that pop up that you don't know about.

131
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,793
You didn't even,
you had no idea whatsoever that they 

132
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,430
even existed anyways.
What's the character of an unknown?

133
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,450
Unknown?
Well,

134
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,150
part of it's terrifying because it can,
it can.

135
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,740
It can do you in,
right,

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,050
but part of it's also positive and 
because it,

137
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,213
anything that's truly unknown brings it 
with a tremendous amount of new 

138
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,814
possibility.
That's why dragons hoard gold or why 

139
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,330
they also heard princesses or guard 
princesses hoard,

140
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,173
I would say is the right word.
So I don't think the dragon in the West 

141
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:15,584
is a fully negative symbol because the 
dragon has gold associated with it or 

142
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,230
virgin.
The reason for that is that the hero who

143
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,470
confronts the Dragon gets the Virgin.
And that hasn't changed.

144
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,800
That's,
that's a story as old as time.

145
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,960
And I don't think it'll ever change as 
long as there are human beings.

146
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,410
Now why the Chinese put stress on the 
positive side and the West put stress on

147
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,250
the negative side is difficult to say.

148
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,140
I might say because the Chinese got 
organized so early,

149
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,453
I have a sneaking suspicion that it was 
easier for them to see a little bit of 

150
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,164
chaos is something positive,
something necessary and positive as a 

151
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:58,830
counterbalance to tremendous 
organizational weight of their state.

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,260
Um,
that's the best,

153
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,810
best answer that I've been able to 
formulate.

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,450
Um,
so,

155
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,753
so anyways,
the dragon is a very complex and 

156
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:10,860
ambivalence symbol.
It,

157
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,280
it combines everything into one symbol,
positive and negative.

158
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,800
And then you can stress the positive or 
you can stress the negative.

159
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,940
You could also say to some degree that 
whether a dragon is positive or negative

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,740
depends to some degree on the manner in 
which you approach it.

161
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:30,741
Because the psychological reality is 
that dragons approached voluntarily,

162
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,770
well,
small are most likely to be positive and

163
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,600
that's a really good thing to know in 
your life.

164
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,800
Uh,
it's a good reason.

165
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,323
It's a good rule of thumb to help you 
stop avoiding things that you shouldn't 

166
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,374
avoid so that they don't grow and 
magnified beyond your capacity to deal 

167
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,604
with them.

168
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,280
You often mentioned disciplining 
children so they behave.

169
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,683
What is your advice for making them 
behave without resorting to corporal 

170
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,800
punishment?
Well,

171
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,634
first of all,
it depends on what you mean by corporal 

172
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,160
punishment.
Um,

173
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,740
timeout could be regarded as corporal 
punishment.

174
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,530
It also depends very much on the age of 
the child.

175
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,930
Um,
at say a two year old,

176
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,300
well,
in my new book,

177
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,134
by the way,
I have a chapter in there called don't 

178
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,470
let your children do anything that makes
you dislike them.

179
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,053
And the reason that I wrote a chapter 
about that is because people who let 

180
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:27,110
their children do things that make them 
dislike them,

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,153
end up disliking them.
And because there's a huge power 

182
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:30,554
differential,
generally speaking between adults and 

183
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:32,834
children,
if you end up disliking your children 

184
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,820
because they're not behaving well,
they're behaving disgracefully say,

185
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,013
or they're,
or they're challenging your position in 

186
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:45,800
the authority hierarchy to regularly 
something you won't put up with.

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,390
By the way,
even if you think you will,

188
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,780
it's necessary to get your disciplinary 
routine straight.

189
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:55,130
So the first thing I would say is figure
out what the rules are.

190
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,630
There shouldn't be too many.
Um,

191
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,573
for two year olds,
basically they have to know what no 

192
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:02,024
means.
And they also have to learn as they 

193
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:10,151
approached three not to kick,
hit bite or steel essentially.

194
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,690
Now it's easy to train a two year old,
but no means you can actually start with

195
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:18,020
a child that's only 13 months old at 
child that can cry,

196
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,213
let's say that or that can crawl.
Let's say that you have a child is 

197
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,350
starting to crawl and wants to explore 
the house.

198
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,184
So the first thing you do,
if you have any sense is try to get rid 

199
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,634
of most things that the child could 
cause a tremendous amount of trouble 

200
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,900
with,
uh,

201
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,793
to,
to the things or to the child so that 

202
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,190
it's reasonably safe.

203
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,533
Um,
and then the child is going to want to 

204
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,620
want to crawl around and get into 
everything.

205
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,454
And so,
but maybe there are things you don't 

206
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,920
want him or her to get into.
Like maybe there's a uh,

207
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,450
oh,
what would we say?

208
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,313
Maybe there's a tablecloth and on top of
the tablecloth there's a plant or maybe 

209
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,354
there's some plants on the floor and 
when the child is crawling and goes off 

210
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,780
to do something that he or she 
shouldn't,

211
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,290
um,
you can just grab his leg and you know,

212
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,124
gently but firmly and say no.
And the child will keep trying to move 

213
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,944
forward because they're stubborn little 
blighters and you can continue to say 

214
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:18,610
no.
And if you persist with saying no,

215
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,570
then the child will eventually give up 
and sort of go limp.

216
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,003
Now,
now and often the child will cry when 

217
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,154
you do that.

218
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,170
And of course that might make you feel 
guilty,

219
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,004
but what that means is that you've 
effectively brought to behavior to a 

220
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,890
halt.
And if you do that 10 times,

221
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,933
you've got to watch your child and don't
stop them from exploring things that 

222
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,494
they need to explore it.
You want to use this sort of thing with 

223
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,560
judiciously.
You can grab them by the leg and say,

224
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,910
no,
no,

225
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,880
no.
And wait until they give up.

226
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,980
Usually they'll cry and then you can let
them go.

227
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,890
And then soon after you do that about 10
times soon.

228
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,650
Then if you just say no with the same 
tone of voice,

229
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,050
the child will generally,
what happens,

230
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,630
the child will immediately cry and then 
stop.

231
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:08,320
And then after about 10 repeats of no 
without having the lake grabbed,

232
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,393
then no,
we'll just produce stopping of the 

233
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
behavior.
And that's unbelievably useful because 

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,273
as soon as your,
you train your child to understand what 

235
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,874
no means,
then they really have free reign of the 

236
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,750
house in some sense with relative 
minimal supervision from you.

237
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,703
First of all,
they can learn what things they're not 

238
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,474
supposed to get into.
And it's amazing how fast children can 

239
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:30,874
learn that and how fast they can 
generalize to the class of things that 

240
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:34,894
they shouldn't get into.
Like you don't have to teach them every 

241
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,620
single thing.
They can generalize very rapidly.

242
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:39,454
That's not much different than thinking,
but also once they are capable of 

243
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:44,584
understanding what no means,
you have an extremely potent means of 

244
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,190
helping them regulate their behavior 
with a minimum of intervention.

245
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,170
So that's unbelievably useful.
So now let's say you have a two year old

246
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:59,080
who's pretty contentious and two year 
olds are pretty contentious.

247
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,140
Some of them in particular because both 
5% of two year olds,

248
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,170
most of them are male,
are quite aggressive by temperament.

249
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,500
And those are the ones that if you put 
with other two year olds will frequently

250
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,840
kick hit,
bite or steel.

251
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,760
Not all kids are like that,
but some are.

252
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,180
Most of them gets socialized out of that
by the time they about four.

253
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,223
Now let's say you have an at two,
they also start to experiment with 

254
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,350
saying no,
uh,

255
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,380
back.
And also with misbehaving,

256
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,150
although they can do that even younger 
than that.

257
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,463
So if you have a two year old who's 
particularly rambunctious and who 

258
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,644
decides he isn't going to listen to you,
we use he in this example because it's 

259
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,580
boys that are more likely to misbehave 
and not or not listen.

260
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,060
You can,
you can pick them up and you know by the

261
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:40,894
arms.
Now you got to get your attitude right 

262
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,533
because you don't want to be stupid.
You don't want to let your kid make you 

263
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,444
mad,
especially when they're really little 

264
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:50,260
because you're really big and you can 
hurt them and so you gotta,

265
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,740
you gotta have a clue.

266
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,200
That's why you want to get the rules of 
discipline in order.

267
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,230
The minimum rules of discipline and why 
you want to have a strategy,

268
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,064
but let's say your two or two year old 
is insisting upon doing something that 

269
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:05,420
you don't want him to do,
like inserting a fork into an electrical

270
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,230
outlet and you just can't have that and 
so you can say no.

271
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,270
Hopefully you've already done the no 
training that I recommended.

272
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,133
And then if that doesn't work,
what I recommend doing is picking the 

273
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:19,310
child up by the arms and then putting 
them on the steps.

274
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,121
Say,
look,

275
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,150
you sit there until you're ready to 
listen.

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,750
Now,
um,

277
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,853
are usually the child will sit there and
then the rule has to be something like 

278
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,050
you can get up as soon as you ready to 
be a civilized human being again and you

279
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:33,884
can refer to yourself,
your own attitude during a process like 

280
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:37,310
that.

281
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,143
Because if the child does comply and 
sits on the steps and then comes and 

282
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,870
says,
I'm ready to be good,

283
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,660
and you like them again and you to be 
honest about this,

284
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,673
then you can tell that he's honest in 
his decision to rejoin the civilized 

285
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:50,594
world.
Now sometimes if you put a two year old 

286
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,920
that's particularly rambunctious on the 
staircase,

287
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,630
that as soon as you let go of their 
arms,

288
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,440
they'll run off and that can be a game 
or it can just be an act of defiance.

289
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,290
And in that case,
then you go get them and he put him back

290
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,470
on the steps and you do that several 
times if necessary.

291
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:07,910
And if that,
that becomes a game,

292
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,060
then you sit on the step and you hold 
him by the arms.

293
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:13,670
Remember no anger cause he's just too,
for God's sake,

294
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:14,504
you know,
you don't have to be angry is put them 

295
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,360
on the steps and hold them and say,
look,

296
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,770
I'm not letting you go until you sit 
there and behave.

297
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,830
And so if you hold them for a while,
he'll squirm and look away and so forth.

298
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,320
But you can get it as a tension if 
you're a little bit stubborn,

299
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,680
you hold him there and say you're going 
to sit there until I decide that you can

300
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,753
leave.
And so you hold them and he'll squirm 

301
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,484
and,
but you can outwait them if your 

302
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,950
patient,
but you gotta make the time.

303
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,650
And then eventually he'll stop squirming
and you can let him go.

304
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,720
And then you can sit there and watch 
him.

305
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,650
And when you think he's,
you know,

306
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,610
decided that he's going to be a 
civilized creature,

307
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,444
then you can say that's good and you can
give them a pat on the head and you can 

308
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,470
say,
let's go back and do what we're doing.

309
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,770
And the rule has to be,
you see that the punishment not only has

310
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:59,660
to bring the behavior to haul in the 
most merciful manner possible,

311
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,220
but it's still effective.

312
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,293
But it also has to satisfy your need for
order and justice so that you don't 

313
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,034
carry resentment and irritation about 
the child's misbehavior forward with 

314
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,314
you.
Because you don't want to kid yourself 

315
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,144
about what sort of Nice person you are.
You're not nearly as nice a person as 

316
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,650
you think.
And no one likes to be,

317
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,903
um,
brought down the authority hierarchy by 

318
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:27,230
a recalcitrant two year old.
So in almost all circumstances,

319
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:30,620
those processes will suffice.
Um,

320
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,023
there's other disciplinary strategies 
that you can use to that are more 

321
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,420
positive.
I mean,

322
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,490
one of the things that you can do,
for example,

323
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,324
if you're,
let's say you want to get your child to 

324
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,130
go to bed,
which is a really good idea,

325
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,500
you should set a stable bedtime for your
child.

326
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:46,334
And I would say if they're under four,
it should be around or seven or 

327
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:50,904
something like that because you want to 
have a life and you want to have a life 

328
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:56,460
with your wife so that you don't end up 
hating your child.

329
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,773
And so one of the things you can do if 
you want to train your child to go to 

330
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,164
bed at eight,
so maybe he's not going to bed until 10 

331
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,180
right now and you want to fix that.
So you say,

332
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,014
okay,
go to the grocery store or a little 

333
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:12,240
convenience store and buy 10 little 
gifts and it can be cheap.

334
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,040
Kids don't care,
they're not very bright,

335
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,874
you know you can fool them.
So by 10 little things that you think 

336
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:21,570
your kid would like and wrap them up and
then put them up on a shelf where he can

337
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,120
see them but can't get out them.
Then you say,

338
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,463
look kid,
I'm going to put you to bed at nine 30 

339
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,624
tonight and uh,
if you don't get out of bed then I'm 

340
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,620
going to give you one of these.
I'm going to give you one of these gifts

341
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,454
in the morning.

342
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,390
So,
or if the,

343
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,303
or you can do it another way too.
If the child is always giving you a 

344
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,160
rough time about getting ready for bed 
and going to bed,

345
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,811
you can say,
look,

346
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:43,644
if you're,
if you put on your pajamas without 

347
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:46,344
fussing and you climb into bed,
then I'll give you one of these little 

348
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,270
gifts.
And so then if that works,

349
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,104
then the child can have a little gift 
and he's in bed at nine 30 and then you 

350
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,524
can make it nine and then you can make 
it eight 30 and then you can make it 

351
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,870
eight and those are called,
that's called success of approximation,

352
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,890
right?
You hit the target,

353
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,753
you specify the target that you want the
child to achieve and then use small 

354
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:10,170
rewards not too often in order to attain
that goal.

355
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,004
And those are unbelievably effective 
strategies and they can actually be 

356
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,334
pretty fun.
But I would say the advice to not let 

357
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,860
your child do anything that makes you 
dislike them is really,

358
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,620
really useful.
Um,

359
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,723
you want to talk this over with your 
partner too so that you have your 

360
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,454
disciplinary strategies and your rules 
talked out so that you don't work at 

361
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,190
cross purposes to one another.
So,

362
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,980
okay,
so that's probably good enough for that.

363
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,820
Can we take the biblical,
Andrew Wells asks,

364
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:39,654
can we take the biblical story seriously
enough with us without also keeping 

365
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,650
biblical traditions?
What's the psychological impact of group

366
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,150
gathering church going?

367
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,140
I think we could take the biblical 
stories seriously enough,

368
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,230
but I don't think that it's particularly
easy.

369
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,693
Um,
the traditions bind the community 

370
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,534
gather.
Now I'm saying that and I don't go to 

371
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,010
church,
you know,

372
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,844
and the reason I don't go to church is 
because while it drives me crazy to 

373
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:09,690
speak,
frankly,

374
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,613
I haven't been able to sit in a 
situation like that ever since I was 

375
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,450
well ever.
Really.

376
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,630
That's really the truth of it ever.
Um,

377
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,190
I'm not convinced that that's a good 
thing because I do believe,

378
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,460
and I've had good conversations about 
this with Jonathan Patio,

379
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,294
I do believe that communal return to the
source of the community's ethics is 

380
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:33,594
actually a necessary thing.
And maybe I'm atoning for my past sins 

381
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,720
by doing these biblical lectures at the 
moment,

382
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,940
which is something that's communal.
So,

383
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,193
and then because there's also something 
about going where a bunch of other 

384
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,290
people are to reaffirm your commitment 
to,

385
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,870
to the good that you're also all aiming 
at,

386
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,670
that's,
that's got some power in it.

387
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,503
And,
and I don't think that that's something 

388
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,410
that we should forgo.
I think it's dangerous.

389
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,244
I mean,
look,

390
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,293
even if you're cynical about church,
and I guess I would put myself in that 

391
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,770
category,
it's,

392
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,570
it's certainly the case that communal 
church going in the 1950s say,

393
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,763
provided the average person with at 
least an hour a week where they were 

394
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:15,664
contemplating,
no matter how poorly the purpose of 

395
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,084
ethics in life and,
and the idea of a higher purpose in a 

396
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,594
higher meaning in life.
And you gotta think that spending an 

397
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,760
hour a week thinking about that is 
better than never doing it at all.

398
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,923
So I don't know how to,
that tradition can be revivified in a 

399
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,300
meaningful way,
but I think it's,

400
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,570
I really do think it's a catastrophe 
that we've lost it because we don't have

401
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,404
a center,
an ethical center that holds our 

402
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:44,584
community together.
And the consequence of that is that 

403
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,740
we're fragmenting quite badly.

404
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,010
So
Edwin Raj Kumar says,

405
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,423
I was wondering what your thoughts are 
on meditation and if you practice it 

406
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,660
yourself.
Well,

407
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,900
that's a good question.
I think I practice it a lot and look,

408
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,190
when I listened to someone,
or even when I listened to myself,

409
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
but let's say when I listened to someone
in my clinical practice,

410
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,193
I think I do it in a meditative way in 
that I sit and listen and I wait for 

411
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:22,840
thoughts to appear rather than 
voluntarily thinking.

412
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,910
So I clear my mind.
I try to keep my agenda's off the table,

413
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,530
my agendas,
whatever they are,

414
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,393
except that I want the best for my 
client in this hour and the best say by 

415
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:35,134
their definition.
And mine jointly decided because that's 

416
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,224
all part of discussion and then I 
listened very carefully and I wait for 

417
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,600
the reactions that occur within me and 
then I share them.

418
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,580
And I think that's a meditative 
exercise.

419
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,590
I think it's different than voluntary 
thinking.

420
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,424
It's like,
you know there's a statement in the new 

421
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:57,901
testament that says a knock and the door
will open asking you will receive.

422
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,530
Now
that's a meditative,

423
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,353
that's a,
that's a call to a meditative mode of 

424
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,420
existence.
It's like,

425
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:11,620
well often what I do for example,
if I want to solve a problem is I,

426
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,993
if I have a problem with my own behavior
or maybe I'm having problems in my 

427
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:19,690
family is all go sit on a bed or a chair
and they'll think,

428
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,840
okay,
I would like an answer to this.

429
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,153
I would like to know what the answer to 
this and I'm willing to accept whatever 

430
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:31,621
answer is appropriate and cause usually 
you get an answer that you don't like.

431
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:32,980
Right?
If it's a real answer,

432
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:33,814
it's not something that you're going to 
be all that happy about and then 

433
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,520
magically so to speak and answer 
appears.

434
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,750
And I think that's a meditative practice
and

435
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,343
the meditative practice is part to clear
your mind of your proximal concerns and 

436
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:51,764
to concentrate more deeply on what might
be regarded as eternally true and to 

437
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:01,991
open yourself up for a revelation in 
relationship to what is eternally true.

438
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,580
And I found that incredibly effective 
and I think that you can live like that.

439
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,133
Um,
you just have to abandon your proximal 

440
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,360
pursuits.
Now in my new book,

441
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,194
again,
I wrote a chapter about that called do 

442
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:17,924
what is meaningful and what not,
what is expedient and it's a bit of a 

443
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:21,824
meditation on the sermon on the mount,
I would say because of the essential 

444
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:25,634
message in the sermon on the Mount,
which is the foundational document of 

445
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:30,250
Western civilization as far as I'm 
concerned,

446
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,103
essentially,
is that you should orient yourself 

447
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,200
ultimately towards the highest good that
you can conceive.

448
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,303
And I've tried to formulate that and I 
mentioned earlier in this q and a that 

449
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,413
the highest good that you can conceive,
it should be something like what would 

450
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:48,344
be good for you now and good for you 
tomorrow and next week and next month 

451
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,664
and next year.
So good for you and all the future use 

452
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:58,130
that might exist.
And also at the same time,

453
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:01,190
good for your family and good for the 
community,

454
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,623
you know,
conceptualize narrowly and broadly and 

455
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,780
good now for your family and the 
community and then also into the future.

456
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,100
So it's something like that.
It's,

457
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,490
it's a balance of goods that stretches 
across time and you,

458
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,830
you have to decide if that's what you 
really want.

459
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:16,664
And my sense would be you haven't gotten
anything better to aim at and that you 

460
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,190
should aim at.
The best thing that you can aim at for a

461
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,190
whole bunch of reasons.

462
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,530
One is if you don't aim at something,
you're certainly not going to attain it.

463
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,364
And if you're going to aim at something,
why not aim for the best thing that you 

464
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:31,544
can think of?
And if you do aim for the best thing 

465
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:36,110
that you can think of and you make any 
progress whatsoever,

466
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:39,950
it's extremely exciting.
And if you do aim for the best thing you

467
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:40,784
can take up and you make some progress,
then it's very life affirming and 

468
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:47,690
validating and that sort of quells your 
anxiety and your existential pain.

469
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,910
And so he get yourself properly oriented
and,

470
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,863
and the sermon on the mount basically 
suggest that you do that by orienting 

471
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,360
yourself towards God.
And for the psychological purposes,

472
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,194
we could conceptualize God as the 
highest good that you can conceive of 

473
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,030
and then you concentrate on the day.
And so you can get up in the morning and

474
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:08,864
you can think,
well,

475
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,570
I want the best possible thing to 
happen.

476
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,680
And so what is it that I should do to 
serve that?

477
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,250
And if you ask that genuinely,
and that's an a meditative way,

478
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,440
I will say you get an answer to that 
right away.

479
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,274
Now the problem is is that it's usually 
an answer that involves some kind of 

480
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:25,634
sacrifice.
It means that instead of doing what you 

481
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,693
would like to do impulsively right now,
you're more likely to have to go do 

482
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,050
something.
You know,

483
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,120
that you've been avoiding.
And that's difficult.

484
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,380
But if you do that,
then you'll have some,

485
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,080
you know,
you can also leave in your day with some

486
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,350
pleasure,
uh,

487
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,720
to reward yourself for doing something 
difficult.

488
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,310
But if you,
if you live that way,

489
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,144
then I think that your,
your house stays clean and your family 

490
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,210
stays organized and the state doesn't 
rock and all that.

491
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:56,520
And all that's extremely,
extremely good.

492
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
So anonymous says,
how do I deal with the fact that I'm a 

493
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:04,410
pedophile and should I tell my family 
and friends it?

494
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,860
Um,
I can't answer the second part of that.

495
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,723
Should I tell my family and friends 
because I don't know your family and 

496
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:14,250
friends and I don't know how you would 
go about telling them.

497
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,323
So I can't make a piece of,
I can't make any advice about that or I 

498
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,460
can't offer you any advice about that.
Um,

499
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,900
I would say that if you have the 
opportunity,

500
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,773
you should probably go speak to a 
counselor or priest or someone that you 

501
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,044
trust
because you're going to have to figure 

502
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,020
out how to deal with that and,
but you should also maybe,

503
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,790
and that's about the best I can do with 
that.

504
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,310
I'm not an expert in the treatment of 
pedophilia.

505
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,430
And so I can't offer you any great 
clinical wisdom,

506
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:46,431
but I would say that you need a plan.
You need to plan and you have to,

507
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,053
and I would include in that plan the 
absolutely catastrophic consequences of 

508
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,510
not regulating that behavior properly.

509
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,950
And you should really think it through 
because that pedophilic impulse,

510
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:02,040
let's say could lead you into seven 
different sorts of hell.

511
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,470
You and whoever you happen to tangle up 
in it.

512
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:09,471
And you might want to avoid severn diff.
You might want to avoid seven different,

513
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,040
seven different forms of hell.
And in order to do that,

514
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:14,874
given the proclivity that you described,
then you're going to have to have a 

515
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:18,570
plan.
Now look,

516
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,750
lots of people have impulses that they 
have a hard time controlling.

517
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:22,584
You know,
alcoholics can't drink alcohol and 

518
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,864
cocaine addicts can't take cocaine and 
most people can't what manifest on 

519
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:30,344
trammeled sexual behavior.
And so it certainly within the capacity 

520
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:36,684
of human beings to regulate impulses 
that aren't in there or other's best 

521
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:40,734
interests.
So I wouldn't regard it as a hopeless 

522
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:42,894
pursuit.
But it does seem to me that it's 

523
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,730
something that you might want to talk to
someone you trust about because it's,

524
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,103
it's a complicated issue and it's a 
proclivity that's likely to lead you in 

525
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,440
a direction that would be,
let's call it sub optimal.

526
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,640
I was wondering what you thought of 
Santa Clause,

527
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,550
if it's a healthy thing for parents to 
practice,

528
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,090
what's the psychological impact of lying
to your child?

529
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,340
Look,
I think the,

530
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,700
I think lying is the wrong way of 
thinking about this.

531
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,990
Santa Claus is a game.
It's a game of pretend and children play

532
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,450
games of pretend all the time,
you know,

533
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,720
so I don't see any harm in it at all.
Now,

534
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,554
you know,
you don't want to prolong that belief 

535
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,270
beyond its natural end point.
But it's a,

536
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,150
it's a massive game and it's a lovely 
game.

537
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:38,070
And I don't believe that there's 
anything harmful in it in the least.

538
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,370
So now what's the psychological impact 
lying to your child?

539
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,830
Let's we can think about that more 
generally.

540
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,470
Don't lie to your children.
Don't lie.

541
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:49,810
Period.
Lying is a really bad idea.

542
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,000
It's a really bad idea.
Um,

543
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,610
it never works.
You might think it works,

544
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:55,444
but that's only because you're blind to 
the consequences and probably willfully 

545
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,160
blind.
Plus it's a terrible weight.

546
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,023
You know,
if you,

547
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,610
if you don't lie,
there's a lot fewer things to keep track

548
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:04,444
of.
Your life is a lot more pristine and 

549
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,970
crystally and,

550
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,723
and then things that you,
that come your way maybe you deserve in 

551
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:17,240
some small measure and it's a bad idea 
to lie now,

552
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:20,330
but I don't think it's a bad idea to 
play pretend games with your children.

553
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,164
I think that's okay.
You once mentioned you were planning on 

554
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:27,620
making an Iq test available alongside 
the big five aspects scale.

555
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:28,640
One,
is that in the works?

556
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,803
Yes.
We have an Iq test that we use for 

557
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,370
business testing.
Um,

558
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,130
although we haven't made it available 
publicly yet.

559
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,180
It is in the works but not for a while 
what we're doing instead.

560
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,010
And that's because it has to be,

561
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,530
well there's a bunch of work we still 
have to do on it to generate the reports

562
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,810
so that they're going to be truly usable
to people.

563
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,773
Now that I would say it's about three or
four months work is necessary to do 

564
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:55,400
that.
Um,

565
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,060
what we are doing right now with the big
five aspects scale though,

566
00:30:59,061 --> 00:30:59,894
so that's that understand myself.com is 
producing a dyad version and so we're 

567
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,340
working on the boyfriend girlfriend 
version right now.

568
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,174
So what that'll mean is that when you go
there and you do your personality test 

569
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,910
and your girlfriend say,
does her personality test,

570
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,043
that you'll both be able to generate a 
dual report that describes the 

571
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:23,720
similarities and differences between you
and your partner and where you're likely

572
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:24,554
to see eye to eye on things and where 
you're likely to defer and what that's 

573
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:27,914
going to mean and what you might want to
do about it if you know what you might 

574
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,400
be able to do about it.

575
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,233
And this we're hoping this will be 
really useful because temperamental 

576
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:36,254
differences are a lot of the reason that
people have a hard time getting along 

577
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:39,854
that and complete inability whatsoever 
to state what they actually want and to 

578
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,250
negotiate,
which has a completely different issue.

579
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,263
I want to build a program to help people
negotiate too at some point in the 

580
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:51,800
future.
That's part of our future plan.

581
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,933
But the next development plan is to,
well there's two of them is to get the 

582
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:56,474
high school version of the self 
authoring program up and running and 

583
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,740
that my program or keeps promising it in
two weeks and I,

584
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,113
these things always take longer than 
expected but I'm sure we'll get it out 

585
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:08,174
in the first quarter of 2018 and then 
also the dyad version of the big five 

586
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:14,260
aspects scale.
Uh,

587
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,240
that should be out in the first quarter 
of 2018 as well.

588
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,020
And then I'm not sure if the Iq test 
will be next on the development track.

589
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,033
See,
one of the things we'd like to do with 

590
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:28,760
understand myself is to expand it out 
into a career,

591
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,360
um,
planning process.

592
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,970
Because look at it this way.
You know,

593
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:38,000
if you have an Iq of a hundred,
which is the average Iq,

594
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,390
so that would place you sort of in the 
middle of the average high school class.

595
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,553
Being a lawyer is probably not a great 
career choice for you unless you're 

596
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:49,370
unbelievably conscientious because 
you're going to be competing with people

597
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:50,204
who have a verbal facility say and a 
problem solving capacity that far 

598
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,554
exceeds yours.
And you're going to have to work like 

599
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:57,914
mad too to just be reasonably competent.
And so what seems to be more logical is 

600
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:09,521
to take a good look at your intellectual
prowess as given cause it's,

601
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:14,900
it's very powerfully biologically 
influenced and to pick a domain of,

602
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,470
of career that you could excel in.

603
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,380
Because why not pick a domain that you 
can excel?

604
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,420
And there's lots of different things 
that you can be.

605
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,420
And so you want to consult your 
temperament.

606
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,254
So if you're agreeable,
then you probably want to work with 

607
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:29,840
people.
And if you're disagreeable,

608
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,150
you probably want to work with things.
And if you're extroverted,

609
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:35,300
you want to have a job that involves 
sales and social activity.

610
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,130
And if you're introverted,
you want to work alone.

611
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:37,964
And if you're open,
you need to do something creative and 

612
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:40,094
entrepreneurial and so on.
So we have to consult your temperament 

613
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,410
to see where you would be properly 
slotted.

614
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,453
And then you have to consider your 
intelligence so that you can find a 

615
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:53,300
niche where you're most likely to excel 
and those niches exists.

616
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:54,430
So,
um,

617
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,393
we'd like to combine the Iq test with 
the big five aspects scale so that we 

618
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,500
can give people reasonable career 
advice.

619
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,333
It's been a longterm goal.
And so those are all on the table and I 

620
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:05,594
have good program team working on them,
but they're very complicated things and 

621
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:11,270
they take a lot of time and we don't 
want to make a mistake and all of that.

622
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:12,104
So,
but maybe the couple's version and the 

623
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:17,750
high school version of the couple's 
version of the personality test and high

624
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,584
school version of the self authoring in 
this quarter and maybe maybe the career 

625
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,650
counseling version of the big five 
aspects scale in the next year.

626
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:28,900
That would be lovely.
Um,

627
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,700
that's probably overly optimistic for 
the second part,

628
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:35,480
but
you often give advice to young adults to

629
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,580
help them avoid some of the pitfalls of 
life.

630
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,880
Any advice for those of us who are 40 
plus who have already faltered?

631
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,820
Look first,
Graham,

632
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:44,654
this is Graham.
Everybody who is 40 pluses has already 

633
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,014
faulted.
But,

634
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,153
but I'm presuming that you mean faltered
in a manner that appears to you to be 

635
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,980
above out above the average,
right?

636
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,480
Well,
what I would really recommend is I think

637
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,860
that you should,
if you haven't already,

638
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:01,694
you should go do the future authoring 
program and maybe the past authoring 

639
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:04,574
program too,
because you should figure out exactly 

640
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,053
how you faltered.
Like what exactly did you do wrong by 

641
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:13,910
your own buy your own analysis,
right?

642
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,610
I'm not saying,
well what social rules did you break?

643
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,500
Although that's not a bad initial 
guideline.

644
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,590
It's like,
so in the self authoring suite,

645
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:22,424
there's a past authoring module and it 
asks you to break your life I to 70 

646
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,113
parks and then to consider the 
emotionally significant or practically 

647
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,900
significant events within each epoch and
detail out there,

648
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:35,150
emotional nature and their consequences.
And so on.

649
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,470
And one of the things you might want to 
figure out is,

650
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,480
well,
when you say that you faltered,

651
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,180
like what do you mean exactly?
And I mean,

652
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,870
exactly go over your life with a fine 
tooth comb.

653
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,300
This is what Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did 
by the way,

654
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,970
in the ghoulag before he wrote the Gulag
archipelago,

655
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:52,500
he went over his life and said,
okay,

656
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:56,100
well like where did I go wrong?
What did I squander?

657
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,500
What mistakes did I make and what did I 
do right?

658
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,950
So that you can orient yourself now and 
then you want to think,

659
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,350
and this is why we built the future 
authoring program.

660
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,660
Well look,
you got 40 years left,

661
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,480
man.
So what do you want them to be like?

662
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,060
So what do you want to aim at?
You know,

663
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,110
at least how are you going to minimize 
the misery if,

664
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:16,500
if,
if nothing else.

665
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,753
And so you need a plan.
And then what you need to do is to 

666
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:20,904
figure out how to work day to day so 
that you incrementally approach that 

667
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:26,334
plan.
So I have another chapter in this new 

668
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:28,870
book,
um,

669
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,053
called compare yourself to who you were 
yesterday rather than to who someone 

670
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:33,894
else's today.

671
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,853
That's really a useful psychological 
stance for someone who's 30 and over in 

672
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:40,644
particular took 20 year olds can still 
kinda compare themselves to other 20 

673
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,380
year olds because all 20 year olds in 
some way are the same,

674
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,543
but 40 year olds are really different 
from each other and sore 30 year olds 

675
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:52,140
for that matter.
So you might think,

676
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:52,974
okay,
well

677
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,143
here's a,
here's a meditative strategy for for 

678
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,003
ceasing to falter.
You could wake up in the morning or you 

679
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,390
could do this at night before you go to 
bed and you could think,

680
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,224
okay,
look,

681
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,410
I want to structure my day to moral so 
that when I,

682
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,220
when I'm done with the day,
my life is in slightly better order than

683
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:19,011
it was when I woke up this morning.
Just slightly better because incremental

684
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:20,424
progress is massively,
massively effective because it bears a 

685
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,660
exponential fruit.
I just like a bank account,

686
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,730
um,
compounds,

687
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,490
incremental progress compounds with 
time.

688
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,470
So you can get up in the morning and you
could think,

689
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:35,304
okay,
there's some things in my life that I 

690
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,300
could put in order today.
They're usually things you don't want to

691
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,470
do.
As I mentioned earlier,

692
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,710
what could I do today that would help 
put my life in order that I would do?

693
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,410
You have to ask yourself.
You can't tell yourself.

694
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:51,690
You have to ask yourself what would you 
do?

695
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,460
And then maybe you have to say,
well,

696
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,790
or maybe you have to say,
under what conditions would I be willing

697
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,820
to do something to put my life in 
further ordered today?

698
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,040
What little reward would I need to give 
myself?

699
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:06,180
And these have to be questions you can 
like take out the whip and boss yourself

700
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,390
around because you'll find that you're a
terrible master and a worst slave.

701
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,740
And so you can get along ways if you 
look low enough.

702
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,350
One of the things Carl Jung said,
which I really liked,

703
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:19,470
was that modern people don't see God 
because they don't look low enough.

704
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,304
They don't have the humility.
Now you said that you have already 

705
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:23,484
faulted.
So it sounds like you've got the 

706
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,314
humility already intact.
So I would say think about what you 

707
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:29,754
want.
Think about what you know around you 

708
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:32,814
isn't set right cause you'll know,
make a list of things that are around 

709
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:37,774
you that aren't right.
And then start thinking about small 

710
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,404
things you can do,
like trivial things that even a fool 

711
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,404
like yourself could manage that would 
orient you in the right direction and 

712
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,933
help straighten out your life and try 
that for a year before you decide that 

713
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:52,870
you're a failure.
You know?

714
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,290
Because you'll find that if you put that
into practice for a year,

715
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,440
that things will be a lot better.
And like I said,

716
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:02,110
you got 40 years left so you're not,
you're not done yet.

717
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,460
And so,

718
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,063
okay.

719
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
The other thing I would say too is,

720
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,863
yeah,

721
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,660
it isn't exactly that.
I would say forgive yourself because you

722
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:12,800
know,
that's just a cliche.

723
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:15,290
But I would say that once you've 
decided,

724
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:19,700
once you what you've done wrong and 
you've put into practice some,

725
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,630
some strategies to rectify that,
that don't,

726
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:27,830
you don't have to beat yourself any more
than is necessary for you to learn.

727
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,910
Which is a good rule of thumb with 
regards to treating yourself and also to

728
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,130
treating other people.
So

729
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,960
I don't think my wife loves are 
internationally adopted daughter and she

730
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:42,794
won't go to counseling with me.
My house is filled with tyranny and 

731
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,450
anger.
Any advice?

732
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,300
Anonymous.
Wow.

733
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,213
Okay.

734
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,690
That's a loaded,
that's a set of loaded questions,

735
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:08,524
man.
I don't think my wife loves are 

736
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:13,540
internationally adopted daughter.
Well,

737
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:18,541
the first question would be why not?
But she in on the adoption,

738
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,560
for example,
was it partly her decision?

739
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,580
Here's a possibility.

740
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,530
Maybe you could ask your under what 
conditions,

741
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,053
ask her more specifically why she 
doesn't like you're internationally 

742
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,960
adopted daughter.
It's too vague.

743
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,110
I don't think my wife loves are 
internationally adopted daughter.

744
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:44,944
Break it down.
Maybe it's something like there are 15 

745
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:52,330
things about our life with our 
internationally adopted daughter that my

746
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,890
wife does not appreciate.
Now,

747
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:56,740
maybe some of those things are the way 
that the daughter behaves.

748
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:59,740
I don't know how old she is or anything 
else about her and

749
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,300
differentiate your problem.
It's too vague.

750
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:07,630
You'll never solve it this way because 
loves isn't the right word.

751
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,913
See if you can write down 30 reasons why
your wife is annoyed about your current 

752
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:13,560
situation.
Um,

753
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,080
and maybe you'll have to differentiate 
each of those 30 into 10 more,

754
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,850
right?
Maybe there's 300 reasons.

755
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,923
And then see if you can start asking her
about fixing some of the reasons that 

756
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,340
you differentiate it.
Because obviously you can't go up to her

757
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:30,880
and say you have to start loving are 
internationally adopted daughter.

758
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,950
That's just not going to work.
And you already know that.

759
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,543
Um,
but if you break that down into the 20 

760
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,560
reasons why she doesn't like your 
daughter,

761
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,663
then maybe you can figure out a way that
some progress might be made on one of 

762
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:45,644
those problems.
And maybe if you take that approach for 

763
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:51,740
a whole year,
then she'll go from like,

764
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,460
she'll at least hit neutral or something
like that.

765
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,853
Um,

766
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,193
that's the best I can do.
Given that I only have three sentences 

767
00:42:02,741 --> 00:42:03,574
to go on.
So differentiate the problem and then 

768
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,814
solve the smaller problems.
You have talked about the difference 

769
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:15,370
between intelligence and wisdom.
Jason Clark,

770
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,580
you have talked about the difference 
between intelligence and wisdom.

771
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,570
Saying,
EH,

772
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,840
intelligence isn't a shortcut to wisdom.
Well,

773
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,970
let's,
let's point something else out,

774
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:25,804
man.
Stupidity isn't a shortcut to wisdom 

775
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:30,340
either.
What is your definition of wisdom?

776
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,693
Okay,

777
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,500
well,
there's the Old Testament view.

778
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:49,020
That's the fear of God is the beginning 
of wisdom.

779
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,333
That's a good one.
I think wisdom is in part the 

780
00:42:58,641 --> 00:42:59,474
willingness to come to terms the 
knowledge of your own capacity for 

781
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:04,460
malevolence.
That's wisdom.

782
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,593
The the desire to rectify that,
the wish to set the world on a pathway 

783
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:15,500
that leads it closer to have and farther
away from hell.

784
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:16,334
That's wisdom.
The humility to know that there's more 

785
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:32,551
things that you don't know then that you
know and that you should be open to what

786
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:33,394
you don't know when people inform you of
it because it's better to learn that it 

787
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:41,821
is to walk nose first into a wall or 
blind folded off a cliff.

788
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,803
The knowledge that you don't have the 
right to be a judge of being without 

789
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,980
having given it your utmost.
That's wisdom,

790
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,790
wisdom.
What else?

791
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,903
The knowledge.
Wisdom is also the knowledge that hell 

792
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:20,424
is real enough so that you should do 
everything you can to avoid either 

793
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,770
inhabiting it or producing it.
That's what I learned from,

794
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:27,604
uh,
from psychological analysis of the 

795
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:33,780
history of the 20th.
Hell's real enough and,

796
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,350
and you,
you're,

797
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,780
you're duty bound.
Let's say your honor bound,

798
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,614
you're ethically bound to do the 
opposite of whatever produces those 

799
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,790
hellish circumstances.

800
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,453
Amy Pellegrini says,
why is self sabotage such a future 

801
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,900
feature in human life?
You know what?

802
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,390
I have a chapter about that in my new 
book too.

803
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,390
Um,
which chapter is it now?

804
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,453
I think it's it.
I can't always match the content with 

805
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,200
the chapter title.
Oddly enough.

806
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,450
I think it's the chapter about picking 
friends that are good for you.

807
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,861
See?
Oh yes,

808
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:21,170
I have it right here.
And I didn't set that up by the way it,

809
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,400
I genuinely did remember,
make friends with the people

810
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,890
who wants the best for you.
Was that it?

811
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,724
No.
Treat yourself like someone you were 

812
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:31,880
responsible for helping.
There we go.

813
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,313
MMM.

814
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,380
Why are self sabotage such a feature?
Okay,

815
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:39,960
here's a couple of reasons.
The first is,

816
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:44,080
is that there's a lot of responsibility 
with success,

817
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,720
right?
So if you,

818
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,230
if you say yes to things and you do a 
good job and,

819
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,900
and you bear a large burden,
then you have to carry it.

820
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,690
And a lot of that might be success.
But you know,

821
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,470
failure is a lot easier than success.
Plus you can complain about it and whine

822
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:01,304
about it and be a victim and you know,
garner all sorts of Kudos from yourself 

823
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:07,370
and others that way.
So there's that.

824
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,310
It's just failure to adopt 
responsibility.

825
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,620
But then I would say too,
there's also revenge on,

826
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,723
on the self and God,
that's partly why I liked the Cain and 

827
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:16,544
Abel story so much.
Once I sort of figured out what it 

828
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:18,890
meant.
Um,

829
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,710
people have a hard time not having,

830
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,120
yeah,

831
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,660
the kind of contempt that borders on 
self hatred for the cells.

832
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:31,494
Partly because you know,
we are fragile and mortal creatures and 

833
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:36,234
prone to error and malevolence.
And we know that of ourselves better 

834
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:39,880
than anyone else.

835
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:41,830
Okay?

836
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,663
Because we know that we're prone to 
punish ourselves and to think ill of 

837
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:47,320
ourselves.
And you know,

838
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:48,154
one of the things I learned from young 
was that the injunction to do unto your 

839
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:56,380
neighbor as you would have him do unto 
you was an equation rather than,

840
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,403
um,
a statement about how to be nice to 

841
00:46:59,051 --> 00:46:59,884
people and that you have an ethical 
obligation to treat yourself as if 

842
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:06,730
you're some a person of value.
Even if you don't really feel that,

843
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:11,731
that you owe yourself the,
that you owe yourself the same treatment

844
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:14,920
that you would give someone that you 
cared for in love.

845
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,290
Now it's a really hard thing to learn,
you know,

846
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:20,620
cause you kind of have to detach 
yourself from your knowledge of all your

847
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,390
insufficiencies and your flaws and treat
yourself with dignity and respect.

848
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,433
At least the dignity and respect.
Do someone who's faulty that could 

849
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:30,994
conceivably learn.
And that's a very difficult ethical 

850
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,630
lesson to learn.
It's,

851
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:37,240
it's easier to beat yourself continually
on the hip,

852
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,074
back of the head with a club and to feel
it's justified given how much you know 

853
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,220
about how wretched and useless you are.
So,

854
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,800
so let's say there's two reasons,
um,

855
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,490
one is that you don't want the 
responsibility,

856
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:53,324
so it's not really self sabotage,
it's just avoidance of responsibility 

857
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:58,420
and consequence failure.
And the second is [inaudible].

858
00:47:59,250 --> 00:47:59,810
Yeah,

859
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,490
punishment,
self punishment.

860
00:48:01,491 --> 00:48:05,090
That seems only just given what you know
about all your pathology and,

861
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,260
and an error and,
and insufficiencies.

862
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,140
So I would say that that's the big two 
there.

863
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,090
Any advice for a grieving parent who 
lost a child unexpectedly?

864
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:21,740
Yeah.

865
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,573
Well one,
I wouldn't say make sure that you turn 

866
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,000
to the people that you have left at you 
love.

867
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,800
The second I would say is don't be 
guilty about grieving.

868
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,443
You know,
and if you have friends you could tell 

869
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:38,330
them,
you could let them do something nice for

870
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:39,164
you because they would like that.
You could figure out something they 

871
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:42,344
could do that would be nice that you 
would appreciate and let them do it 

872
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,793
because you know other people are going 
to grieve at some point in the future 

873
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:50,930
too.
And maybe they'll be able to ask you for

874
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,600
help if you do that.
And then,

875
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,393
well I would,
the next thing I would say is give 

876
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:01,460
yourself time.
You know,

877
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,473
it takes a year,
maybe longer to adapt to adjust even 

878
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:07,423
reasonably to such a catastrophic loss.
And then I would say try not to allow 

879
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:29,050
that terrible wound to make you bitter 
because then not only will you have lost

880
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:31,214
your child and grieve,
but you'll be bitter and then you'll be 

881
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:37,160
resentful and then you'll be hateful.
And that'll be like a terrible,

882
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,620
that'll add insult to injury.
So that's too bad.

883
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,213
Are there ever situations where you 
should hold your tongue and not speak 

884
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,120
what you believe?
Yeah.

885
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,050
You most of the time?
Look,

886
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,310
it's really a tricky thing to figure out
when to say what you have to say.

887
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:01,560
But I can give you a couple of rules of 
thumb.

888
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,190
It's a general question name and I can't
list all the situations,

889
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:07,140
but I can give you some strategic 
advice.

890
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,320
So for example,
if someone is,

891
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,480
um,
has said rude things to you,

892
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,990
for example,
says a rude thing to you,

893
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,013
maybe you shouldn't respond immediately 
even though you're very irritated 

894
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:25,830
because maybe that's just an impulsive 
response and one that you'll regret when

895
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:26,664
you make an anger that you'll,
and so I would say when you're dealing 

896
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:31,580
with someone and you want to chastise 
them,

897
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,820
then you should wait for them to cin 
three times,

898
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:36,920
right?
So the first time they're rude to you,

899
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,000
you think,
oh,

900
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,780
well they're probably having a bad day,
or I misunderstood,

901
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:44,120
or I'm,
I'm rude sometimes too.

902
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,680
And you know,
I'll just let it go.

903
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:48,200
But you don't forget and you don't 
pretend it didn't happen.

904
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:52,720
And then it happens again and you think,
well,

905
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:55,000
that could still be fluke.
That could still be,

906
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,770
that could still be situational.
So maybe I'll just hold my damn tongue,

907
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,950
but I'll remember that.
I'll remember.

908
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:05,560
And then the third time they do it,
then you think,

909
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,190
no,
no,

910
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,660
three times.
That's a pattern.

911
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,490
And so then you can go to them and you 
can say,

912
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:12,190
look,
this happened.

913
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,690
And then maybe they did die.
And you say,

914
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:15,250
well yeah,
you can deny it,

915
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:17,180
but then this happened and maybe they 
denied.

916
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:17,771
And you can say,
wow,

917
00:51:17,771 --> 00:51:20,230
you can deny that.
But then this happened

918
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,780
and you know,
three times the charm.

919
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,940
And that's a time when you should stand 
up for yourself and say what you have to

920
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:30,810
say.
Look,

921
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,470
you have to put yourself in a position 
where you can say what you have to say.

922
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,050
You have to think it through.
You have to have a plan.

923
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,343
And you can't just launch yourself off 
the edge of a cliff and hope that God's 

924
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:43,790
going to catch you on the way down.
And I'm saying,

925
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,663
you know,
it's definitely the case that if you 

926
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,790
have something to say,
like if you're being oppressed at work,

927
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,500
if you've got some,
you know,

928
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,560
horrible tyrant as a boss,
or,

929
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,120
or maybe that's happening to you in your
marriage,

930
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:56,400
or maybe you're the horrible tyrant,
God only knows.

931
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,460
There's things that have to be said,
but that doesn't mean you can just blurt

932
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:01,650
them out.
You have to have a plan.

933
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,420
You have to figure out what you want to 
say.

934
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,510
You have to make it as minimally 
troublesome as possible.

935
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:09,600
You have to have the goal that you want 
in mind,

936
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,090
and you have to have a backup plan like 
this,

937
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,250
the sort of thing that you're talking 
about.

938
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:15,084
You know,
where you need to say something that's 

939
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:19,200
like a little war.
You don't want to walk into that unarmed

940
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:20,034
and unprepared.
And now that doesn't mean that you 

941
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,464
should,
that means that you should set up your 

942
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:25,044
life so that you're firmly enough 
anchored in a variety of different ways 

943
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:33,771
so that you can say what you need to say
without dying as a consequence.

944
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,080
So
you,

945
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,770
Josh Gates.
Oh good.

946
00:52:46,771 --> 00:52:47,604
Josh asked me an easy question.
Young suggested that the Christian Myth 

947
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,003
failed to articulate Christ descended 
into hell and that this resulted in the 

948
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,850
mass shadow projection of the West.
Thoughts?

949
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,960
Yeah.
Well,

950
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,560
I'm going to refer to my book again.
I talk about this and rule seven,

951
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:13,020
pursue what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.

952
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,213
In that Chapter I discussed there's this
idea in Christianity that Christ took 

953
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:19,764
the sins of the world onto himself and I
think that's very much related to the 

954
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:24,660
idea of descent into hell.

955
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,070
They're not exactly the same thing,
but I,

956
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,240
but I'm going to address the first one 
and it will shed light on the second.

957
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:35,730
Okay,

958
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,563
so what does it mean that the Messiah is
archetype lead the figure who takes the 

959
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:41,004
sins of the world onto himself?
What it means practically speaking or 

960
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,824
psychologically speaking.
And I've tried this with some of my 

961
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:49,614
clients who were very naive.
It means to read the history of the 

962
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:57,690
world as if you were the perpetrator of 
the evils that you read about instead of

963
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,630
the victim or the noble intervener.
You know,

964
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,930
I talked to somebody the other day about
the movie Schindler's list,

965
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:04,764
and Schindler was this German 
industrialist who saved a very large 

966
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:10,260
number of Jews that were in danger of 
well in danger of,

967
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,153
of,
of,

968
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,760
of the final solution.
And one of the things he said was,

969
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:15,241
well,
you know,

970
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:16,074
when people watch Schindler's list,
they always think they'd be schindler 

971
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,610
and on if they don't think they'd be 
schindler,

972
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:23,280
maybe they think they'd be the Jewish 
victim of the Nazis,

973
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:26,370
but they almost never think that they'd 
be the Nazi persecutor.

974
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,180
And that's a big mistake because when 
you read about history,

975
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,470
then you're reading about you,
even if the you is the perpetrator.

976
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:37,883
And unless you understand that,
then someone else has to be the 

977
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:40,854
perpetrator.
And if someone else had is the 

978
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,404
perpetrator,
well then you have a devil that you can 

979
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:46,230
chase.
And you know,

980
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:48,840
maybe you've identified the devil 
properly because you know,

981
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:53,160
now and then it's like John Wayne gacy 
or Ted Bundy or someone like that.

982
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:54,120
And you've actually,
you know,

983
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,910
you've identified a perpetrator,
but so often,

984
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,860
far too often,

985
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:01,540
yeah.

986
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,373
The best way to constrain the 
malevolence outside is to constrain the 

987
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:05,494
malevolence within.
And so if you don't have a locale for 

988
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,034
the evil of the world and you have to 
externalize it because the evil of the 

989
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:16,270
world certainly exists now,
it's a better solution to

990
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,420
okay,

991
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,253
assume that you're
fully capable of the terrible things 

992
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:27,310
that people have been capable of throat,
the history of humanity,

993
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:31,720
and to contend with that genuinely.
And there's massive advantages to that.

994
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:32,441
I mean,
first of all,

995
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:33,274
it can actually produce and remarkable 
increment and self esteem because you 

996
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:38,614
know,

997
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,870
if you're just a rabbit and you freeze 
whenever a wolf looks at you,

998
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:45,180
then you're just a frozen rabbit and 
that's not so good.

999
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:46,014
You're just a scared rabbit.
But maybe you learn one day that you're 

1000
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:48,954
not a rabbit that you like,
you're actually quite the damn monster 

1001
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:51,924
and you've got teeth and you could 
really use them in an underhanded and 

1002
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:56,540
horrible way.
This is why people like anti hero movies

1003
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:59,640
so much hay because they go and see the 
villains,

1004
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:00,474
the mafia guys in these tough guys and 
they antiheroes that populate our 

1005
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,250
imagination and think,
oh yeah,

1006
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,620
well I'd really read it like to be 
someone like that.

1007
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:10,590
And the thing is,
is that being useless and weak,

1008
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,530
it's better to be a monster then to be 
useless and weak.

1009
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:14,364
And that's because being useless and 
week makes you a worst monster then a 

1010
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,250
monster.

1011
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,920
That's why it's not like being a monster
is good,

1012
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:20,754
but week use,
this monster is the worst kind of 

1013
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:24,290
monster because that's the sort of 
monster,

1014
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,150
little jumpy in the dark and sink its 
teeth into the back of your neck instead

1015
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,340
of confronting you forthrightly in the 
alley.

1016
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,563
And so if you start to see yourself as 
the perpetrator of historical 

1017
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,410
malevolence,
you know,

1018
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:37,960
if you can imagine yourself as an 
Auschwitz camp guard,

1019
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,560
if you see yourself as,
as the,

1020
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:41,883
the vicious villain of the human story,
then all of a sudden you've got a lot 

1021
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,304
more respect for yourself and you can 
unlock that internal monster and that 

1022
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:48,874
internal monster.
And then maybe you can tame the damn 

1023
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:51,454
thing or at least bring it,
bring it into some sort of partnership 

1024
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:56,020
with yourself.
And then when someone pushes you around,

1025
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,003
you can let a little bit of that out in 
your eyes just a little bit and you can 

1026
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:00,784
say,
ah,

1027
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,020
it would be better for you.

1028
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,060
And for me if you didn't continue to do 
that.

1029
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,953
And you can actually mean it.
And then actually it will start because 

1030
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,600
if you let a little bit of that out when
you tell someone to stop,

1031
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:13,090
the probability that they'll stop is 
extremely high.

1032
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,283
And then just a tiny like vision of the 
monster you could become is enough to 

1033
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,200
keep order in your house.
Hey,

1034
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:25,030
and maybe in your state.
And so the mass shadow projection of the

1035
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:25,721
West,
well,

1036
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:28,030
you know,
here's another thing.

1037
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,880
So one of the things the Christians 
figured out was that,

1038
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,020
um,
the snake in the garden of Eden was also

1039
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,370
Satan.
Ah,

1040
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,710
I can't get into that.
It's too complicated.

1041
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:43,120
You'll have to read chapter seven if you
want a full explication of that idea.

1042
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,640
I that's as good an answer as to the 
question does.

1043
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:48,340
I can manage tonight.
I spent all day,

1044
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:49,743
let's see,
all day I got up at seven and I worked 

1045
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,220
all day till five on this video I told 
you about.

1046
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,650
So I made about 400 and it's or 
something like that.

1047
00:57:56,651 --> 00:57:59,110
So I'm a little bit on the burnt outside
tonight.

1048
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,910
So
let's see.

1049
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:04,744
Let's take a couple of questions from 
the live chat and it's zooming along 

1050
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,314
here.
So,

1051
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,873
um,

1052
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,880
how should one deal with recurring self 
pity and why is it so gripping?

1053
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,733
Well,
it can be gripping for a variety of 

1054
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:22,480
reasons.
It can be gripping because you are,

1055
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,680
let's see,
because you are high in neuroticism.

1056
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,880
That's a possibility.
And A,

1057
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,700
and why is it so gripping?
Well,

1058
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:35,520
that's another potential reason.
It's hard for me to say.

1059
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,470
Um,
let's see.

1060
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,500
I have a,
another chapter like that.

1061
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,130
What's it called there?
Um,

1062
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,451
yeah,
again,

1063
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:50,540
it's rule to treat yourself like someone
you were responsible for helping.

1064
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,430
Well,
why the hell wouldn't you pity yourself?

1065
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:53,330
I mean,
people are,

1066
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,760
life is tragic.
Everything ends in death.

1067
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:58,040
Everything that you have will be taken 
away from you.

1068
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,600
You're weak and breakable and prone to 
fits of impulsivity and malevolence.

1069
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,820
How could you not have self pity?
Well,

1070
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,080
that's really the answer,
but,

1071
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,640
but the next answer is,
yeah,

1072
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:09,320
well,
despite that it's not good enough.

1073
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,390
You have to rise above all that even 
though you have every reason for it.

1074
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,260
That's the thing that's so paradoxical 
is you have to rise above it even though

1075
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:18,094
you have every reason for it.
And part of the reason you have to rise 

1076
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:22,880
above it is because if you don't,
it makes everything worse.

1077
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,910
You and everything else and being 
itself.

1078
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,770
And so it's gripping because well,
it does grip you,

1079
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,693
you know,
malevolence and tragedy and 

1080
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,660
vulnerability and mortality.

1081
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,700
They're gripping.
And I would say,

1082
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:38,534
well,
you have to find something that's even 

1083
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,780
more gripping than that.
And I would say the most,

1084
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,110
the thing that's most gripping,
the only thing that's more gripping than

1085
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:48,410
that in true and truth is to live a good
life,

1086
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,053
to live the best life you possibly can 
to live a life that's so noble that all 

1087
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:57,740
of those things are justifiable.
Uri l three 33 he says,

1088
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,770
jp thinks he is a monster.
L U.

1089
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,603
L I didn't know what l u l means,
but I don't actually think I'm a 

1090
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,294
monster.
There's a difference between thinking 

1091
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:08,660
you're a monster and knowing you're a 
monster.

1092
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,750
All right?
Foglight says,

1093
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:14,370
I love this guy.
Well thank you.

1094
01:00:14,371 --> 01:00:17,100
Foglight I would probably love you too 
if I knew you.

1095
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:23,210
Let's see
who's that?

1096
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,730
Santa's Christ says I'm a monster.
Roar.

1097
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,080
Good.
Well that's a good start,

1098
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:33,700
man.
That's a good start.

1099
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:36,070
Practice that roar.
Um,

1100
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,950
and get good at it because there'll be 
times when you need it.

1101
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,503
So,

1102
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:45,280
okay,

1103
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,460
Dj chronic says,
I let myself be that week monster for so

1104
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:48,971
long.
Yeah,

1105
01:00:48,971 --> 01:00:49,804
well maybe you know what it's like man 
down in your basement fantasizing about 

1106
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:54,820
revenge.
That's no bloody fun.

1107
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,833
But you know,
this is something now for an adler new 

1108
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:58,654
too.
He's worth reading those fantasies of 

1109
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:01,181
revenge.
You know,

1110
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:03,820
they have the seeds within them.
You knew this as well.

1111
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,780
The seeds within them of the new you.
You can let those,

1112
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,490
you can let those fantasies.
What would you say?

1113
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:10,324
Manifest themselves and see what seeds 
of potential future development or 

1114
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,360
harbored within them.
That's also extremely useful.

1115
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,583
Okay.

1116
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,250
Ethan for Gal says,
how do you boost your confidence?

1117
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:27,084
Talking to people and get rid of the 
paranoid that people hate you and don't 

1118
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,490
like you and think you're trash.
That's how I feel.

1119
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,140
Okay,
well the first thing is,

1120
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:35,603
um,

1121
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,990
let me tell you a little bit about 
courage.

1122
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,120
No,
a little bit about trust.

1123
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:48,060
Sorry.
When you're a naive person,

1124
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,493
you trust people because you think that 
people are good and then maybe someone 

1125
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,960
comes along and hurts you and you think,
oh no,

1126
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,730
people aren't good.
I can't trust anyone.

1127
01:01:56,731 --> 01:02:00,960
And then maybe you're paranoid.
You think that people hate you and don't

1128
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:03,150
like you and think you're trash and so 
forth.

1129
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:05,220
You don't trust people.
Then you figure out,

1130
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,240
Jesus,
this whole knock,

1131
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:09,580
trusting people isn't working out very 
well because now I can't get anywhere.

1132
01:02:09,581 --> 01:02:10,414
And,
and if I ever do meet someone who's 

1133
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:12,623
trustworthy and I don't trust them,
then they're not going to get an 

1134
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:16,350
opportunity to show me that they're 
trustworthy.

1135
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:17,184
And so then what happens is that you 
replace naive trust with courageous 

1136
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,014
trust and you put yourself out there 
despite the fact that people might hate 

1137
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,060
you and don't like you and think you're 
trash.

1138
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,010
You know?
So

1139
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,080
the other thing I would say that's more 
practical,

1140
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,153
Ethan,
I think you'd find that you only think 

1141
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:37,454
that when you run away,
my suspicions are if you went out and 

1142
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:41,174
talked to people,
like you'd have to have something to 

1143
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:44,690
talk about,
you know,

1144
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,700
but if you went out and talked to 
people,

1145
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,163
you'd find that those thoughts only 
bothered you for about 10 to 15 minutes 

1146
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:53,870
and then you would get over them.
You know,

1147
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:58,040
a lot of that's a high neuroticism and,
and that's,

1148
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,460
uh,
that in the big five aspect scale,

1149
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,294
that's withdrawal.
You're experiencing a lot of withdrawal 

1150
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:07,670
related negative emotions,
anticipatory anxiety.

1151
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,550
And the best way to overcome that is to 
not avoid.

1152
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,310
So if you find yourself avoiding social 
situations,

1153
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:16,010
then you have to formulate a plan to 
stop doing that.

1154
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,620
And then over time your confidence will 
be boosted.

1155
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:27,390
Let's see here.
That guy.

1156
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:29,550
Yes.
When I watched those movies,

1157
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:31,740
I always liked the bad guys.
I knew they were evil,

1158
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,360
but they just seem cool.
Yeah.

1159
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:34,194
Well the thing is there's nothing cool 
and there's also nothing good about 

1160
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,540
naive harmlessness.
You know,

1161
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,630
this is one of the things I really liked
about,

1162
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,540
about learning.
What I learned from you.

1163
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,483
It's like,

1164
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,510
okay,

1165
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,280
naive harmlessness is

1166
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,690
okay.

1167
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,130
It's worse than monstrosity because the 
problem is if you're naive and harmless,

1168
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,203
then someone else has to be the monster 
and that's not good because you are the 

1169
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,220
monster.
So,

1170
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,270
so the bad guys are cool because they're
cooler than the people who think they're

1171
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:11,370
good,
but who are just cowardly and naive.

1172
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,713
That's why.
That's why people like bad guys in 

1173
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:15,630
movies.
So

1174
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,013
David Jackson,
what are your thoughts on Sophia's 

1175
01:04:52,461 --> 01:04:54,950
citizenship status?
That's the robot.

1176
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:55,784
I believe that the Saudi,
the Saudi Arabians made into a citizen 

1177
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,860
here.
I've got a thought.

1178
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:04,580
Wouldn't it be nice if the Saudis 
actually let their women be citizens?

1179
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,350
That's what I,
that's my thoughts.

1180
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,513
So I don't think that the rest of the 
world is in any position to take any 

1181
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:11,564
lessons.
On what whatsoever on what constitutes 

1182
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:16,460
citizenship from the Saudis.
That's my feeling about that.

1183
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:20,170
I'm,
I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabian culture.

1184
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,210
I'm not a fan of the way that they treat
their women.

1185
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,193
I'm not a fan of the way that they 
disseminate Wahhabi propaganda into the 

1186
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:28,300
west.
I'm not a fan of the way that they,

1187
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,463
they despise work and,
and I'm not a fan of the Saudi Arabians 

1188
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:33,964
and the fact that they,
granted Sophia citizenship status is a 

1189
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:40,810
publicity stunt of the worst form as far
as I'm concerned.

1190
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,333
So

1191
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,200
hello,
Dr. Peterson.

1192
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:48,290
Do you ever fear that your psychological
reading of the Bible is wrong?

1193
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:52,700
While I'm sure it's wrong in some ways 
even Satan can use scripture for his own

1194
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:53,534
purpose.
What if you're just using the word for 

1195
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:56,600
your own gate?
Well,

1196
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:59,750
then God helped me.
I guess that's,

1197
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:00,584
that's what I would say.
What if I'm just using the word for my 

1198
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:03,914
own gain?
I guess it would depend on what you 

1199
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,360
think of is gain.
I am using it for my own gain,

1200
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,250
but I would say that I've aligned my own
game with the gain of others.

1201
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,520
And that's made my own game.
It's a weird thing,

1202
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:17,354
right?
Because if I'm see that way I can have 

1203
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:23,900
my cake and eat it too.
I can do what I think is best for me,

1204
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:24,734
but at the same time I can do what is 
best for others and I've also defined 

1205
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,480
what is best for me as what is 
simultaneously best for others.

1206
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,550
And I believe that.
I truly believe that.

1207
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,550
I think I'm fully convinced of that 
because I've thought it through.

1208
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,780
So
that's my answer to that.

1209
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,643
Ellen Wilson,
how do I tell my half brother 14 and 17 

1210
01:07:06,471 --> 01:07:08,180
their father didn't leave three years 
ago,

1211
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:10,220
but that we kicked him out because he's 
a pedophile.

1212
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:13,370
Who targeted my sister?
The older one is autistic.

1213
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:16,940
I'm tired of lying.
Jesus.

1214
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:18,140
Ellen,
that's a rough one.

1215
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:31,290
I can't tell you I can't help you.
It's too,

1216
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,330
I'd need to know way more details.
I can imagine you're tired of lying.

1217
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,600
The 14 year old might be a little young.
I Dunno ellen.

1218
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,240
It's too complicated.
I can't,

1219
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,940
I can't come up with a good ex.
Good answer for you.

1220
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm sorry.
I,

1221
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:51,590
I'd have to know more details in order 
not to botch the job.

1222
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,060
Okay.
Let's see here.

1223
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:03,770
I'm a British conservative millennial 
training to be a school teacher.

1224
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:07,310
How can I protect children age five to 
11 from postmodernism,

1225
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:09,500
which is everywhere in school.
God,

1226
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,300
that's a good question.
That's free at Hana.

1227
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,120
That was the main video I was making 
today was about that.

1228
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,350
Teach them what you believe to be true,
right?

1229
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:26,790
Formulate for yourself a philosophy of 
education or a serious one.

1230
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:27,690
Write it down,
right?

1231
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,490
You can think about it as a mission 
statement,

1232
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:31,200
but write it down.
Spend some time on it,

1233
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:32,034
man,
because you're devoting your whole life 

1234
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:33,864
to that.
Figuring out what kind of teacher you 

1235
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:38,700
want to be and come up with articulated 
reasons why you're going to be that sort

1236
01:08:38,701 --> 01:08:41,340
of teacher and then do it come hell or 
high water.

1237
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:42,623
You know,
like often there's kids out there that 

1238
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:45,294
only have to run into one good adult and
that will set them on the proper course 

1239
01:08:48,661 --> 01:08:50,940
to the life.
And you could be that one good adult.

1240
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,630
So I would say learn everything you 
count about paws postmodernism.

1241
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,464
So you're a master of it.
Decide what sort of teacher you want to 

1242
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,970
be,
implement that and and you'll,

1243
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,060
you'll be a bulwark against that kind of
catastrophic foolishness and,

1244
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,220
and help many,
many people.

1245
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,770
If the right to identify with certain 
arguments has to be earned.

1246
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:18,340
How does one earn it?
How do we truthfully discuss ideas

1247
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,500
for which we have not earned it?
That's been wood.

1248
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:46,400
If the right to identify with certain 
arguments has to be earned,

1249
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:49,220
how does one earn it?
Well,

1250
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:50,054
I think you start by feeling out 
physiologically what arguments you do 

1251
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:57,854
have the right to make and when,
and that's that meditative consultation 

1252
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:05,570
practice that we talked about earlier.
You have to

1253
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:08,423
pay attention to your words and see if 
when you utter them they put you in a 

1254
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:12,774
solid place.
That's the line between chaos and order 

1255
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:15,654
as far as I'm concerned.
And you can test continually that the 

1256
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:23,730
extensibility of your arguments by doing
so you can,

1257
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,043
you can implement more and more 
sophisticated arguments as you get 

1258
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:28,853
better and better at finding that place 
to stand and take on larger and larger 

1259
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:34,050
problems.
I guess that's the other part of it is,

1260
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,200
you know,
how do you earn the right to,

1261
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,430
to,
to an argument,

1262
01:10:38,431 --> 01:10:41,130
to a position,
pick a small problem,

1263
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,413
one that you think you could solve,
but that's a little more than you can 

1264
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:45,924
chew.
You know that bite off a little more 

1265
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:50,670
than you can chew but not too much.
And then see if you can be successful at

1266
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:51,504
solving it.
And then that'll strengthen and put 

1267
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:53,730
things in order a little bit.

1268
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:54,563
And then that will entitle you to the 
use of certain arguments and those 

1269
01:10:58,261 --> 01:11:00,540
arguments we related to what you've just
done.

1270
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:03,540
And then as soon as you've done that,
you'll be a little stronger and more put

1271
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:07,380
together and then you can take on a 
little bit bigger problem and fix that.

1272
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:10,260
And then the same thing will happen.
And you just keep doing that.

1273
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:12,570
It's like progressive weightlifting and 
that,

1274
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:13,883
and you,
you can't truthfully discuss ideas that 

1275
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,610
you haven't yet earned.
You can't,

1276
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,673
you have to be quiet,
you have to listen or you have to think 

1277
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:23,910
about something else.
You have to do something else.

1278
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:25,270
There's lots to do.
You know,

1279
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,423
you don't have to engage in arguments 
that you don't have any right to engage 

1280
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:33,060
in when there's all sorts of things you 
can engage in right in front of you that

1281
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:33,894
would fully engage you,
that would be very useful in that you 

1282
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,650
could contribute to,
you know,

1283
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:39,960
I really liked this idea of incremental 
improvement.

1284
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:41,430
It's soul,
it's such a good idea.

1285
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,743
You look around,
like I have this room that I'm in right 

1286
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:45,414
now and it's kind of messy.
I know I tell people to keep their room 

1287
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:52,020
clean and I'd been trying to clean up 
this room since like last January,

1288
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,070
but I guess because so much chaos has 
been generated

1289
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,960
around me in some sense that some of 
it's flooded into this room.

1290
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,640
The rest of the house is in really good 
order,

1291
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,980
but the residual chaos is still in this 
room.

1292
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,600
But when I come in here,
you know,

1293
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,793
I,
I try to spend five minutes to clean up 

1294
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,340
a bit of correspondence or something and
I'm,

1295
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,170
I'm definitely making progress.
The room is in much better shape than it

1296
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:17,450
was.
Um,

1297
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,443
don't underestimate the utility of 
incremental improvement and you 

1298
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:24,044
strengthen yourself by doing that.
And then you can talk about the things 

1299
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:28,040
that you've actually done,
you know,

1300
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:28,874
in detail in the kind of detail that 
would convince someone who is skeptical 

1301
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:34,520
and knowledgeable that you are someone 
who knew what they were talking about.

1302
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,190
And then if you do that over 10 years,
like you'll,

1303
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,570
you'll be solid.
Your,

1304
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,000
the,
the,

1305
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,833
the breadth of argumentation that you'll
have at your fingertips will vastly 

1306
01:12:43,251 --> 01:12:44,084
improve.
I'm a female student in stem and I feel 

1307
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:54,600
bombarded by all the feminist groups 
trying to infantilize me.

1308
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,720
How do I prevent them from turning me 
into an adult child?

1309
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,393
You know,
one of the things that's really useful 

1310
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:05,840
to do in university is to pick your peer
group.

1311
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,880
When I went to university,
like I,

1312
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:11,030
I made new friends in university and 
that was really useful.

1313
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,953
So I had my personal friends and they 
were people who were trying to aim at 

1314
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:16,154
something better than what they had,
something better than what they had 

1315
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:21,770
left.
And that was a real relief to me.

1316
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,980
I wrote about that in my new book too.
Um,

1317
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:28,880
called make friends with people who want
the best for you.

1318
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:30,920
That's rule three.
Um,

1319
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:33,770
but I also realized that when you went 
to university,

1320
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:34,604
you picked your peers and in the stem 
fields is what you should do is pick 

1321
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:41,360
some great scientists and those could be
people that you just read books about.

1322
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:45,410
Pick some great scientists,
man or some great engineers.

1323
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:46,244
There's some great mathematicians,
cause I don't know where you are in the 

1324
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:48,824
stem fields.

1325
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:49,723
Pick some,
pick a hero or two or three and then 

1326
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:53,564
make those of your peers right and don't
pay any attention to all the noise and 

1327
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:59,000
Ruckus that you hear around you.
It's all nonsense anyways.

1328
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,103
Partly what should happen when you go to
university is that you should be 

1329
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:06,320
introduced to great people and those can
be great people of the past.

1330
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:07,154
They,
their spirits still live on in their 

1331
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:09,044
work,
in their books and you can pick them as 

1332
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:14,200
peers and ignore all that idiot 
political nonsense.

1333
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:18,190
Well you straighten yourself out and 
learn to be great at what you do.

1334
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,833
Develop a philosophy of greatness.
And that will keep the social justice 

1335
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,034
warriors at bay.
What books are we read to our young 

1336
01:14:28,851 --> 01:14:30,350
children?
Well,

1337
01:14:30,351 --> 01:14:33,050
it depends on how young,
really young.

1338
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:33,884
There's this book called how to teach 
your child to read in a hundred easy 

1339
01:14:36,381 --> 01:14:37,700
lessons,
all type that.

1340
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:43,690
Um,
no,

1341
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:51,721
I've done something technical.
It's called how to teach.

1342
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:05,410
I mean something technically poor your 
child to read in 100 easy lessons.

1343
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,000
That is an excellent book because you 
can actually teach your child to read it

1344
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:14,750
in a hundred easy lessons.
Very smart,

1345
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,920
very,
very smart book.

1346
01:15:15,921 --> 01:15:18,770
Very well developed psychologically 
older kids.

1347
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:19,723
I really liked the Harry Potter books.
I think that rolling nailed the 

1348
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:24,590
mythological structure.
Um,

1349
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:26,443
what else?
I mean I'm in collaboration with my 

1350
01:15:28,311 --> 01:15:29,144
daughter.
I'm putting together a reading list for 

1351
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:32,780
young people for,
for kids and young adults.

1352
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:35,180
So I guess I'll have to answer it that 
way.

1353
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,613
[inaudible]

1354
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:43,610
I can't bring it to mind and I can't 
bring it to mind.

1355
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,193
Okay.

1356
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,503
Daniel,
how to be a good partner to someone 

1357
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:55,560
suffering from depression?
That's a tough one,

1358
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:56,394
man.
It's very hard to live with someone 

1359
01:15:57,751 --> 01:15:58,584
who's suffering from depression.
We helping without enabling and pushing 

1360
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:04,140
without being too judgmental?
Well,

1361
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,000
again,
the devil's in the details.

1362
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:09,210
Is the person seeing a counselor because
if they're depressed,

1363
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:13,560
then they need to talk to someone.
Have they tried antidepressants?

1364
01:16:13,561 --> 01:16:16,470
Because if they're depressed,
they should try antidepressants

1365
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,730
and they should be strongly encouraged 
to do so.

1366
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:26,780
And maybe that encouragement should even
border on a demand because depression is

1367
01:16:26,781 --> 01:16:27,770
just,
it's terrible.

1368
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,840
It's terrible for the person who's 
experiencing it,

1369
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:32,190
like unalterably terrible.
Um,

1370
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,853
and it's terrible for the person who is 
living with the person who has 

1371
01:16:39,171 --> 01:16:40,004
depression.
And so it's incumbent on the person who 

1372
01:16:41,991 --> 01:16:42,824
has depression to do everything they 
possibly can in order to set it 

1373
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:48,470
straight.
And it's hard.

1374
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:50,960
But you know,
there's lots of potential treatments for

1375
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:53,390
depression that have some efficacy in 
antidepressants.

1376
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,224
Really do work wonders on people.
You could try five hydroxy tryptamine 

1377
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,220
too.
You could look that up.

1378
01:16:58,221 --> 01:16:59,054
Five htp,
it's usually three times a hundred 

1379
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:02,770
milligrams.
Um,

1380
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,460
and you can,
if you try that,

1381
01:17:04,461 --> 01:17:05,294
sometimes you can find out if 
antidepressants will work for you 

1382
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:09,320
without having to resort to the 
antidepressants.

1383
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,353
Um,
you can also help the depressed person 

1384
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,054
make a plan in the morning.
That can be really useful or maybe a 

1385
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:17,324
plan the night before if they're just 
not in any shape to do it in the 

1386
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,570
morning,
to sit down and say,

1387
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:23,060
okay,
well you have to get through tomorrow.

1388
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,380
And that's another good,
that's another good piece of advice.

1389
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:28,214
And so in rule 12,
I talk about that sometimes in 

1390
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:33,254
relationship to depression,
real 12 is pet a cat when you encounter 

1391
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:36,464
one on the street and it's a bit of a 
meditation about what to do when your 

1392
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,640
life is in absolute crisis.
But,

1393
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,063
um,
one of the things you can do with 

1394
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:43,964
someone who's depressed is narrow.
And this is what I discuss in this 

1395
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,160
chapter is narrowed their timeframe.
You know,

1396
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:51,800
maybe a depressed person can't think a 
week ahead,

1397
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,860
but maybe they can think about tomorrow 
and you can sit down and say,

1398
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:56,480
okay,
well you have to get through tomorrow.

1399
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,370
And so how are we going to structure 
tomorrow?

1400
01:17:58,371 --> 01:17:59,204
So that will be okay.
And so that you'll be able to sleep 

1401
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:02,960
reasonably soundly when you go to bed 
tomorrow night.

1402
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:03,794
And then tomorrow night we'll do the 
same thing and helping someone come up 

1403
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:07,634
with a daily plan can be,
now they might object and squawk and 

1404
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:12,290
complain about it,
but you should be.

1405
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:13,383
Um,
I would say relatively persistent about 

1406
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:15,950
that and you can say,
look,

1407
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:18,590
let's just try it for a week.
And if they say no,

1408
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,870
then you say,
well let's try it for one day.

1409
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,160
You know,
Christ,

1410
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,143
the person's got to be pretty 
unreasonable if they let's plan for 10 

1411
01:18:25,761 --> 01:18:28,130
minutes just for tomorrow and see if 
that's helpful.

1412
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,810
You know,
if the person objects,

1413
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:30,644
you can keep cutting the magnitude of 
what you're asking down until you 

1414
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:36,380
finally get a bit of a,
a bit of an agreement from them.

1415
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:38,930
But helping someone depressed plan can 
help a lot

1416
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,553
you up.
You said you don't go to church because 

1417
01:18:57,841 --> 01:18:58,674
the pastors are lying most of the time.
What do you mean by lying in this 

1418
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:02,274
instance?

1419
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:04,663
I don't,
my experience has been that they don't 

1420
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:08,570
believe what they're saying.
That's what it sounds like to me.

1421
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,093
That's what I mean by lying.
They say these things and they tell 

1422
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:12,944
people to believe them.
But they don't believe them themselves 

1423
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:15,703
and so,
and they're actually not listening to 

1424
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:17,804
them.
They're not listening to what they're 

1425
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:19,664
saying.
That's the thing that I've always had 

1426
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:21,344
this experience in church and there's 
lots of other reasons I don't go to 

1427
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:25,070
church and a lot of them have to do with
me,

1428
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:28,910
not with the insufficiency of church,
but you know,

1429
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,193
a lot of the scriptural writing's really
have really hit me and I do understand 

1430
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,640
some of them,
I think to some degree and it's,

1431
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:40,610
it's kind of painful to hear them 
utilized by people who are doing it.

1432
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,560
Formulaically or

1433
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:43,940
okay.

1434
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,773
Without conviction or even worse knowing
full well that they don't believe what 

1435
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:51,920
they're saying.
And so that's what I mean by lying.

1436
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:57,950
My first ever girlfriend of three months
is pregnant and keeping the baby.

1437
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,760
She said I can walk away or marry her.
No in between.

1438
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,360
I don't love her.
What do I do?

1439
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,353
Well,
I guess you have to figure out what you 

1440
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:18,394
want.
Like maybe you could sit down and write 

1441
01:20:21,911 --> 01:20:26,911
out what you would like in terms of your
relationship with this child.

1442
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,353
You know you've got a child coming.
That's really something that's someone 

1443
01:20:30,641 --> 01:20:32,680
that could actually like you,
you know,

1444
01:20:32,681 --> 01:20:37,060
maybe you could write down and you could
sit down and write out and offer,

1445
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,013
here's what I could offer to this child.
Here's what I would like to offer to 

1446
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:43,900
this child.
Think about it because you know,

1447
01:20:43,901 --> 01:20:45,880
maybe you want to have a relationship 
with this person.

1448
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:46,723
You know,
that person might be around when you're 

1449
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:48,334
like 70 so there's somebody you could 
have a relationship with the rest for 

1450
01:20:51,191 --> 01:20:52,024
the rest of your life.
What do you want that person to think 

1451
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:53,861
about?
You know,

1452
01:20:53,861 --> 01:20:56,380
you don't love her mother,
that that's a real complication.

1453
01:20:56,381 --> 01:20:57,670
And you know,
I would say,

1454
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,830
well that's a real complication.

1455
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:03,580
So you're in quite the fix,
but you could decide what you're willing

1456
01:21:03,581 --> 01:21:05,770
to offer and then you could and do it in
detail,

1457
01:21:05,771 --> 01:21:06,640
right?
Not just,

1458
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:07,750
well,
I'd like to help.

1459
01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:08,720
It's like,
Jesus,

1460
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,980
that's not helpful either way past,
I'd like to help,

1461
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,233
you know,
here's the amount of money I'd like to 

1462
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:17,230
contribute.
Here's an amount of time I would like to

1463
01:21:17,231 --> 01:21:18,064
spend with the child.
Here's an amount of time I would spend 

1464
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:22,660
babysitting,
like make differentiated,

1465
01:21:22,661 --> 01:21:23,950
make a real plan.
Like,

1466
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:24,813
like you're someone with a clue and 
offer that to your girlfriend and see 

1467
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:30,010
what she says and give her some time to 
think about it,

1468
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:30,844
you know,
because maybe this could be a blessing 

1469
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:33,544
instead of a curse.
So she said I can walk away or marry 

1470
01:21:37,361 --> 01:21:38,440
her.
No inbetween.

1471
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:40,030
Well,
that's what she says,

1472
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:42,520
but you know,
maybe if you made her a concrete offer,

1473
01:21:42,521 --> 01:21:43,930
she'd be willing to reconsider.

1474
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:49,330
Often like a new mother can really use 
help with the baby could really use help

1475
01:21:49,331 --> 01:21:51,550
with the baby.
So even just being a babysitter,

1476
01:21:51,551 --> 01:21:52,384
if you were like committed to it and 
made the real offer like you'd thought 

1477
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:56,501
about it.
How about,

1478
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:58,960
think about it for a whole week.
It's like,

1479
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,430
okay,
here comes this baby.

1480
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:02,860
If I was being a civilized,
useful person,

1481
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,050
but I don't love the mother,
um,

1482
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,660
then what should I do?
Well,

1483
01:22:07,661 --> 01:22:08,494
you're going to have to ask yourself a 
lot of questions and maybe talk to some 

1484
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:11,650
people that you trust,
but,

1485
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:12,853
um,
it's a problem we're solving because it 

1486
01:22:14,231 --> 01:22:15,310
might be,
you know,

1487
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:17,460
it's a relationship you could have the 
rest of your life and,

1488
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:20,320
and if you don't have it,
there's going to be a hole in your life.

1489
01:22:20,321 --> 01:22:23,170
You're always gonna wonder what the Hell
is going on with that person.

1490
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,453
So,

1491
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:33,483
okay,

1492
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,160
we are expecting our first eight,
Evan says,

1493
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,130
we are expecting our first child in me,
a daughter,

1494
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,483
and he's specific.
Any advice specific to raising 

1495
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:45,870
daughters?
Well,

1496
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:48,150
congratulations first.
So that's great.

1497
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,333
Um,

1498
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,253
okay.

1499
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,263
Let's see.
I'm just thinking about my daughter and 

1500
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:00,400
specific advice.

1501
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:10,840
I would say don't be afraid to support 
her masculine and feminine sides,

1502
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,453
you know?
And so the feminine side is you'll find 

1503
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:14,890
little girls.
No,

1504
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:17,260
not all little girls because some are 
more masculine than others.

1505
01:23:17,261 --> 01:23:19,150
But let's say you have a more feminine 
little girl.

1506
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,133
She's going to like to dress up,
but she's going to like to put on 

1507
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:22,414
jewelry.
It's amazing how much of that stuff 

1508
01:23:23,741 --> 01:23:26,530
seems to be implicit or a neat,
you know,

1509
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:29,560
and that can be really supported.
But then by the same token,

1510
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:30,394
it's nice to wrestle with your little 
girl kids and little kids really like 

1511
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:36,310
rough and tumble play into and to,
you know,

1512
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,550
encourage her to be courageous and 
forthright.

1513
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:40,563
And so if you're lucky you can,
you can support her in both elements of 

1514
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:45,070
her personality and that would be a 
really good thing to do.

1515
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:49,210
So
don't let her wrap.

1516
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:52,090
Are you around her little finger either?
That's another thing too.

1517
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,190
Were there any lectures or lectures 
series that you found helpful to you?

1518
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:02,800
This Nathan,
like yours have been to so many?

1519
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,053
Well,
Nathan,

1520
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:07,960
you know,
I would say not really.

1521
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,483
Um,
although,

1522
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,320
you know,
when I went,

1523
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:13,990
I went to this little college called 
Grand Prairie Regional College.

1524
01:24:13,991 --> 01:24:17,220
It was way the hell up in northern 
Alberta and um,

1525
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,903
there's only 600 people that went,
it was an adjunct of the University of 

1526
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,600
Alberta.
It's still exists.

1527
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:24,830
It's really lovely building.
Um,

1528
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,073
and we had professors there,
an English professor and a political 

1529
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,830
science professor in biology,
professor,

1530
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:33,664
philosophy professor,
people that I still remember little 

1531
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:36,454
seminars and they,
we got deeply into the material and I 

1532
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:42,250
really,
it really helped me a lot.

1533
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:43,084
This English professor really taught me 
to write to because he just slashed my 

1534
01:24:45,821 --> 01:24:46,654
essays to ribbons.
I was really upset the first time I got 

1535
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:52,530
a bad grade because I'd always got good 
grades and my papers in high school,

1536
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,220
even though they were dreadful.

1537
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,211
Um,
you know,

1538
01:24:55,211 --> 01:25:00,211
I was verbally intelligent enough to be 
able to compose an essay that was better

1539
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:04,480
than most with very little effort and 
with very little quality.

1540
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:05,763
And so that was very influential to me.
And I did a lot of reading under the 

1541
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:13,090
tutelage of those professors in these 
tiny little courses in my first year.

1542
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:17,410
But mostly what's been helpful to me 
have been books.

1543
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,020
And you know,
I read Nietzsche,

1544
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,410
I didn't read all of nature,
but I'll read all that was easily,

1545
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,483
easily accessible,
published works of nature in sequential 

1546
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:28,984
order in the order in which they were 
written when I was in my twenties and I 

1547
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,600
read everything that young had published
it when I was in my twenties and um,

1548
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,753
and,
and well and the same with a wide 

1549
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:39,274
variety of other authors.
And so those were like lecture series 

1550
01:25:40,931 --> 01:25:43,150
and they were,
I was unbelievably useful to me.

1551
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,130
I put some of those books on my reading 
this.

1552
01:25:45,131 --> 01:25:46,270
So,
um,

1553
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:49,283
could you please tell us your second 
ghost story as mentioned on h three h 

1554
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:55,380
three podcast.
God Nicholas,

1555
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,393
if you asked me that at the next q and a
and people voted up then I'll tell the 

1556
01:25:58,801 --> 01:25:59,634
story but I can't right now cause it's a
long story and I'm just about out of 

1557
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:06,020
voice and brain and time.
And that's,

1558
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,540
so I'm going to answer two more 
questions I think,

1559
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:12,860
and then I'm going to stop because I 
really am running out of,

1560
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:13,983
um,

1561
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,410
words.
Let's see.

1562
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,440
Okay.

1563
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,530
Kay.
He says,

1564
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,050
have you read much Thomas Soul?
In many ways,

1565
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:24,884
he filled your societal role for the 
last generation from a different 

1566
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,110
academic perspective.
I'm just reading his book right now.

1567
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:31,220
Um,
it's,

1568
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:32,750
what is it,
white.

1569
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,100
Okay.

1570
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,030
Black,
red Nixon,

1571
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:36,350
white liberals.
Is that right?

1572
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,710
Black rednecks and white liberals.

1573
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,233
Okay.

1574
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1575
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,570
I,
I'm,

1576
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,780
I'm still making my mind up about it.
It's quite a radical idea.

1577
01:26:50,781 --> 01:26:51,614
I mean in that book,
so claims that black urban culture is 

1578
01:26:55,611 --> 01:27:00,410
actually a derivative of southern 
cracker culture and that that in turn is

1579
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:05,411
a derivative of a rather dysfunctional 
highland dysfunctional British culture.

1580
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,723
What would you call rural called British
rural culture from a couple of hundred 

1581
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:13,183
years ago?
Um,

1582
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:14,803
I'm still thinking it through.
I find the book really interesting and 

1583
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:20,360
it wouldn't surprise me if it was true,
but it's quite original.

1584
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:22,280
The thesis is quite original.
So I'm,

1585
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,653
I'm working my way through that right 
now and I don't have anything much more 

1586
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,664
intelligent to say than that.
Can you share with us your reading 

1587
01:27:44,951 --> 01:27:46,120
habits?
Max says,

1588
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:48,250
I'm sorry,
I'm skipping over some questions,

1589
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:49,084
but I have to answer some easier ones 
because I'm out of the capacity to 

1590
01:27:52,031 --> 01:27:55,540
answer difficult ones.
Oh,

1591
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:56,374
I answered this one instead.
If you could talk to Donald Trump for a 

1592
01:27:58,940 --> 01:27:59,773
day,
what would you try to say or convinced 

1593
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:01,674
him about?
I don't think I would try to convince 

1594
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:04,394
them about things.
I don't actually try to convince people 

1595
01:28:06,651 --> 01:28:07,910
about things.
I don't think

1596
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:12,070
I tried to ask them.
I'd ask him a whole bunch of questions.

1597
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:15,400
I try to figure out how we thought 
because I'm really curious about that.

1598
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:17,980
I'd ask him all sorts of questions,
ask,

1599
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:19,750
see if I could find out what he was up 
to.

1600
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:20,613
I'd like to know what he's aiming at.
I'd like to know why he think he became 

1601
01:28:23,711 --> 01:28:25,120
president,
what he did right,

1602
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,860
what he did wrong,
what,

1603
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:27,703
what he dreads,
like what he would consider a 

1604
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:30,484
catastrophic failure,
where he thinks his biggest weaknesses 

1605
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,380
are,
what he'd like to leave as a,

1606
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,740
as a legacy.
Um,

1607
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:39,230
okay.

1608
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,030
That would be fascinating.
But see,

1609
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:45,950
I find generally speaking,
it's much more interesting to ask people

1610
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:48,350
questions,
especially people like that than ever to

1611
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:51,050
try to convince them of things.
Because the thing is,

1612
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:54,050
I already know what I know,
but I have no idea what he knows or what

1613
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:54,884
he's like.
And so it'd be amazing to be able to 

1614
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:57,283
talk to them.
And so I have a bit of that opportunity 

1615
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,670
now in Canada because I've been speaking
to a lot of political figures in Canada.

1616
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,470
I'm going to have that opportunity in 
Europe,

1617
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:05,304
but a lot of,
a lot of what you want to do when you 

1618
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:10,560
meet people as asked them questions 
because you know,

1619
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:12,450
they'll tell you all sorts of things you
don't know.

1620
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:13,284
And um,
that's also an entry point to a really 

1621
01:29:15,061 --> 01:29:17,760
good conversation is to ask questions.
So that's what I would do.

1622
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:20,910
I'd ask questions like mad until he 
chased me away.

1623
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,103
So

1624
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,290
one more.
Daniel,

1625
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:26,124
shall I like this question?
How would you give a speech to soldiers 

1626
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:29,124
entering the army about responsibility?
I will command at Basic Training Unit 

1627
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:34,290
and address young soldiers advice.
Daniel,

1628
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,690
what I would do is you can take about 
this,

1629
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,080
you could ask them to complete the 
future authoring program.

1630
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,000
I think that would be a really good 
idea.

1631
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:46,950
But if you don't want to do that,
but you should ask them to like get them

1632
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:47,784
to sit down for 90 minutes or an hour or
even I would use the future authoring 

1633
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:52,164
program cause it's just easier.
But ask them what sort of soldiers they 

1634
01:29:56,311 --> 01:29:57,144
want to be in three to five years.
If they could put themselves together 

1635
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,893
and be the best military and serve the 
purpose that they enrolled in the 

1636
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:08,340
military for in the best possible 
manner,

1637
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,120
what would they look like as their own 
future ideal?

1638
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,760
They have to think it through.
So,

1639
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:17,410
and then the other thing you can ask 
them,

1640
01:30:17,411 --> 01:30:18,244
and this is also part of the future 
authoring program is like what would 

1641
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:23,220
your life look like three to five years 
down the road?

1642
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:26,520
If you fail in your,
in your desire to,

1643
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:27,923
to become a proper soldier.
What sort of hell are you courting by 

1644
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,663
failing to take on the responsibility.
And if you can get them to think that 

1645
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:36,210
through,
you know,

1646
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:39,360
the probability that they'll do a good 
job will vastly increase,

1647
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,223
really vastly increase.
Lots of young people have never thought 

1648
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:46,170
about who it is that they could be if 
they started to be the person they could

1649
01:30:46,171 --> 01:30:47,004
be.
And so getting them to think about that 

1650
01:30:48,571 --> 01:30:50,280
write about it would be extremely 
important.

1651
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:51,114
So what I would do first of all is get 
them to do the writing and the thinking 

1652
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,170
and then give the speech.
And maybe once they've done it,

1653
01:30:59,130 --> 01:30:59,963
you know,
you could ask them if they'd be willing 

1654
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:03,240
to share with you some of what they've 
written.

1655
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:04,074
I wouldn't make that mandatory because 
then they might not be able to write 

1656
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:08,310
about it honestly.
So that's how it would go about it.

1657
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:11,370
So.
Okay.

1658
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,740
Well I'm done.
So,

1659
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:14,663
um,
thank you very much for tuning in and 

1660
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:21,180
thank you all for your support and um,

1661
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,480
keep,
what else?

1662
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,213
I hope that
I have lots of plans for 2018 and I 

1663
01:31:33,771 --> 01:31:37,430
would like to keep you all in the loop.
And so all posts a lot of those.

1664
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,230
Oh yes.
I should tell you this.

1665
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,900
I'm going to be giving some public 
talks,

1666
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,823
a bunch of them.
So I'm going to be in the following 

1667
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:48,470
places in January,
February and March.

1668
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,120
Um,
I'll try to say them in order.

1669
01:31:50,121 --> 01:31:50,954
I'm going to be in London and then I'm 
going to be in Amsterdam and then I'm 

1670
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:56,630
going to be in New York,

1671
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,760
Los Angeles,
San Francisco,

1672
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:01,923
maybe Oakland.
Then I'm going to be in a bunch of 

1673
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:07,000
cities across Canada,
in major cities,

1674
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,140
Winnipeg,
Edmonton,

1675
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,060
Ottawa,
Calgary,

1676
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,013
maybe this little town,
grand prairie that I went to college in 

1677
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,863
Vancouver.
And then I'm going to go down to 

1678
01:32:16,091 --> 01:32:19,390
Australia and I'm going to go to 
Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane.

1679
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,960
And so I'll post
the dates on my website very soon.

1680
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:29,230
I'm still making the arrangements.
And so if you want to come and listen to

1681
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:30,064
me talk,
then you'll have the opportunity to do 

1682
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:34,210
so and so.
Okay.

1683
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,630
So I have to say good night.
And so good night to all of you.

1684
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:38,464
And,
uh,

1685
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:44,340
what would I like to close with?
Well,

1686
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:46,804
I'm glad you're tuning in and I hope 
that you're using the information that 

1687
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:57,310
you're finding as a consequence of 
tuning in to put your lives together,

1688
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:58,173
because it would really be good in 2018 
if a whole bunch of people did 

1689
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:03,874
everything they could to put their lives
together because then maybe we could 

1690
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:11,200
avoid this idiot catastrophe that we 
seem to be dreadfully sliding towards.

1691
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,260
And so that would be lovely if we could 
just not do that.

1692
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:17,260
So until next time,
bye bye.
