Hi there,
it's only about a week before Christmas 

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:04,904
and some of you are no doubt scrambling 
to determine what might make an 

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:13,100
appropriate Christmas gift.
As you may know or also may not.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,963
I have written a book that's coming out 
in January on January 23rd as a matter 

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:22,301
of fact called 12 rules for life and 
antidote to chaos and it's possible that

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,760
some of the people you know might be 
interested in receiving that as a gift.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,360
However,
a promise to get a book a month later,

8
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,520
it doesn't make a great Christmas gift.
Exactly.

9
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,354
So what I've done is put together a 
small package that announces that the 

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,604
book has been ordered that has a short 
letter in it for me and also that 

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,710
contains the introduction to the book 
about 10 pages,

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,610
which I called over tour.
You could order the book online from any

13
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:54,080
of the vendors to whom I have provided a
link in the description of the video and

14
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:54,914
you could also download the package I 
produced and print it out to make the 

15
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,840
gift more tangible and therefore more 
well solid and appreciated,

16
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,600
I would say.
And then you could put it in an envelope

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,900
and you can give that little package as 
a gift,

18
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,734
and maybe that would be more appropriate
than a mere indication that the book is 

19
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,510
on its way.
So I hope that's useful.

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,790
Thank you all for tuning in over the 
last year and before that,

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,624
and for all the support you've offered 
to be in the last year and a merry 

22
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,760
Christmas and happy new year.

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,923
Yes.
