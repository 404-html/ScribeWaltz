1
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,443
Today,
we're going to talk a little bit more 

2
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,520
about the fractionation of openness to 
experience.

3
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,680
And
we've done a fair number of studies with

4
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:26,020
the big five aspect scale,
which we've talked about a lot,

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,050
which enables the big five model to be 
differentiated down into two aspects per

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,490
trait.
And those aspects have been useful for a

7
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,540
variety of reasons.
For example,

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,700
when we're looking at political 
behavior,

9
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:44,701
we've been able to determine that 
conservatives who are generally regarded

10
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,694
as higher in conscientiousness are 
actually more specifically higher in 

11
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:49,684
orderliness,
is not a lot of difference between 

12
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,370
liberals and conservatives with regards 
to industriousness.

13
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,204
And we've also been able to determine at
least to some degree that orderliness 

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,913
seems to be associated with disgust,
sensitivity and disgust sensitivity as 

15
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:04,774
part of the behavioral immune system.
And so part of the reasons that 

16
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,774
conservatives are more inclined to want 
things like closed borders is because 

17
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,860
they're more concerned about maintaining
the boundaries between things.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,810
And the reason for that seems to be 
fundamentally associated with disgust.

19
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,644
And I'll talk to you a lot about that 
next week because once we sorted that 

20
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,420
out,
it really,

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,860
really illuminated my way of thinking 
about things that had happened.

22
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,680
For example,
in Nazi Germany because people tend to,

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,963
people tend to think about like when 
people have been studying conservatism 

24
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,183
from a scientific perspective,
they've tended to assume that it's 

25
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:45,520
associated with fear of the outgroup say
and it conservatives are more fearful to

26
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,354
liberals,
but that actually doesn't seem to be 

27
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,580
conservatives are not hiring trait 
neuroticism.

28
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:51,414
And that's a really tough one because if
you are going to make a case that a 

29
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,490
group one group is more anxious let's 
say,

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,324
or threat sensitive than another and you
don't get differences in trait 

31
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,410
neuroticism,
then you've really got a problem

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
over political versus well yeah,
but the theories,

33
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,310
the theories seem to be more trait like 
rather than situation.

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,293
Yeah.
So,

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
so,
but what we have found is that that,

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,253
you know,
for a long time people thought that all 

37
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,210
of the negative emotions loaded on 
neuroticism and it was like the global,

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,460
it was the global trade for negative 
emotion,

39
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,640
but discussed seems to be its own 
peculiar thing.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,013
And uh,
but I will talk to you more about that 

41
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,834
next week and,
but that's just an example of why 

42
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,350
differentiation at the aspect level 
seems useful.

43
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,184
You also pick up differences between men
and women at the aspect level that 

44
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,900
aren't obvious at the trait level as 
well.

45
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,860
So you can think about the model says,
you know,

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,423
you have a model that operates at 
different levels of resolution and low 

47
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,084
resolution representations are good for 
one set of operations in higher 

48
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,680
resolution representations are good for 
other purposes.

49
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,810
And the purpose of course is to predict 
these.

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,900
That's one of the primary scientific 
purposes.

51
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,183
And so you pick the level of analysis 
that gives you the most prediction and 

52
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,340
perhaps also the most utility in terms 
of formulating scientific theories.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,653
So,
and so we'll concentrate a little bit 

54
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,470
more today on openness per se.
So openness to experience fragments into

55
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,400
intellect and openness proper.
And I think the right way to think about

56
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,210
intellect is that it's the personality 
instantiation of Iq,

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,520
roughly speaking.
And the reason I think that is because,

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,593
well first of all,
working memory predicts intellect quite 

59
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,700
nicely and working memory tests are 
very,

60
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,534
very highly correlated with g and s 
specifically g being the first factor 

61
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,810
that you pull out of any set of Iq 
tests,

62
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,644
right?
That that's the technical definition of 

63
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,800
GE.
You set up sis,

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,120
uh,
sets of questions,

65
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,820
do a factor analysis and extract out the
first factor,

66
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,780
which is roughly equivalent by the way,
to the total or to that to two,

67
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,280
the mean of the,
of the items,

68
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,380
if it's,
if there's a one factor solution,

69
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,970
it's not much different than the 
average.

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,980
So the average is actually a factor.
That's that,

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,873
that where the hypothesis is that every 
single item loads equally on that 

72
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,931
factor,
right?

73
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,240
Because you're adding them all up and 
then dividing them by the number.

74
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,420
So it's no different than a factor 
analysis.

75
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,263
Sometimes you'll hear people like 
Stephen Jay Gould did this when he was 

76
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:23,020
complaining about Iq back in the 90s he 
said of factor a factor analysis.

77
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,270
Like a factor is just a mathematical 
abstraction.

78
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,980
It's like,
well yeah,

79
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,903
so is the average.
You think it'd be average of a set of 

80
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,350
numbers real and answer that question 
is,

81
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,640
it depends on how you define real.
You can use it for certain functions,

82
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,250
which is a pretty good definition of 
real as far as I'm concerned.

83
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,470
But when,
when you ask questions like that,

84
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,663
you have to define both your terms and 
you do that somewhat arbitrarily 

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,413
anyways.

86
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,660
People with high iqs tend to think that 
they're smart,

87
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,523
which is that's right.
And so then they tend to describe 

88
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,954
themselves as smart.
If you give them the opportunity to do 

89
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,680
that.
And then that shows up when you ask them

90
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
questions about their problem solving 
ability and that loads mostly on 

91
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,114
intellect.
And so it isn't even obvious that 

92
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,964
there's any real utility in assessing 
intellect from the self report 

93
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,194
perspective when you could replace that 
with an Iq test because the Iq test is 

94
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:13,780
way more accurate.
So,

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,913
but that gives you some sense.
You think about the whole five factor 

96
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:17,561
model,
you know,

97
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,440
where intelligence slots,
slots in underneath openness,

98
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,760
the openness,
proper part of openness to experience,

99
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,594
which,
which I tend to think about as 

100
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,180
creativity.
You can use that at least as a shorthand

101
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,200
to sort of aid your understanding in 
what it is.

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,333
Creativity seems related to Iq in that 
more people with higher iqs are likely 

103
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,764
to be creative.
Or if you take people who are noted for 

104
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,524
their creativity,
there's a high probability that they'll 

105
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,360
have a higher Iq,
but there's more to it than Iq.

106
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,280
Um,
and,

107
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,293
and what,
what creativity seems to be associated 

108
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,300
with then again depends on whether or 
not how in how you define creativity.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,433
Because you could define it as the sum 
total of creative achievements that 

110
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,064
you've made in your life,
which would be the actual production of 

111
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,243
say,
artifacts of one form or another 

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,820
performances or inventions or artworks 
or,

113
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,290
or,
or what have you.

114
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,510
We'll go over the dimensions in the 
middle in a minute.

115
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,763
Or You could also define it as the 
proclivity to engage in creative 

116
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,840
thought.
And I think we'll start with that first.

117
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,970
So what does it mean to think 
creatively?

118
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,560
It's,
it's sort of like,

119
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,293
it's something like this.
Imagine that I tossed you out an idea 

120
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,483
and there's some probability that when I
taught you that idea that that will 

121
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,530
trigger off other ideas in your 
imagination.

122
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,720
So you could think about it as a 
threshold issue.

123
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,823
If you're not very creative,
I'll throw you an idea and hardly any 

124
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,464
other ideas will be triggered.
And the ones that will be triggered are 

125
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:45,050
going to be very closely associated with
that initial idea.

126
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,490
So let's say I tossed each of you an 
idea and I asked you to think,

127
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,200
tell me the first thing that comes to 
mind.

128
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,183
Okay.
So what we would see first is that the 

129
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,914
first thing that comes to mind for you,
the first thing that comes to mind in 

130
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,680
like in all likelihood would be shared 
by many of you.

131
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,113
Okay?
So then you could think about that as a 

132
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,070
common response,
right?

133
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,903
And so that's a less creative response.
And then there'll be some things that 

134
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,534
come to mind for you that are,
that are so idiosyncratic that you're 

135
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,090
the only person that thinks that and no 
one can understand it.

136
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,080
Well that that's also not exactly 
creative because the thing that you,

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,333
for something to be creative,
it has to be novel and useful at the 

138
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,510
same time.
That's sort of a rough definition,

139
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,900
creative,
something creative is novel and useful.

140
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,250
And obviously,
you know,

141
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:28,970
there,
there's a,

142
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,720
there's a certain amount of judgment 
that goes along with that clearly,

143
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,883
but if it's too novel then no one else 
can understand it and it's unlikely to 

144
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,450
be useful.
So there's,

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,790
there's a,
there's a range of convenience.

146
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,863
So anyways,
if you want to decide if something is 

147
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:45,170
creative,
like what we would do for,

148
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,280
I could say to you,
uh,

149
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,114
okay,
in the next three minutes I want you to 

150
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:51,530
write down all of the uses you can think
of for a brick.

151
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,461
So,
okay.

152
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:57,461
So someone tells me to use for a brick
breaking windows.

153
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,330
Yes.
Okay.

154
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,320
At what else can use a brick for
build a wall.

155
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:09,710
It's very small wall,
a wall for ants.

156
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,400
And what else?
Paperweight.

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,800
Okay.
Okay.

158
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,380
Well,
so you get the idea.

159
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,920
Now,
you're not feeling very mouthy today,

160
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,130
obviously,
but so,

161
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,320
so you see that.
So if we gathered your responses,

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,513
say I said you have to think of 20 items
that 20 things that that you could do 

163
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,144
with a brick,
then a bunch of the things that you 

164
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,354
thought would be the same and some 
people would come up with something 

165
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,780
different.
Like yours was reasonably different.

166
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,030
The one about using it as a pumice stone
for your feet,

167
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
that's someone else might've come up 
with that.

168
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,274
But it's,
it's a good creative response because 

169
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,140
it's unexpected and it,
you could actually do it,

170
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,300
you know?
So anyways,

171
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,180
so you'll get a graph of probability of 
response,

172
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,043
right?

173
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,630
And the more probable,
the less creative,

174
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,340
roughly speaking,
it's not the only criteria though,

175
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,900
because you also have to look at 
utility.

176
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,460
So if I said,
okay,

177
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,294
you've got three minutes to write down 
as many uses as you can think of for a 

178
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,650
brick,
I would score that in a variety of ways.

179
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,730
The first thing I would do is just 
figure out how many uses you generated.

180
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,320
That's called fluency.
And we could also do that.

181
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,330
I could just say write down as many 
words as you can.

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,193
Begin with the letter s in three minutes
or that begin with the letter c or four 

183
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,910
letter words that begin with the letter 
d.

184
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,600
No,
I can,

185
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,433
I can constrain it.
And if I counted how many words you 

186
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:22,854
generated,
if I had an Iq measure and I had a 

187
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,004
measure of how many words you generated,
Iq plus the number of words that you 

188
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,010
generated would be a better predictor of
your creativity.

189
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,400
Then just Iq.
So there's this fluency element that's,

190
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,700
and so that's something like the rate at
which you can produce,

191
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,250
say verbal ideas.
And one of the things we do know about,

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,193
about the creativity dimension of,
of openness is that it is associated 

193
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,740
with fluency and it's also associated 
with originality.

194
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,574
And originality would be how improbable 
your use was compared to the uses 

195
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,320
generated by other people.
So,

196
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,920
so anyway,
so you can think of you,

197
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,773
you get thrown in idea and there's some 
probability that that will go activate 

198
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,630
other ideas and if it coactivators many 
other ideas,

199
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:11,280
that's like fluency and if it coactive 
eights ideas that are quite distant from

200
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,020
the original idea,
something like that.

201
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:16,440
And you could,
you could track distance by comparing it

202
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,860
to two probability that other people 
have generated it.

203
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,170
Then that's also another indication of 
creativity.

204
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,030
So they have to be unlikely risk.

205
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,080
Many unlikely responses that are useful.
That's what creativity is,

206
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,943
roughly speaking.
And then you can fractionated into 

207
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,880
different dimensions.
So that's creative thinking.

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
But then creative achievement would be 
the ability to take those original ideas

209
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,330
and then actually to implement them in 
the world.

210
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,060
And that's obviously much more different
than merely being creative.

211
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,343
And so,
and then what creativity is depends on 

212
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,390
which of those measurement routes that 
you take.

213
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,360
Now I developed a questionnaire with one
of my students,

214
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,970
Shelly Carson about,
gees,

215
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,340
it's just about 30 years ago now,
20 years ago,

216
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,174
I guess,
called the creative achievement 

217
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,094
questionnaire.
And I'll show you that here and I'll 

218
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,680
show you some of the things that,
that are interesting about it.

219
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,671
Um,
you know,

220
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,910
you hear a very frequently people say 
things like everyone's creative.

221
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,590
It's like that's wrong.
Okay,

222
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,573
it's wrong.
It's just as wrong as saying that 

223
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,710
everyone's extroverted.

224
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,903
First of all,
you have to be pretty damn smart to be 

225
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,794
creative because otherwise you're just 
going to get to where other people have 

226
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,230
already got.
And that's not creative by definition.

227
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:25,440
So,
so be in fast and being out there at the

228
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,940
front of things really makes a 
difference.

229
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,774
And then you also have to have these 
divergent thinking capabilities and 

230
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,120
that's part of your traits.
Structure and creative people are really

231
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,260
different than non creative people,
you know,

232
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,153
partly because for example,
they're highly motivated to do creative 

233
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,450
things and to experience novelty and to,
and to,

234
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,403
and to chase down aesthetic experiences.
Intuit 10 movies into read fiction and 

235
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,140
to go to museums and to enjoy poetry 
and,

236
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,000
and,
and to enjoy music.

237
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,070
That's not conventional music,
for example.

238
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,650
These aren't trivial differences.
And so and so.

239
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,484
It's a real,
it's a real miss statement to make the 

240
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,210
proposition that everyone's creative.

241
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,210
It's just simply not the case.
It's a matter of wishful thinking.

242
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,490
It's like saying that everyone's 
intelligent.

243
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:06,941
It's like,
well,

244
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,774
if everyone's intelligent,
then the term loses all of its meaning 

245
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,540
because any term that you can apply to 
every member of a category,

246
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,230
obs has absolutely no meaning.
Now that doesn't end.

247
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,083
You know?
The other thing you want to be thinking 

248
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,760
about here is that don't be thinking 
that creativity is such a good thing.

249
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,340
It's a high risk,
high return strategy,

250
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,680
so if you're creative,
you just try this.

251
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,210
There's creative people in this room,
man,

252
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,180
you guys are going to have a hell of a 
time monetizing your creativity.

253
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,280
It's virtually impossible.
It's really,

254
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,820
really difficult because first of all,
let's say you make an original product,

255
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,400
you think the world will beat a pathway 
to your door.

256
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,690
If you build a better mouse trap.

257
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,670
It's like that's complete rubbish.
It isn't.

258
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,050
It isn't true in the least.
If you make a good creative product,

259
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,150
you've probably solved about 5% of your 
problem because then you have marketing,

260
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:52,984
which is insanely difficult.
And then you have sales and then you 

261
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,714
have customer support and then you have 
to build an organization and you have 

262
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,430
to,
if it's really novel,

263
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,890
you have to tell people what the hell 
the thing is.

264
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,230
You know,
we built this future authoring program,

265
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,960
right?
And it's available for people online.

266
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,810
It's how do you market that?
No one knows what that is.

267
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:11,644
And that's a real problem.
If he wrote a book while then you have 

268
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,180
the problem that another million people 
have also written a book.

269
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,253
But if you produce something that's 
completely new and doesn't have a 

270
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,430
category,
people can't search for it online,

271
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:22,480
how are they going to find it?

272
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,860
So you,
you just have,

273
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,753
and then you have pricing problems and 
it's really unbelievably difficult to 

274
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,940
produce something creative and then 
monetize it.

275
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,310
And even worse,
if you're the creative person,

276
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,260
let's say you have a spectacular 
invention,

277
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,970
you've got no money,
right?

278
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,370
You've got no customers.
Those are big problems.

279
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,860
And so maybe you go and you find a 
venture capitalist.

280
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,110
We start with family and friends because
that's how it works.

281
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:44,944
He raised money for your product.
You raise money from your family and 

282
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,464
friends.
That's assuming you have family and 

283
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:52,480
friends that have some money and that 
they're going to give it to you and most

284
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,720
people aren't in that situation.
So it's a terrible barrier right off the

285
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,554
bat.
And then of course you're putting your 

286
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,234
family and friends.
It's substantial financial risk because 

287
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,850
the probability that you're stupid idea 
is going to make money is virtually zero

288
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,890
even if it's a really brilliant idea.

289
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,040
And so then let's say,
well you get past family and friends and

290
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,874
you get venture capitalists,
capitalists involved cause that's often 

291
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:15,100
the next step or an angel investor 
that's there's,

292
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,770
there's steps in building a business 
family and friends,

293
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:22,060
Angel investor that some rich guy that 
you happened to meet some manner is some

294
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,310
way.
Who's who's into this sort of thing.

295
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,144
Is is willing to provide you with some 
money to get your product off the 

296
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,324
ground?
Well how much of your product is that 

297
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,680
person going to take?
Well,

298
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,810
most of it,
most of it.

299
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,883
And then if you get a venture and no 
wonder because you know you don't have 

300
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,990
any money,
how are you going to bargain for control

301
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,610
over your product?
He'll just say,

302
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,350
well,
do you want the money or not?

303
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,830
And if your answer is no,
then he'll go and do something else with

304
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,190
his money.

305
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,430
It's not like there's no shortage of 
things that you can do with your money.

306
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,320
There's a million things you can do with
it,

307
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,090
so you're not in a great bargaining 
position.

308
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,430
And then if you get venture capitalists 
involved,

309
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,264
they'll take another big chunk.
And maybe if they're not very straight 

310
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,870
with you,
they'll just throw you out.

311
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,540
Because maybe by that point in the 
company's development,

312
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,330
you're nothing but a pain in the neck.
Because what do you know about marketing

313
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,343
and sales and customer service and 
building an organization and running a 

314
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,060
business?
Like you don't have a clue.

315
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:14,894
So why do they need you?
So even if you're a successful at 

316
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:21,170
generating a new idea and you put it 
into a business,

317
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,780
the probability that you as the 
originator of the,

318
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,960
of the idea are going to make some money
from it is very,

319
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:27,800
very low.

320
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,470
So don't be thinking that creativity is 
such a,

321
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,573
it's such a,
it's something you would want to curse 

322
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,430
yourself with.
Now,

323
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,623
you know,
it's not all bad because it opens up 

324
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,113
avenues of experience for creative 
people that aren't available to people 

325
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,160
who aren't creative.
But it definitely is a high risk,

326
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,130
high return strategy,
you know?

327
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,290
So the overwhelming probability is that 
you will fail,

328
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,690
but a small proportion of creative 
people succeed spectacularly.

329
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,360
And so it's like a lottery in some 
sense.

330
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,640
You're probably gonna lose,
but if you don't lose,

331
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,474
you could win big.
And that keeps a lot of creative people 

332
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:02,204
going.
But also they don't really have much 

333
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,420
choice in it because if you're a 
creative person,

334
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:05,980
you're like,
uh,

335
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,750
uh,
a fruit tree that's,

336
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,950
that's bearing fruit.
So you don't really have,

337
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,410
you can suppress it,
but it's very bad for you.

338
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,653
You know,
the creative people I've worked with as 

339
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,400
if they're not creative,
they're miserable.

340
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,650
So they have to do it.
But,

341
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,200
and,
and you know,

342
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,480
there's real joy and pleasure in it and,
and,

343
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,580
and,
and psychological utility.

344
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,490
But that doesn't necessarily mean that 
it's an intelligent,

345
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,713
it's certainly not a conservative 
strategy for moving forward through 

346
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,110
life.
So,

347
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,603
and you know,
whenever I talk to people who are 

348
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,610
creative and you,
you guys should listen to this because I

349
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,220
know what I'm talking about.
If you happen to be creative,

350
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,700
if you're a songwriter or another kind 
of musician or an artist or,

351
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,534
or,
or any of the other number of things 

352
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,754
that you might be,
find a way to make money and then 

353
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:54,710
practice your craft on the side because 
you will starve to death otherwise.

354
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,780
Now some for some of you that won't be 
true,

355
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,614
but it's a tiny minority.
You're best bet is to find a job that 

356
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,734
will keep body and soul together and 
parse off some time that you can pursue 

357
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,180
your creative thing.

358
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,560
Because then,
well,

359
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,260
as a longterm strategy of medium to 
longterm strategy,

360
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,094
it's a better one.
But it's got incredibly difficult for 

361
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,920
people.
Musicians,

362
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:13,754
for example,
it's incredibly difficult for new 

363
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,020
musicians to monetize their,
their craft,

364
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,430
even if they're really,
really good at it.

365
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,530
So it's,
it's,

366
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,311
well,
so anyway,

367
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,780
so don't be,
so I say,

368
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,850
well everyone's not,
everyone's not creative.

369
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:26,571
And everybody goes,
oh,

370
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,590
that's terrible.
It's like,

371
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,360
it's not so terrible.
It's not something,

372
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,194
it's not self evident that you would 
curse someone with high levels of 

373
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:33,860
creativity.
So,

374
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,423
all right,
so here's how our creative achievement 

375
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:37,604
questionnaire works.
What we did essentially was we thought 

376
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:44,090
up how many domains there are in which 
you might be creative.

377
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,243
And this is,
remember when you're designing a 

378
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,084
questionnaire,
you want to be over inclusive because 

379
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,830
the statistics will take care of it,
right?

380
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:52,670
So you can,
you can take a big area of,

381
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,360
of,
of potential.

382
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,433
You can take a large area and aim your 
questionnaire at it and you can do 

383
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:01,140
statistics post hoc to see if you're 
covering the area.

384
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,130
If,
if,

385
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,680
if the things that you're measuring or 
nicely correlated there,

386
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,240
this,
you know,

387
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,073
there,
there's something about them that's 

388
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:08,100
similar.
If they're not correlated,

389
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:08,934
then maybe you're measuring two 
different things and you can get rid of 

390
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:11,700
one of them.
That's fine.

391
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,070
So we did start with a pretty wide 
range.

392
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:14,551
We thought,
okay,

393
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,980
well what domains can you be creative 
in?

394
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,170
Visual Arts,
painting and sculpture.

395
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,033
Then we had experts sort of rank order 
levels of achievement within those 

396
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,504
domains.
And so if you are a painter you could 

397
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,963
zero gives you,
I have no training or recognized talent 

398
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,850
in this area.
Okay,

399
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,860
so you really want to keep an eye on the
Zeros.

400
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,040
All right,
so then I've taken lessons.

401
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,720
People have commented on my talents.

402
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,553
I have won a prize.
My work has been critiqued in national 

403
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,430
publications.
All right,

404
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,870
so you get,
you get,

405
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,920
you get zero to seven points,
but you can indicate more than,

406
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,883
you know,
maybe that's happened to you more than 

407
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,980
once.
So,

408
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:50,814
and what happens,
this is interesting and is that the 

409
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:53,754
higher you are up in this hierarchy,
the more likely it is that those things 

410
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,800
have happened to you more than once.
And that's,

411
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,903
that's another example of this weird 
thing called the pareto principle or 

412
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,624
price's law.
Which is that it's sort of as good 

413
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:07,464
things happen to you,
that probability that more good things 

414
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,050
will happen.
Increases,

415
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,390
right?
So because once you're famous,

416
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,850
people give you all sorts of 
opportunities to do other things,

417
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:15,780
right?
So your,

418
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,614
your,
your success doesn't go like this goes 

419
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,790
like this zero zero,
zero skyrocket.

420
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,350
That's how it works.

421
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,470
But getting from zero to getting from 
zero to one,

422
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,513
if you're starting a business,
the hardest customer you'll ever get is 

423
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,334
your first one.
And then the second hardest one will be 

424
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,210
your second one.
It's virtually impossible to get a first

425
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:34,950
customer because they're going to say to
you,

426
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,020
first of all,
you're going to be selling to people who

427
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:40,500
are basically conservative and they're 
not going to be evaluate.

428
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,280
They're not going to be willing or able 
to evaluate whether your damn product is

429
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,570
good for anything.
And so they'll say,

430
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,720
well who are your other customers?
And if your answer to that is,

431
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,450
well we don't have any.
It's like well then why they're going to

432
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,160
be the first one.
No,

433
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,620
because people don't stick their necks 
out at all.

434
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,370
Not a bit ever.
And so unless you're well established in

435
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:00,204
the market,
especially if you're dealing with a big 

436
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,120
company,
you can just bloody well forget it.

437
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
It's like a three year sales cycle 
anyways,

438
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,190
it's re because big corporations move 
very,

439
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,024
very slowly.
And you might be able to find a small 

440
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,274
company that doesn't have much money,
who would be willing to use your stupid 

441
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:14,184
product for nothing.
If you're really nice to them and you 

442
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,630
get one customer that way,
it's very,

443
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,730
very difficult.
And so you'll,

444
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,900
you'll end up,
you know.

445
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,750
And what do you think the royalty,
just out of curiosity,

446
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,584
so I've written a book,
it's going to be published by penguin 

447
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,580
random house in,
in January.

448
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,560
What do you think the royalty is for an 
author on a book?

449
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,010
So you make something creative,
you get a percentage of the sale.

450
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:37,800
What do you think the percentages,
just out of curiosity?

451
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,520
Guests?
Yeah,

452
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:42,354
it's like 5% so think about that.
So that means that you make your thing 

453
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,644
and 95% of it belongs to someone else.
And that's if things are going quite 

454
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,314
well for you.
And it doesn't really matter what you 

455
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,190
manufacture or produce.
That's about what you can expect.

456
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,330
Sales,
marketing,

457
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,350
distribution,
it eats,

458
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,040
he eats it all up so,
so well anyways,

459
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,560
you need to know these things because 
they're not self evident.

460
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,580
Okay,
so

461
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,880
seems to be working all by itself.

462
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,990
All right,
so let's take a look.

463
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,843
Well,
how else can you have creative 

464
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,660
achievement?
Well,

465
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,480
you can be a musician.
I have no training or recognized talent.

466
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,240
Recordings of my composition have been 
sold publicly.

467
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,970
That's the top end.
My composition has been copyrighted,

468
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:20,804
recorded,
critiqued in local population pop 

469
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,413
publication.
I have composed an original piece of 

470
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,790
music.
Well,

471
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,624
let's try this.
How many of you have composed an 

472
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,840
original piece of music?
Wow,

473
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,150
there's lots of creative people in here 
that's very impressive.

474
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,490
So there must be 10 or 11 people in 
here.

475
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,623
Oh,
that's cool.

476
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,100
So how about,
uh,

477
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,563
your,
your copies of composition has been 

478
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:43,460
copyrighted.
How about it's been,

479
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,240
the recordings have been sold publicly 
and actually sold.

480
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,223
How many people?

481
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,380
Two.
Two.

482
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,721
Okay.
Well.

483
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:55,170
So what you can see is there's a rapid 
drop off in the number of people who say

484
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,280
yes.
How many of you fit into categories?

485
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,114
Zero.
I have no training or recognized talent 

486
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,174
in this area.

487
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,390
Yeah,
okay.

488
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,170
Okay.

489
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,420
Zero is the median score on all of 
these.

490
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,703
Median is the score.
That's the most likely for people to 

491
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:09,051
have,
right?

492
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:11,540
It's different than the mean.
Median score is zero.

493
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,613
So what's the median score and the 
entire creative achievement 

494
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,070
questionnaire?
Zero.

495
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,850
You,
you add up all over all 13 domains.

496
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:24,140
The most typical score is zero.
So that's how creative people are.

497
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,530
There's zero creative,
not at all.

498
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,573
Yes,

499
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,700
certainly that everybody has a certain 
degree of creativity,

500
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,690
but for the most part,

501
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,300
most of them are not really creative and
all.

502
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,940
The thing is you could say that people 
have people,

503
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,850
all people are creative and that all 
people can generate ideas,

504
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,040
but the issue isn't whether or not you 
can generate ideas.

505
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:46,874
It's whether or not you can generate 
ideas that are different from the ideas 

506
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:49,664
that other people generate.
That's the critical issue because I 

507
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,960
didn't mean it depends on how you define
it.

508
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:56,690
You can,
while the novelty is a huge part of it,

509
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:57,524
but that's it.
That sort of built into the definition 

510
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,250
of creative.
It has to be novel and useful.

511
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,084
And if your idea that you generate is 
the same as the idea that a bunch of 

512
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,290
other people have,
it's not,

513
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,790
it's an idea.
Fair enough.

514
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,520
And if you define creativity that way,
then everyone's creative.

515
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,150
But it's a foolish way of defining 
creativity because everyone does it.

516
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,230
And we know that there has to be 
something novel about creativity.

517
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,440
Um,
these categories all seem to be artistic

518
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,330
as well as requiring specific of skills.
For example,

519
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,940
the music and answer choir,
mechanical motor fields.

520
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,900
Are there ways to be creative outside of
the artistic director?

521
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,020
Well,
let's go through the rest of the domains

522
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,450
because we did include domains that 
aren't,

523
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,840
that aren't and yes,
there are,

524
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,120
engineering is a good example of that or
writing nonfiction,

525
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,213
they,
those things tend to tilt more in the 

526
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:53,324
intellect direction.
But I'm concentrating most particularly 

527
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,624
here on the sort of creativity that 
would be a soap associated with 

528
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,040
openness.
So yeah.

529
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,170
Okay.
So dance,

530
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,940
well it's,
it's roughly the same as music,

531
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,774
so we won't,
we won't move forward into that 

532
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,740
architectural design.
My architectural design,

533
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,580
my architectural design has been 
recognized in a national publication,

534
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,414
creative writing.
My work has been reviewed in national 

535
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,830
publications.
Million books sold last year.

536
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,010
250 of them sold more than a hundred 
thousand copies.

537
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,750
Right.
So that's another,

538
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,540
that's another example of high risk,
high return.

539
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,840
So probably you won't write a book.
If you write a book,

540
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,360
probably no one would publish it.
If you publish it,

541
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,150
almost certainly no one will buy it.

542
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,160
So you see,
you see what I mean?

543
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,120
There's,
there's exclusion.

544
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,840
The exclusion criteria there are so are 
so thoroughly,

545
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,720
they're so difficult because it's very 
difficult to write a book,

546
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,554
even a bad one.
You have to work a long time to write a 

547
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,374
bad book and then your book has to be 
pretty damn good before you're going to 

548
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,230
get it published.
And,

549
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,510
and you also have to know about know how
to go about getting it published.

550
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,550
That's all.
So you don't send a book to a publisher,

551
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,530
by the way,
they don't want your stupid book.

552
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,210
They want a summary of the book,
they want an outline of the book,

553
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,133
they want three chapters of the book,
they want to know who the hell you are 

554
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:09,344
and why anyone should listen to you.
They want to know what other books your 

555
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,940
book is like.
And most importantly,

556
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,380
perhaps they want to know where it would
sit in a bookshelf in a bookstore.

557
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,400
And the reason for that is that,
and I have trouble this has trouble with

558
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,710
the books that I write is no one who was
where to put them.

559
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,723
That's a big problem because then the 
marketing people don't know how to 

560
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,244
market them.
And maybe that's because they're more 

561
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,940
creative than usual.
It doesn't matter if there isn't a place

562
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:34,010
that you can put the book where people 
can find it,

563
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,470
then you're not going to publish it.
And even if you do,

564
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,450
you can't sell it because no one can 
find it.

565
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,480
So you just think about the difficulties
in being a successful author.

566
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,910
You're not going to write a book.
It's too hard.

567
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,130
There's no damn way you're going to get 
it published,

568
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:46,964
and if you do,
it probably won't be a very good 

569
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:48,494
publisher.
Then they have to do a really good job 

570
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,200
of selling it and marketing it.

571
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,010
Then you have to enter the,
the the market at the right time,

572
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,993
right?
And then you have to be reviewed by the 

573
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,750
right people and then it has to be put 
in the right places.

574
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,860
It's like most,
what happens is your book,

575
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,700
we'll go out for a week.
No one will buy it and it'll disappear.

576
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,330
And that's if you've done 99.99% of 
things,

577
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,740
right.
So,

578
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,860
okay.
Creative writing or humor.

579
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,890
My humor has been recognized in a 
national publication that's the top yet.

580
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,160
And I've written a joke or cartoon that 
has been published.

581
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,490
I've written jokes for other people.
I've worked as a professional comedian.

582
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,503
Inventions.
I regularly find novel uses for 

583
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,890
household objects.
I've built a prototype of what it,

584
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,040
my designed inventions.
I've sold one of my inventions to people

585
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,874
I know.
Has anyone in here built a prototype of 

586
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:38,261
a design invention?
No one.

587
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,490
Okay.
Um Ha.

588
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,880
Is anyone in here created original 
software for a

589
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,140
one,
two,

590
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,720
three people?
Yes.

591
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,920
Three people.
How about um,

592
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,190
I've sketched out an invention and 
worked on its design flaws.

593
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,024
How many people?

594
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,780
So maybe two or three.
Yeah.

595
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:58,614
I mean if this was an engineering class 
and in all likelihood there would be 

596
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,690
more people in that category,
but that this is more in the domain.

597
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:07,020
It's not the exactly the artsy end of 
the creativity distribution.

598
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:10,200
It's more on the ideas and,
and mechanical end of it.

599
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,750
And that's a reasonable way of thinking 
about it.

600
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,160
I would say.
So.

601
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,070
Um,
scientific discovery,

602
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,830
I do not have training or recognized 
stability in this field.

603
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,040
I've received a scholarship based on my 
work in science or medicine.

604
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,903
How many people have received a 
scholarship based in their work on 

605
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,574
science and medicine?

606
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,330
Okay.
Nobody.

607
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,220
So we don't have anybody that goes up 
that high.

608
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,920
I have won a prize at a science fair or 
other local competition.

609
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,440
Anybody there?
Yes.

610
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,540
There's maybe two or three,
four people there.

611
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,870
So that means we've got four people in a
class of about 150.

612
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,220
Who hit the,
um,

613
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,313
third,
the second level of scientific 

614
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:49,250
discovery.
Anybody received a grant to pursue their

615
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,720
work in science and medicine?
It's hard.

616
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,583
Highly Unlikely.
You guys are mostly too young to have 

617
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,740
had that happened to you.
Okay.

618
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,350
So theater and film,
um,

619
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,663
anybody who's at,
how many people have performed in 

620
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,450
theater or film?
Oh yeah.

621
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:03,284
You're an artsy bud shea.
So my acting abilities have been 

622
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:08,720
recognized in local publication.
How many people for that one?

623
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,660
That's it.
Anybody higher than that?

624
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:15,860
I've directed or produced to theater or 
film production one too.

625
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,440
Um,
I've been paid.

626
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,410
There's a good one.
I have been paid to pay one to two.

627
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,490
Okay.
Um,

628
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,513
my theatrical work has,
I've been paid to direct a theater or 

629
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:29,540
film production.
Ha.

630
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,420
Got You there.
So you've done that.

631
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,910
Hey,
congratulations.

632
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,310
You're way the hell up on the list.
Right,

633
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,750
right,
right,

634
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,310
right.
Hard to monetize.

635
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,340
How many films did you make?
You made?

636
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:44,480
Four.
Did you make any money?

637
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,700
Oh,
you did?

638
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,930
Well,
congratulations.

639
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,740
Yeah,
yeah,

640
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,270
yeah.
Well that's a

641
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,900
Canadian filmmakers.
Yeah.

642
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,393
All of a sudden
queerness and then also piracy got 

643
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,410
really bad.
Right?

644
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,060
Yeah.
Well that's one of the big problems with

645
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:09,800
anything that can be distributed 
digitally.

646
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,450
It's like,
yeah,

647
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,713
yeah,
yeah.

648
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,340
Right.
Timing is everything and that's,

649
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,220
it's actually,
well that's,

650
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,083
that's another one of the terrible 
cutoffs is that not only do you have to 

651
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:25,160
be right and have yourself together and 
produce the proper thing,

652
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:25,994
but the market has to open its exactly 
that moment so that you could walk 

653
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:28,130
through.

654
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,963
There has to be a demand so people won't
buy anything that they don't have a 

655
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,160
crying need for it because they have 
priority.

656
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:34,994
Say it's magic.
Everybody has 10 priorities and tet 

657
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,990
number 10 is important,
but no one ever does it.

658
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,090
And number eight is important,
but no one ever does.

659
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,440
And so you have to go talk to someone to
buy what you have.

660
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,530
And that has to be priority one or two 
for them because they'll say,

661
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:48,790
oh that's good,
we really need it,

662
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,470
but it's priority eight.
It's like forget it.

663
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,423
They'll never buy your thing cause they 
never get to priority eight on their 

664
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,334
list of 10 priorities.
They want to get down to like priority 

665
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:56,704
for so.
And then the other thing that'll happen 

666
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:00,340
too is if you go up,
try to sell your product,

667
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,210
you won't know who to talk to it and 
you'll end up spending 95% of your time.

668
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,080
This is especially true in companies 
with the people who will talk to you,

669
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,640
right?
Obviously.

670
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,680
But those aren't the people who ever 
make any decisions.

671
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:12,514
So they'll tell you all sorts of good 
things about your product and how 

672
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,750
interested they are.
But they'll never buy because they can't

673
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:17,584
make it.
They make decisions and you won't be 

674
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,714
able to get to the people who make 
decisions because other people who know 

675
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:24,490
how to do that have already got there 
and that's not you.

676
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,060
So that's very difficult as well.
Culinary Arts,

677
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,430
my recipes have been published 
nationally.

678
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,380
Anyone?
How about,

679
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,600
um,
I often experiment with,

680
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,970
and this is purposeful experimentation,
right?

681
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:39,220
Not accidental experimentation.
Yeah.

682
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,640
Alright.
Alright.

683
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,900
My recipes have been published in local 
cookbook.

684
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,920
Anyone?
No.

685
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,611
Okay.
Okay.

686
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,240
Well,
you get the,

687
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,290
you get the point,
right?

688
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,700
You see,
you see how this works?

689
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:49,271
It's just,
well,

690
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,104
here are ways you can be creative and 
here are a strata of accomplishment 

691
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:53,890
within those ways.

692
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,140
And so then the question is what does it
look like?

693
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,030
Yes,
yes,

694
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,470
yes.
Fair enough.

695
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:02,900
And,
and,

696
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,190
and this probably needs to be updated to
reflect that.

697
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,020
So,
so there's,

698
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:10,780
there's the distribution of scores.
Now that's dismal.

699
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,540
That's a dismal thing to look out.
You have to understand that,

700
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,530
why look at this zero,
right?

701
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,723
The median person has not done anything 
creative ever in their life with 

702
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:24,190
anything on any dementia,
right?

703
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,024
It's really important to know that.
And then you have these horrible people 

704
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,680
out here,
right?

705
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,930
They do everything.
They do everything.

706
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,120
Price's law.
Here's price's law.

707
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,160
This is something to hammer into your 
heart.

708
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,000
The square root of the number of people 
in a domain do 50% of the work.

709
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,861
Okay?
So let's,

710
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:43,750
let's go through that.
You have 10 employees,

711
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,210
three of them do.
Half the work makes sense.

712
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,220
That's reasonable.
You have a hundred employees,

713
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
10 of them do half the work.

714
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,963
That's problem.
So the other 90% are doing the other 

715
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,050
half.
Who cares about them?

716
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:59,530
You have 10,000 employees,
a hundred of them do half the work,

717
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,031
right?
So here's a,

718
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,470
here's a nasty little law.
As your company grows in,

719
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,490
competence grows into exponentially and 
competence grows linearly.

720
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,290
Got It.
Right?

721
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,900
Because it with 10 it's three who are 
doing half the work,

722
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:16,150
but at 10,000 it's a hundred that are 
doing half the work.

723
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:16,984
So 9,900 of your employees are doing as 
much as the best 100 you might not even 

724
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:22,744
know who the best 100 are,
but probably they know and maybe their 

725
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,984
peers know too.
And so one of the things that's really 

726
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,890
interesting when big companies start to 
shake,

727
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,660
which means maybe they've had a bad 
quarter,

728
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:34,600
two bad quarters and the stock price 
starts to tip down.

729
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,190
And the people,
the heart,

730
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,740
people who have options are not very 
happy about that.

731
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,660
And maybe they start to announce 
layoffs.

732
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,790
The hundred people who have 
opportunities leave and they're the ones

733
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:44,624
who were doing half the work.
So boy that puts your company in a 

734
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,354
pretty rough situation because now 
you've got the 19 900 people left over 

735
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,930
who were only doing half the work and 
the next time you announce layoffs,

736
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,793
the next most productive hundred leave.
And so then you're left with nobody 

737
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:03,050
who's productive at a massive overhead 
payroll price's law.

738
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,180
You can look that up.
Desal,

739
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,103
a price to solar price is a guy who was 
looking at scientific productivity and 

740
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,344
one of the things he found was when he 
was looking at Phd students is that the 

741
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:17,060
median number of publications for a phd 
graduate when he did his work,

742
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,450
which was in the early sixties was one,
okay,

743
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,403
half as many had two half as many as 
that had three half as many as that had 

744
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:25,370
four.

745
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,203
It's a real step down and one of the 
corollaries of that is that there's a 

746
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:29,444
certain number of people who are hyper 
productive and that's these people out 

747
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:32,804
here.
And if you were graphing the 

748
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,800
distribution,
let's say you graft,

749
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,420
how many people in that population of 
300 had $10,000 in a savings account?

750
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,533
It would look very much like this.
Some of them would have are some of 

751
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:46,820
them.
Some of them would.

752
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,310
Most people would have like no savings 
whatsoever.

753
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,980
The median person would have no savings 
whatsoever.

754
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:54,980
And then you go up here where the 1% is,
they have all the money.

755
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,090
But the thing you want to understand 
about that 1% issue that you always hear

756
00:33:59,091 --> 00:33:59,924
about is that it applies in every single
realm where there's difference in 

757
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,570
creative production.
Every realm,

758
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,910
it doesn't matter.
Number of records produced,

759
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,220
number of records sold,
number of compositions written.

760
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,180
So here,
here's a,

761
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,013
here's an example,
five composers produce the music that 

762
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:19,040
occupies 50% of the classical rep 
repertoire,

763
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,001
right?
Bach,

764
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:21,290
Beethoven,
Brahms,

765
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,810
Tchaikovsky,
Mozart.

766
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,860
That's right.
Those five.

767
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,270
Okay,
so here's something cool.

768
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,410
So you take all the music,
those people wrote 5% of the music.

769
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:31,244
All those people wrote occupies 50% of 
the music that of their writing that's 

770
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,090
played.
So not only do,

771
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,710
almost all the composers never get 
Alyson,

772
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,040
but even among the composers who do get 
less,

773
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,140
almost none of their music ever gets 
played.

774
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,460
So,
so then that's a,

775
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,850
that's another example of this price's 
law scaling.

776
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,980
So when it applies to all sorts of 
things,

777
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,040
like number of hockey goal scored is 
also distributed this way.

778
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Number of basketball basketball backs 
basketballs successfully put through the

779
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,210
hoop,
follows the same distribution.

780
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,413
Uh,
size of cities follows the same 

781
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,260
distribution.
It's a weird,

782
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,340
it's a weird law.

783
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,530
And you,
you can think about it in part a,

784
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,790
why does this happen?
While imagine what happens when you play

785
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,160
monopoly.
What happens?

786
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,200
Everybody has the same amount of money 
to begin with,

787
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,840
right?
So then you start playing,

788
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:21,674
it's basically a random game while some 
people start to win a bit and some 

789
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,360
people start to lose a bit.
And then if you win,

790
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,360
the high probability that you'll keep 
winning starts to increase.

791
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,870
And if you lose your vulnerability 
increases as you lose.

792
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,330
And then maybe you've got say six people
playing monopoly,

793
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,010
soon.
One person has zero.

794
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,920
What happens when they have zero?
They're out of the game.

795
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,590
So zero's a weird number because when 
you hit zero,

796
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,780
you're out of the game.
So,

797
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,900
so then if you keep playing,
people start to stack up at zero,

798
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,000
right?
What happens at the end of the game?

799
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,740
One person has all the property and all 
the money and everyone else has none,

800
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,933
right?
That's what happens if you play an 

801
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,750
iterated trading game to its final 
conclusion,

802
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,033
and that's part of the law in a sense 
that's underlying this kind of 

803
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:06,150
distribution.
So it's a,

804
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:07,410
it's a really,
it's,

805
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,273
it's,
it's not a consequence necessarily of 

806
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:10,704
structural inequality.
It's built into the system at a deeper 

807
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,240
level than that.
So we get know people talk about all the

808
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,590
time about how unfair it is that the 1% 
of the population has the vast amount of

809
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,710
the money and 1% of the 1% has most of 
that money.

810
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,220
And 1% of the 1% of the 1% has most of 
that money.

811
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,290
But it is a,
it's a,

812
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,280
it's an inevitable conclusion of 
iterated trading games and we don't know

813
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,114
how to fight it.
We don't know how to take from the 

814
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:36,504
people who have and move it to the 
bottom without an instantly moving back 

815
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:40,224
up to the top.

816
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Different people maybe,
but still back up to the top.

817
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,630
Cause even the 1% churns a lot.
Like I think you have a 10% chance,

818
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:49,464
if I remember correctly,
you have a 10% chance of being in the 

819
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,374
top 1% for at least one year of your 
life and a 40% chance of being in the 

820
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:59,430
top 10% for at least one year in your 
life.

821
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,950
That's in Canada and the US,
it's less so in Europe,

822
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,800
so there's a fair bit of churning at the
top end.

823
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,290
It's not the same people all the time 
who have the money,

824
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,980
but it is a tiny fraction of the people 
all the time who have all the money.

825
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,300
Yeah.
Some people

826
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,423
do.
The people inside redistribute to 

827
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:24,380
recreate the scene?
No,

828
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,890
unusually.
I mean they do,

829
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:30,670
but it's attenuated because the people,
I mean

830
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,090
few reshuffled the entire company and 
put everywhere somewhere else.

831
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:35,924
There's some probability that some of 
those people would rise to the top that 

832
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:40,520
weren't at the top before,
but in that company,

833
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,180
that isn't generally what happens.
People get stuck in their niche and they

834
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,880
don't move.
So yeah,

835
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,740
this is cool.
You wonder sometimes,

836
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:50,480
well,
how can companies die so quickly?

837
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,321
Well,
they go,

838
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:52,154
they go into a death spiral that's 
almost impossible for them to get out 

839
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,470
of.
So,

840
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,500
and it happened.
It can happen extraordinarily quickly.

841
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,510
This is why,
you know,

842
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,310
the typical fortune 500 company only 
lasts 30 years.

843
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,233
That's it.
It's not that easy for these Bay Ammas 

844
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,830
to continue existence across time.
So,

845
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,020
and it's because it's really easy for 
something to die.

846
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,150
It's very unlikely that it will be 
built.

847
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,960
It's very unlikely that it will be 
successful and one successful.

848
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:15,794
It's very unlikely that it will continue
to duplicate it success because the 

849
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:21,770
underlying landscape shifts on it and it
doesn't know where to go.

850
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,083
And that's also partly because it's not 
that easy to integrate creative people 

851
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,130
into your company.
Right?

852
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,203
You certainly don't want them at the 
bottom because they're supposed to be 

853
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,570
people who are doing what they're told 
to do.

854
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,703
So you filter out a lot of them at the 
bottom and then you need them at the 

855
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:37,630
top.
But they've already been filtered out.

856
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:41,530
And also creative people are troublesome
to work with because they're always,

857
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,830
how do you evaluate a creative person?
You won't,

858
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,693
you almost can't by definition,
because they keep coming up with new 

859
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,910
things and you don't have a good 
evaluative strategy for a new thing.

860
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,030
It wouldn't be new if you had a good 
evaluative strategy for it,

861
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:55,864
right?
It would have to be the member of a 

862
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,900
class that you've already encountered 
substantially.

863
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,123
So anyway,
so the take home lesson from this is 

864
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,950
zero,
right?

865
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,600
Right.
And then that's like,

866
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,750
that's like a graph of of money,
monetary distribution as well.

867
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,763
And the thing,
the problem with being at zero is very 

868
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:13,894
difficult to get out of zero.
This is also why people get stuck in 

869
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:17,410
poverty.
You know,

870
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,350
you can't get a bank account if you're,
if you don't have any money,

871
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,213
right?
There's a bunch of things that start to 

872
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:26,380
move against you when you're at zero 
that you can't shake.

873
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,453
It's very difficult to get out of the,
to get out of the pit here because zero 

874
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:33,070
is a kind of pit.

875
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,273
Okay.
So now we've got the creative 

876
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,693
achievement questionnaire and we're 
going to take your score and your score 

877
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,124
has a summed across all the categories 
and all the exemplars of the categories 

878
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:47,950
that you've chosen.
So then the question is,

879
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,350
well,
can you predict creative achievement?

880
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:52,750
And and this is,
this is,

881
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,300
this is how we did it.
This was construct validation.

882
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:56,134
The first thing we wanted to know was,
well it was the creative achievement 

883
00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:59,044
questionnaire actually associated with 
something that you might regard his 

884
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,350
creativity.
Okay.

885
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,080
So we,
we got uh,

886
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,190
a number of,
of,

887
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,113
of,
of students to come in and we gave them 

888
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,154
a collage kit.
And so then everybody got exactly the 

889
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:14,800
same Kipp and then we had to make a 
collage out of the collage kit.

890
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,190
And then we have five artists rate the 
collage for quality.

891
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,410
And then we averaged across the ratings.

892
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,243
Now,
the first thing you would do if you did 

893
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,620
that is cause he would might think,
well,

894
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,573
can artists actually come up with an a 
measure of how creative a collages and 

895
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:31,690
the answer to that is actually 
technical.

896
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,303
If all say you guys are the panel,
if all of you identified the same 

897
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:39,970
collages as of high quality and the same
ones as of low quality,

898
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,013
then we can assume that there's 
something about your judgment that's 

899
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,420
like independent of your idiosyncrasies.
We could say,

900
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:50,320
well there is a judgment that emerges as
a consensus across artists.

901
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:52,530
And the first thing we found was that 
there was,

902
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,573
there was,
there was quite a high correlation 

903
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:59,431
between each artists judgement of the 
quality of the collages.

904
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,690
I can't remember what the interrater 
reliability was,

905
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:04,120
but it was something like 0.8 it was 
really high.

906
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,283
So it was clear that trained artists 
could make reliable judgments about the 

907
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:09,214
quality of collages because you had to 
check that out first because if they're 

908
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,960
all over the place,
you've got no measure.

909
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,943
Right?
It's like everyone's using a different 

910
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:16,564
rulers got no measure,
so they have to be using the same 

911
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,564
router.
While we found that the correlation 

912
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,874
between the creative evaluation of 
collages and the total caq was 0.59 

913
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,094
which is mind boggling.
I told you last time that under 5% of 

914
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,980
published social studies,
social science studies have,

915
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,410
are,
are uh,

916
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,940
demonstrate at a correlation coefficient
of an effect size greater than 0.5.

917
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,570
This is 0.6 and if you,
if you square it,

918
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,433
0.5 squared is 25% of the variance 0.6 
squared is 36% of the variance 0.6 is a 

919
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:50,564
lot more than 0.5 and 0.5 is unheard of.
And so the fact that you could estimate 

920
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:56,414
someone's lifetime creative achievement 
by having them do a collage that for 

921
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,170
artists,
uh,

922
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,850
rate was an indication that there really
is something real at the bottom of it,

923
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:05,684
right?
Because that's like the definition of 

924
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:09,350
real,
the creative personality scale.

925
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,353
You,
you circle adjectives that are 

926
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:12,704
associated with creativity from a very 
large list of adjectives that work 

927
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,420
pretty well.
Goldberg's adjective markers.

928
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:20,930
That's another big five variant that was
correlated at about 0.5.

929
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:23,270
One it doesn't measure openness to 
experience,

930
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,770
it just measures intellect.
Um,

931
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,080
but be that as it mate,
it's still an personality marker of,

932
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,400
of,
of trade openness.

933
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,323
It was correlated at 0.5.
One the neo pir openness was correlated 

934
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,764
at 0.3,
three and then we use the divergent 

935
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:40,670
thinking tests and I told you about 
those already's.

936
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,640
How many uses can you think of for a 
brick for example.

937
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,220
And so those are scored according to 
fluency,

938
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:48,770
how many answers you provide.
And then also originality,

939
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:51,290
how many unique useful answers do you 
provide.

940
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,363
And that was nicely correlated as well.
Overall correlation of 0.47 and then 

941
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,880
fluency 0.38,
originality 0.4,

942
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:01,100
six and flexibility 0.37.

943
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,140
So,
so what does that mean?

944
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,003
Well,
the creative achievement questionnaire 

945
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,853
indexes lifetime creative achievement in
a way that's powerfully associated with 

946
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:11,204
actual creative production of a single 
item plus creative create creativity as 

947
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:18,090
it's indexed by personality markers.
Um,

948
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,600
the Caq is also potently predicted by 
Iq,

949
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,980
which is exactly what you'd expect.
So you can do at an extraordinarily good

950
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:25,814
job of determining how likely someone is
to have high levels of creative 

951
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,880
achievement across their life span by 
using psychometric tests.

952
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,070
So it means that creativity is a real 
thing.

953
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:37,960
That's the first thing,
both in terms of thinking creatively and

954
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,833
that would be the divergent thinking 
tests and also in terms of creative 

955
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:42,104
production and the and that creative 
production and creative thinking are 

956
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,730
quite tightly aligned.
So,

957
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,250
so that was good.
That's been a very influential paper.

958
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,710
I think it's got about 500 citations.
Now.

959
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,543
People use the creative achievement 
questionnaire a lot to assess 

960
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:55,184
creativity.
It's also associated with a higher than 

961
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:57,974
average likelihood of psychosis.
And the other thing you see with 

962
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:02,720
creative people is that they tend to,
especially if they're writers,

963
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,554
they tend the pathology that goes along 
with that is often manic depressive 

964
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:07,964
disorder.
And that's partly because manic people 

965
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,540
become unbelievably fluid,
right?

966
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,610
They can,
they speak incredibly quickly.

967
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:14,444
They generate ideas like mad and it's a 
hyper arousal of the positive emotions 

968
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:19,940
system,
roughly speaking.

969
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,280
And that can have as a side effect 
creativity.

970
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,350
So
this is a cool study.

971
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:31,590
I just found this one today.
It's a terror management study,

972
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,880
so what?
Well,

973
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:33,714
I'll read it to you.
The relationship between creativity and 

974
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,460
symbolic immortality had been long 
acknowledged by scholars.

975
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:39,983
In your review of the literature,
we found 12 papers that empirically 

976
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:46,500
examined the relationship between 
creativity and mortality awareness using

977
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,334
it terror management theory paradigm 
overall supporting the notion that 

978
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:54,000
creativity plays an important role in 
the management of existential concerns.

979
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,433
Also,
a mini metro analysis of the impact of 

980
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,670
death awareness on creativity resulted 
in a small,

981
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:00,504
medium weighted mean effect.
We examine the existential buffering 

982
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,074
functions of creative achievement as 
assessed by the creative achievement 

983
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:11,520
questionnaire in a sample of 108 
students at a high but not low levels of

984
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,730
creative goals.
Creative achievement was associated with

985
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:18,780
lower death thought accessibility under 
mortality salients.

986
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:19,614
Well,
that means if you remind people that 

987
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:21,804
they're going to die,
the creative people were less likely to 

988
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:27,840
generate death related thoughts as a 
consequence to our knowledge,

989
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,674
this is the first empirical report of 
the anxiety buffering functions of a 

990
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:32,364
creative achievement among people for 
whom creativity constitutes a central 

991
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:35,724
part of their cultural worldview.
It's like a empirical examination of 

992
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:42,150
some of the existential theories that I 
was presenting to previously.

993
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,043
Because part of the idea that was put 
forth to say by people like nature was 

994
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:46,914
that one of the ways to fight back 
against existential anxiety and death 

995
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:53,370
anxiety and all of that is to engage in 
creative production.

996
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,040
And so that was actually put the 
empirical test in this study.

997
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,460
So I thought that was quite cool.
So here's another paper.

998
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,410
This was by Kauffman and a couple of my 
students,

999
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,200
Jacob Hersch and Colin Young,
I'm on that paper as well,

1000
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:14,760
near the end there.
Um,

1001
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,743
they were interested in whether openness
and intellect predicted different 

1002
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,040
elements of creative achievement.
Sort of goes back to your question about

1003
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,933
the differentiation between the artsy 
and of creativity and maybe the more 

1004
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,350
practical it and,
and,

1005
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,243
uh,
uh,

1006
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,370
the practical land associated,
for example,

1007
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:34,140
with a proclivity,
but like nonfiction,

1008
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,300
the big five personality,
dimension,

1009
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,280
openness slash,
intellect

1010
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,693
is the trait most closely associated 
with creativity and creative 

1011
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,620
achievement.
Little is known.

1012
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,493
However,
regarding the discriminant validity of 

1013
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:48,014
it's two aspects.
Discriminant validity is whether one 

1014
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,303
aspect predicts one set of things and 
the other aspect predicts a different 

1015
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,260
set of things.
If there's no discriminant validity,

1016
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,450
if they can't be used for different 
purposes,

1017
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,930
then there's no point having them.
So you want to see that they're actually

1018
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:07,010
capable of differentiating between 
between real world phenomena,

1019
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,180
two of its aspects,
openness to experience.

1020
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,180
Okay.

1021
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,700
Reflecting cognitive engagement with 
perception,

1022
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:19,300
fantasy aesthetics and emotions and 
intellect,

1023
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,313
reflecting cognitive engagement with 
abstract and semantic information 

1024
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,980
primarily through reasoning in relation 
to creativity.

1025
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,090
In four demographically diverse totaling
over a thousand participants,

1026
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,283
we investigated the independent 
predictive validity of openness and 

1027
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:37,510
intellect by assessing the relations 
among cognitive ability,

1028
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:38,344
divergent thinking,
personality and creative achievement 

1029
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,013
across the arts and sciences.
We confirmed that hypothesis that 

1030
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:47,390
openness predicts creative achievement 
in the arts

1031
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,950
and intellect predicts creative 
achievement in the sciences,

1032
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,070
inclusion of performance,
measures of general cognitive ability.

1033
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,083
That's Iq and divergent thinking 
indicated that the relationship of 

1034
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:03,090
intellect to scientific creativity may 
be due,

1035
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:05,580
at least in part to these abilities.
Lastly,

1036
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,414
we found that extroversion additionally 
predicted creative achievement in the 

1037
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,624
arts independently of openness.
So what that means is that creative 

1038
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:14,244
achievement in the arts is actually a 
function of the higher order trait 

1039
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,900
plasticity,
right?

1040
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,600
Cause plasticity was openness plus 
extroversion,

1041
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,703
and that's associated fundamentally with
activation of the underlying 

1042
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:26,274
dopaminergic system,
which is the system that mediates 

1043
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:31,410
exploratory behavior.
So if you're dominated by that,

1044
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,990
the function of that system,
you're an exploratory,

1045
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:34,824
gregarious person,
then you're more likely to manifest 

1046
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,020
creative ability in the arts.
So

1047
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,673
apparently

1048
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,573
it's time to stop.
I think that's the same student who 

1049
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:48,210
always does that,
isn't it?

1050
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,360
All right,
we'll see you on Tuesday.
