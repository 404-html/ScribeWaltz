1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:02,640
No,

2
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,140
well thank you all very much for coming.
It's really shocking to me that you 

3
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:36,870
don't have anything better to do on a 
Tuesday.

4
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,820
No,
seriously though.

5
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,170
It is.
I mean,

6
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:41,920
you know,
it's,

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
it's very strange in some sense that 
there's so many of you here to listen to

8
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:52,801
a sequence of psych,
of lectures on the psychological 

9
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:53,620
significance of the biblical stories.
It isn't something I've wanted to do for

10
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:58,621
a long time,
but it still does surprise me that 

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,700
there's a ready audience for it and.
Well,

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,180
so that's good.
So we'll see how it goes.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,390
And uh,
I'll start with this because this is the

14
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:15,391
right question.
The right question is why bother doing 

15
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,151
this?
And I don't mean why should I bother 

16
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,580
doing it?
I have my own reasons for doing it,

17
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:20,170
but you might think,
well,

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,800
why bother with this stranger will book 
at all.

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,610
And that's a good question.
You know,

20
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,170
um,
it's a contradictory

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,290
document that's been cobbled together 
over thousands of years.

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,540
It's outlasted kingdom,
this many,

23
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,650
many kingdoms.
You know,

24
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,770
it's,
it's really interesting that it turns 

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,020
out that a book is more durable than the
stone.

26
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,110
It's more durable than a castle.
It's more durable than an empire,

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
and that's really interesting.
You know that.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,010
It's something in some sense,
so evanescent can be so long living,

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,630
so there's that.
That's kind of a mystery.

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,530
I'm,
I'm approaching this whole scenario.

31
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:11,531
This is the biblical stories as if 
they're a mystery fundamentally because 

32
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,271
they are.
There's a lot we don't understand about 

33
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:16,610
them.
We don't understand how they came about.

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,850
We don't really understand how they were
put together.

35
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,310
We don't understand why they had such an
unbelievable impact on civilization.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,370
We don't understand how people could 
have believed them.

37
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,910
We don't understand what it means that 
we don't believe them now or or even 

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,690
what it would mean if we didn't believe 
them there.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,760
There's and then on top of all that 
there's the additional problem,

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which isn't specific to me but is 
certainly relevant to me that no matter 

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,231
how educated you are,
you're not educated enough to discuss 

42
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,610
the psychological significance of the 
biblical stories,

43
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,180
but I'm going to do my best and partly 
because I want to learn more about and 

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,040
one of

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
the things I've learned is that the best
way to learn about something is to talk 

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,290
about it and when I'm lecturing I'm 
thinking,

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,320
you know,
I'm not trying to tell you what I know 

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,540
for sure to be the case because there's 
lots of things I don't know for sure to 

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,680
be the case.
I'm trying to make sense out of this and

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,720
I have been doing this for a long time 
now.

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,950
Know you may know you may.
Not that I'm an admirer of Nisha.

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,290
Nisha was a devastating critic of,
I would say dogmatic Christianity.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,130
Christianity as it was instantiated in 
institutions,

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,670
I suppose.
Although he.

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,900
He's a very paradoxical thinker because,
for example,

56
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,901
one of the things you said was that he 
didn't believe that the scientific 

57
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:50,670
revolution would have ever got off the 
ground if it hadn't been for 

58
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,450
Christianity and more specifically for 
Catholicism because he believed that 

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,390
over the course of really a thousand 
years,

60
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,200
the European mind,
so to speak,

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,130
had to train itself to interpret 
everything that was known within a 

62
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,580
single coherent framework,
coherent.

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,050
If you accept the initial axioms,
a single coherent framework and so neat,

64
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,760
you believe that that catholicized of,
of,

65
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,190
of the phenomena of life and of history 
produced the kind of mind that was then 

66
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:31,561
capable of transcending that it's 
dogmatic foundations and then 

67
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:36,181
concentrating on something else,
which in this particular case happened 

68
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:38,230
to be the natural world and so need you 
to believe that in some sense,

69
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:43,231
Christianity died at its own hand.
It had spent a very long period of time 

70
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:46,750
trying to attune people to the necessity
of the truth.

71
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,990
You know,
absent the corruption and all of that,

72
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,180
that's always part of any human 
endeavor.

73
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,690
And then the truth,
the spirit of the truth that was 

74
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,271
developed by Christianity turned on the 
roots of Christianity and everyone woke 

75
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,170
up and said something like,
or thought something like,

76
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,150
well,
how is it that we came to believe any of

77
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,570
this?

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,290
Um,
it's like waking up one day and noting,

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,840
noting that you really don't know why 
you put a Christmas tree up,

80
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,990
but you've been doing it for a long time
and that's what people do.

81
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,440
And I know there are reasons that 
Christmas trees came about,

82
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:20,650
but the,
what would you say?

83
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:24,580
That ritual lasts long after the reasons
have been forgotten.

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
So now Nicha,
although he was a critic of Christianity

85
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:35,980
and also a champion of,
of its disciplinary capacity,

86
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,981
because you see,
the other thing that needs you to 

87
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:41,080
believe was that it was not possible to 
be free in some sense,

88
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:44,350
unless you,
unless you had been a slave.

89
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,730
And by that he meant that you don't go 
from childhood to full fledged adult 

90
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:55,321
individuality.
You go from childhood to estate of 

91
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,490
discipline,
which you might think is akin to 

92
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,260
slavery,
to self imposed slavery.

93
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,850
That that would be the best scenario 
where you have to discipline yourself to

94
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,851
become something specific before you 
might be able to retain the generality 

95
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,930
that you had as a child.

96
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,590
And he believed that Christianity had 
played that role for Western 

97
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,810
civilization.
I'm,

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,160
but in the late 18 hundreds,
he announced that God was dead and you 

99
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:29,450
often hear of that as something 
triumphant,

100
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,470
but for her it wasn't because he was too
nuanced.

101
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,471
The thinker to be that simple minded.
See Nicha understood that this is 

102
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:44,021
something I'm going to try to make clear
is that we,

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,320
there's,
there's a very large amount that we 

104
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,961
don't know about the structure of 
experience that we don't know about 

105
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,970
reality and we have our articulated 
representations of the world.

106
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,980
And then you can think of outside of 
that,

107
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,981
there are things we know absolutely 
nothing about and there's a buffer 

108
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:06,011
between them.
And those are things we sort of know 

109
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:06,830
something about and we don't know them 
in an articulated way.

110
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,060
Here's an example.
You know,

111
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,770
sometimes you're arguing with one of 
your,

112
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,780
someone close to you and they're in a 
bad mood,

113
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,550
you know,
and uh,

114
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
they're being touchy and unreasonable 
and it keep the conversation up and 

115
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,970
maybe all of a sudden they,
you know,

116
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,971
they get angry or maybe they cry and 
then when they cry they figure out what 

117
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:25,220
they're angry about and it has nothing 
to do with you.

118
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,310
Even though you might have been what 
precipitated the argument,

119
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,330
you know,
that's an interesting phenomena as far 

120
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,621
as I'm concerned because it means that 
people can know things at one level 

121
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,220
without being able to speak what they 
know at another and so in,

122
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:43,221
in some sense,
the thoughts rise up from the body and 

123
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,210
they,
they do that in moods and they do that 

124
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,210
in the images and they do that in 
actions.

125
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,171
And we have all sorts of ways that we 
understand before we understand in a 

126
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:54,941
fully articulated manner.
And so we have this articulated space 

127
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,381
that we can all discuss.
And then outside of that we have 

128
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,240
something that's more akin to a dream 
that we're embedded in.

129
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:04,340
And it's an emotional dream that we're 
embedded in and that's based at least in

130
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,530
part on her actions.
I'll describe that later.

131
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,680
And then outside of that is what we 
don't know anything about at all.

132
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,460
And in that dream,
that's where the mystics live and that's

133
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:18,461
where the artists live and there are the
mediators between the absolute unknown 

134
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:22,931
and the things we know for sure.
And you see what that means in some 

135
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:29,171
sense is what we know is established on 
a form of knowledge that we don't really

136
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:34,631
understand.
And that if those two things are out of 

137
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:37,091
sync.
So you might say if our articulated 

138
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,311
knowledge is out of sync with our dream,
than we've become dissociated 

139
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:44,261
internally.
We think things we don't act out and we 

140
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:47,650
act out things we don't dream.
And that produces a kind of sickness of 

141
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,551
the spirit and,
and that sickness of the spirit it see 

142
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:56,040
it.
It's cure or is something like an system

143
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:01,041
of belief and representation.
And then people turn to things like 

144
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,941
ideologies,
which I regard as parasites on an 

145
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,030
underlying religious substructure to try
to organize their thinking.

146
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,930
And then that's a catastrophe.
And that's what Nisha Nisha foresaw,

147
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,960
you see,
he knew that when we knocked the slats 

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,920
out of the base of Western civilization 
by destroying this representation,

149
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,320
this is God ideal,
let's say,

150
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,480
that we would destabilize and move back 
and forth violently between nihilism,

151
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,481
let's say in the extremes of videology.
He was particularly concerned about 

152
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,540
radical leftist ideology.
You know,

153
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,660
unbelieved in predicted this in the late
18 hundreds,

154
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:35,970
which is really an absolute intellectual
tour.

155
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:40,971
De Force of staggering magnitude 
predicted that in the 20th century that 

156
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,991
hundreds of millions of people would die
because of the replacement of these 

157
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:48,120
underlying dreamlike structures with 
this rational,

158
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,410
rational but deeply incorrect 
representation of the world.

159
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:57,411
And you know,
we'd been oscillating back and forth 

160
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:57,570
between left and right in some sense 
ever since.

161
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,330
And you know,
with some good sprinkling of nihilism in

162
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:05,331
there and despair in some sense,
that's the situation of the modern 

163
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:09,090
western person and in an increasingly 
have people in general.

164
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,630
You know,
I think part of the reason that Islam 

165
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,030
has its backup with regards to the west 
to such a degree.

166
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,860
I mean,
there's many reasons and not all of them

167
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,030
are valid,
that's for sure.

168
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,420
But one of the reasons is that,
you know,

169
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,800
they,
they being still grounded in a,

170
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,000
in a,
in a dream,

171
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:29,001
let's say,
they can see that the root less 

172
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,360
questioning mind of the west pope poses 
a tremendous danger to the integrity of 

173
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,900
their culture now.
And it does,

174
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,120
I mean Westerners,
us,

175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,660
we undermine ourselves all the time with
our searching intellect.

176
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,240
And I'm not complaining about that at,
you know what I mean?

177
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,250
It,
it,

178
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,760
there isn't anything easy that can be 
done about it,

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,940
but,
but it's still,

180
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,300
it's still sort of what fruitful 
catastrophe and you know,

181
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,480
it has real effects on people's lives.
It's not some abstract thing,

182
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:57,710
you know?

183
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,740
I mean,
lots of times when I've been treating 

184
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:02,740
people for depression,
for example,

185
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,830
or anxiety,
they have existential issues.

186
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,831
You know,
it's not just some psychiatric 

187
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:09,831
condition.
It's not just that they're tapped off of

188
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,850
normal because their brain chemistry is 
faulty.

189
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,050
Although,
you know,

190
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:18,051
sometimes that happens to be the case.
It's that they are overwhelmed by the 

191
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:22,350
suffering and complexity of their life 
and they're not sure why it's reasonable

192
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,700
to continue with it.
You know,

193
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,510
that they can feel that terrible 
negative meanings of life,

194
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,440
but are skeptical beyond belief about 
any of the positive meanings.

195
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,441
I had one client who was a very 
brilliant artist and as long as he 

196
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:36,900
didn't think he was fine,
you know,

197
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:40,380
because he'd go and create and who is 
really good at being an artist.

198
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,070
He just,
you know,

199
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:46,071
he had that personality that was 
continually creative and quite 

200
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:46,071
brilliant.

201
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,500
Although he was self denigrating and.
But as soon as he started to think about

202
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,910
what he was doing,
then you know,

203
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,990
the,
the,

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,110
it's like a,
like a drill or a saw or something like 

205
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,831
that.
He'd saw the branch off that he was 

206
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:01,960
sitting on because it starts to 
criticize what he was doing.

207
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,110
Even the utility of it,
even though it was sort of self 

208
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,110
evidently useful and then he would be 
that.

209
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,841
It would be very,
very hard for him to even motivate 

210
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:11,841
himself to create an he,
I,

211
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,420
he always struck me as a good example 
of,

212
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,320
of the consequences of having your 
rational intellect divorced in some way 

213
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:26,701
from your being divorced enough so that 
it actually questioned the utility of 

214
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,750
your being.
And it's not a good thing.

215
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,590
It's not a good thing and it's,
it's,

216
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,900
it's really not a good thing because it 
manifests itself not only an individual 

217
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,490
psychopathology but also in social 
psychopathology.

218
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,670
And that's his proclivity of people to 
get tangled up in ideologies,

219
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,640
which,
which I really do think of as,

220
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,130
as they're like,
they're like crippled religions.

221
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,480
That's the right way to think about 
them.

222
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,910
They're like a religion that's missing 
an arm and a leg,

223
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:55,660
but can still haul bill along and it,
it provides a certain amount of security

224
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,880
and group identity,
but it's,

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
it's warped and twisted and demented and
banter and it's a parasite on something 

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,650
underlying that's rich and true.
And that's how it looks to me anyways.

227
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,300
And,
and so.

228
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,590
So I think it's very important that we 
sort out this problem.

229
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,360
Um,
I think that,

230
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,260
I think that there isn't anything more 
important that needs to be done than 

231
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,690
that I've,
I've thought that for a long,

232
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,720
long time,
probably since the early eighties when I

233
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:29,731
started looking at the site,
the role that belief systems played in 

234
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:31,720
regulating psychological and social 
health,

235
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,510
um,
because they,

236
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,330
you can tell that they do that because 
of how upset people get.

237
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,310
If you challenge their belief systems.
It's like,

238
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:42,430
why the hell do they care?
Exactly what difference does it make if,

239
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,230
if all of your ideological axioms are 
100 percent correct?

240
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,870
Like people get unbelievably upset when 
you,

241
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,570
when you poke them in the axioms,
so to speak.

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,960
And it isn't,
it is not by any stretch of the 

243
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,510
imagination obvious why,
you know,

244
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,780
but there's some,
it's like there's a fundamental truth 

245
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,780
that they're standing on.
It's,

246
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,041
it's,
it's like they're on a raft in the 

247
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:08,041
middle of the ocean and you're starting 
to pull out the logs,

248
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,250
you know,
and they're afraid they're gonna fall in

249
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,080
and drown.
It's like drowning.

250
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,930
What and what are the logs protecting 
themselves,

251
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,090
protecting them from and why are they so
afraid to to move beyond the confines of

252
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,960
the ideological system and like these 
are not obvious things,

253
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,590
so I've been trying to puzzle that out 
for a very long time and I've done some 

254
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,760
lectures about that that are on youtube.

255
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,210
Most of you know that some of what I'm 
going to talk about in this series,

256
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,090
you'll have heard if you've listened to 
the youtube videos,

257
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,950
but you know I'm trying to hit it from 
different angles and so okay,

258
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,770
so niches.
Idea was that human beings,

259
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:47,740
we're going to have to create their own 
values essentially.

260
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,710
Now he understood that we have bodies 
and that we had motivations and emotions

261
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:56,711
like he was a romantic thinker in some 
sense but way ahead of his time because 

262
00:14:56,711 --> 00:15:00,050
he knew that our capacity to think 
wasn't some free floating soul,

263
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:04,730
but was embedded in our physiology,
constrained by our emotions,

264
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,890
shaped by our motivation,
shaped by our body.

265
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:11,891
He understood that,
but he still believed that the only 

266
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,480
possible way out of the problem would be
for human beings themselves.

267
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:19,481
To become something akin to God and to 
create their own values that was steps 

268
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,830
and he thought that the person,
he.

269
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,970
He talked about the person who could 
create their own values as the overman 

270
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,790
or the superman and that was one of the 
parts of the Nietzschean philosophy that

271
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,840
the Nazis,
I would say took out of context and used

272
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:36,841
to fuel their superior man ideology.
So we know what happened with that.

273
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:41,810
That didn't seem to turn out very well.
That's for sure.

274
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,340
And See.
I also spent a lot of time reading Carl 

275
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,710
young and it was through you and also 
John,

276
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,780
Piaget's developmental psychologists 
that I started to understand that are 

277
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,980
articulated systems of thought are 
embedded in something like a dream.

278
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,690
That dream is informed in a complex way 
by the way we act.

279
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,930
So you know,
we act out things we don't understand 

280
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,401
all the time and if that wasn't the case
then we wouldn't need a psychology or 

281
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:15,671
sociology or in anthropology or any of 
that because we would be completely 

282
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:15,671
transparent to ourselves.

283
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:20,560
And we're clearly not.
So we're much more complicated than we 

284
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,521
understand.
Which means that the way that we behave 

285
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,041
contains way more information than we 
know and part of the dream that 

286
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:32,501
surrounds our articulated knowledge has 
been extracted as a consequence of us 

287
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:37,061
watching each other and behave and 
telling stories about it for thousands 

288
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:40,700
and thousands and thousands of years.
Extracting out patterns of behavior that

289
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:45,701
characterize humanity and trying to 
represent them partly through 

290
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,530
invitation,
but also through drama and mythology and

291
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,830
literature and art and all of that to 
represent what we're like so that we can

292
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:56,831
understand what we're like and that 
process of understanding is what I see 

293
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:02,051
unfolding,
at least in part the biblical stories 

294
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:02,870
and it's.
It's halting and partial and awkward and

295
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:07,871
contradictory and and all of that,
which is one of the things that makes 

296
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,850
the book so complex,
but I see in it the struggle of humanity

297
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,050
to arise,
to rise above its animal forebear say,

298
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,600
and to become conscious of what it means
to be human.

299
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,130
And that's a very difficult thing 
because we don't know who we are,

300
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,520
what we are,
where we came from.

301
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:27,521
One of those things,
and you know the light life is an 

302
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,700
unbroken chain going back three and a 
half billion years.

303
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:33,701
It's an absolutely unbelievable thing.
Every single one of your ancestors 

304
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,810
reproduce successfully for three and a 
half billion years.

305
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,430
It's absolutely unbelievable.
We rose out of the dirt and the muck and

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,640
here we are conscious,
but not knowing and we're trying to 

307
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,630
figure out who we are and a story that 
we've been telling her,

308
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:52,200
a set of stories that we've telling for 
3000 years seems to me to have something

309
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,540
to offer.
And so when,

310
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,960
when I look at the stories in the Bible,
I do it.

311
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,330
I would say in some sense with a 
beginner's mind,

312
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,440
it's,
it's a mystery.

313
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:03,270
This book,
how the Hell it was made,

314
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,100
why it was made,
why we preserved it,

315
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,370
how it happened to motivated and entire 
culture for 2000 years and to transform 

316
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,540
the world like what's going on?

317
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,540
How did that happen?
It's by no means obvious and one of the 

318
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,811
things that bothers me about casual 
critics of religion is that they don't 

319
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,370
take the phenomena seriously and it's a 
serious phenomenon.

320
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:26,220
I mean,
I'm not at least because people have the

321
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:29,280
capacity for religious experience and no
one knows why that is.

322
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,400
I mean you can induce it reliably and 
all sorts of different ways.

323
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,150
You could do it with brain stimulation.
You can certainly do it with drugs.

324
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:38,220
There's especially the psychedelic 
variety.

325
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:43,221
They produce intimations of the divine.
Extraordinarily regularly.

326
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:46,830
People have been using drugs like that 
for God only knows how long,

327
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,030
50,000
years,

328
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:53,031
maybe more than that,
to produce some sort of intimate union 

329
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:57,201
with the divine.
It's like we don't understand any of 

330
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:59,721
that.
When we discovered the psychedelics in 

331
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,581
the late sixties,
it shocked everybody so badly that they 

332
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,660
were instantly made illegal and 
abandoned in terms of research for like 

333
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,230
50 years and it's no wonder because who 
the hell would expected that?

334
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,710
Nobody now,
now young was a student of niches.

335
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,950
You see him.
He was also,

336
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,500
I would say at the very astute critic of
Nicha.

337
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,480
He was educated by Freud and Freud.
Freud,

338
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,080
I suppose in some sense started to 
collate,

339
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,090
collate the information that we had 
pertaining to the notion that people 

340
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,640
lived inside a dream.
You know,

341
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:36,630
it was Freud who really popularized the 
idea of the unconscious mind,

342
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
and we take this for granted to such a 
degree today that we don't understand 

343
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,060
how revolutionary the idea was like with
what's happened with Freud is that we've

344
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:48,060
taken all the marrow out of his bones,
so to speak,

345
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,630
and less the husk behind.
And you know,

346
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,640
now when we think about Freud,
we just think about the husk because 

347
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,940
that's everything that's been discarded,
but so much of what he discovered is 

348
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,230
part of our popular conception now,
including the idea that your perceptions

349
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,660
and your actions and your thoughts are 
all,

350
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,370
um,
what would you say,

351
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:10,371
informed and shaped by unconscious 
motivations that are not part of your 

352
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:11,690
voluntary control.

353
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,740
And that's a very,
very strange thing.

354
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:18,741
It's one of the most unsettling things 
about the psychoanalytic theories 

355
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,190
because the psychoanalytic theories are 
something like,

356
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,610
you're a loose collection of living 
subpersonalities each with its own set 

357
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,010
of motivations and perceptions and 
emotions and rationales,

358
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:32,310
all of that.
And you have limited control over that.

359
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,620
So you're like a plurality of,
of,

360
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,530
of,
of internal personalities that's loosely

361
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:42,531
late into a unity.
You know that because you can't control 

362
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:47,031
yourself very well,
which is one of [inaudible] objections 

363
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:47,590
to niches,
idea that we could create our own values

364
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,700
so young didn't believe that especially 
not after interacting with Freud because

365
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:55,570
he saw that human beings were affected 
by things that were deeply,

366
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,690
deeply effected by things that were 
beyond their conscious control.

367
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,510
No one really knows how to conceptualize
those things.

368
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,590
You know the cognitive psychologists 
think about them in some senses.

369
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,750
Computational machines and the ancient 
people,

370
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,780
I think thought of them as gods.
Although it's more complex than that,

371
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:14,530
like rage would be a god Mars,
the regard of rage.

372
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,810
That's the thing that possesses you when
you're angry,

373
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,940
you know it has a viewpoint and it,
it it,

374
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:23,941
it says what it wants to say,
and that might have very little to do 

375
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,481
with what you want to say when you're 
being sensible and it doesn't just 

376
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:30,781
inhabit you.
It inhabits everyone and it lives 

377
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:33,091
forever and it even inhabits animals,
and so it's this transcendent 

378
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,100
psychological entity that inhabits the 
body politic like,

379
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,780
like a thought and habits.
The brain.

380
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:43,990
That's one way of thinking about it.
It's a very strange way of thinking,

381
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,991
but it certainly,
it certainly has its merits and so and 

382
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,500
those things well in some sense those 
are deities,

383
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:55,501
although it's not that simple and so you
ill was regard very interested in dreams

384
00:21:56,781 --> 00:22:01,781
to started to understand the 
relationship between dreams and myths 

385
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:03,190
because he would see in his client's 
dreams,

386
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,370
echoes of stories that he knew because 
he was deeply read in mythology and and 

387
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,020
then he started to believe that the 
dream was the birthplace of the myth and

388
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:14,920
that there was a continual interaction 
between the two processes,

389
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,100
the dream and the story and storytelling
and well,

390
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:23,101
you know,
you tend to tell your dreams as stories 

391
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:23,740
when you remember them and some people 
remember dreams all the time,

392
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,150
like two or three a night.

393
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,150
I've had clients like that and they 
often have archetipal dreams that have 

394
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,960
very clear mythological structures.
I think that's more the case with people

395
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:36,961
who are creative by the way,
especially if they're a bit unstable at 

396
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:40,611
at the time because the dream tends to 
occupy the space of uncertainty and to 

397
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:44,560
concentrate on fleshing out the the 
unknown reality.

398
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:48,370
Before you get a real grip on it,
so it's like the dream is the birthplace

399
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:50,620
of thinking.
That's a good way of thinking about it,

400
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,420
and so because it's the birthplace of 
thinking,

401
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:57,421
it's not that clear.
It's doing its best to formulate 

402
00:22:57,421 --> 00:23:00,940
something that was [inaudible] notion as
opposed to Freud who believed that there

403
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:05,941
were sensors,
internal sensors that were hiding the 

404
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:05,941
dreams.
True message.

405
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,620
That's not what you and believed.
He believed the dream was doing its best

406
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,950
to excel,
to express a reality that was still 

407
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,460
outside of fully articulated conscious 
comprehension.

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,870
It was [inaudible].
You think,

409
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:18,760
look,
a thought appears in your head,

410
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,870
right?
That's obvious.

411
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,240
Bang.
It's nothing you ever ask about,

412
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,960
but what the hell does that mean?
A thought appears in your head?

413
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,570
What kind of ridiculous explanation is 
that?

414
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,320
You know,
it just doesn't help with anything.

415
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,330
Where does it come from?
Well,

416
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,940
nowhere.
It just appears in my head.

417
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Okay,
well that's not a very sophisticated 

418
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,060
explanation as it turns out,
you know,

419
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,810
and so you might think that those 
thoughts,

420
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:45,950
thoughts that you think,
well where do they come from?

421
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:50,951
Oh,
they're often someone else's thoughts 

422
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:50,951
right?
Someone Long Dad,

423
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,730
that might be part of it,
just like the words you use to think our

424
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:57,731
utterances of people who've been long 
dead and so you're informed by the 

425
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,830
spirit of your ancestors.
That's one way of looking at it and your

426
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,780
motivation.
Speak to your motion,

427
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:06,740
speak to in your body,
speaks to you and it all does all that,

428
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,630
at least in part through the dream.

429
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,190
And the dream is the birthplace of the 
fully articulated idea.

430
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,880
They don't just come from nowhere.
Fully fledged,

431
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,490
right?
They have a developmental origin and god

432
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,490
only knows how long.
How lengthy that origin is.

433
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,460
Even to say something like,
I am conscious,

434
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,460
you know,
that's taken chimpanzees.

435
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,530
Don't say that,
you know,

436
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:34,250
it's been 7 million years since we broke
from chimpanzees,

437
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,260
something like that from the common 
ancestor.

438
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,290
You know,
they have no articulated knowledge at 

439
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,091
all and very little self representation 
in some sense and very little self 

440
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:45,470
consciousness.
And that's not the case with us at all.

441
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,460
And we had to painstakingly figure all 
of this out during that,

442
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,530
you know,
7 million year voyage.

443
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,180
And I think some of that's represented.
And,

444
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,030
and,
and,

445
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,330
and captured in some sense in these 
ancient stories,

446
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,360
which I believe were part of,
especially the oldest stories in 

447
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,351
genesis,
which is the stories we're going to 

448
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:10,271
start with that they were at that,
that some of the archaic nature of the 

449
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:13,940
human being is encapsulated in those 
stories and it's very,

450
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,580
very instructive as far as I can tell.

451
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,560
I can give you just a quick example.
You know,

452
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,240
there's an idea of sacrifice in,
in,

453
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,340
in,
in the Old Testament and it's pretty 

454
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,340
barbaric.
You know what I mean?

455
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,080
The story of Abraham and Isaac is a good
example of that because Abraham is 

456
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,440
called on to actually sacrifice his own 
son,

457
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:35,441
which doesn't really seem like something
that a reasonable God would ask you to 

458
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:35,441
do.
Right.

459
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:39,341
Then the garden in the Old Testament,
it's frequently cruel and arbitrary and 

460
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:43,750
demanding and paradoxical and which,
which is one of the things that really 

461
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,771
gives the book life because it wasn't 
edited by a committee or a committee 

462
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:50,900
that was concerned with,
with not offending anyone.

463
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,900
That's for sure.
So,

464
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,630
so young believed that the dream was the
birthplace of thought and I've been 

465
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:14,650
extending that idea because one of the 
things I wondered about deeply was,

466
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,710
you know,
you have a dream and then someone 

467
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,111
interprets it and you can argue about 
whether or not an interpretation is 

468
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:25,261
valid,
just like you can argue about whether 

469
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:25,660
your interpretation of a novel or movie 
is valid,

470
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,450
right?
It's a very difficult thing to determine

471
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:32,410
with any degree of accuracy accounts in 
part for the postmodern critique.

472
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,830
But my observation has been that people 
will present a dream and sometimes we 

473
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:42,850
can extract out real useful information 
from it that the person didn't appear to

474
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
know now and they get a flash of 
insight.

475
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:51,321
And to me that's a marker that we 
stumbled on something that unites part 

476
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,500
of that person that wasn't united 
before.

477
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:57,501
It pulls things together,
which is often what a good story we'll 

478
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:57,501
do where sometimes a good theory,
you know,

479
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:01,320
things snap together for you and there's
a little light goes on.

480
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,670
And that's one of the markers that I've 
used for accuracy and dreams.

481
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,460
And I know in my own family,
uh,

482
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,410
when,
when I was first married,

483
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,010
you know,
I'd have fights with my wife arguments 

484
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,021
about this and that and I'm fairly hot 
headed and so I'd get all puffed up and 

485
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,860
agitated about,
about whatever we were arguing about and

486
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,400
she'd go to sleep,
which was really annoying as so annoying

487
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,650
because I couldn't sleep right.
I like chewing off my fingernails and 

488
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,270
she'd be like sleeping peacefully beside
me.

489
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,510
It's maddening.
So,

490
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,370
but often she'd have a dream,
you know,

491
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:43,371
and then the next morning she discuss it
with me and then we could unravel what 

492
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,731
was at the bottom of our argument.
And that was unbelievably useful even 

493
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,070
though it was extraordinarily 
aggravating.

494
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,350
So,
so,

495
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,720
you know,
I was convinced by young,

496
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,730
it looked to me like his ideas about the
relationship between dreams and 

497
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,340
mythology and drama and literature made 
sense to me in the and the uh,

498
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,600
and,
and the relationship between that and 

499
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,600
art.

500
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,760
I know this native carver,
he's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy.

501
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,590
He's carved a bunch of wooden 
sculptures,

502
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,960
totem poles and masks that I have in my 
house.

503
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,810
And he's a very interesting person,
not literate,

504
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:16,350
not particularly literate,
and really still steeped in this ancient

505
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,070
13,000
year old tradition,

506
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,080
these original language speaker and um,
the fact that he isn't literate has sort

507
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:27,450
of left Camden with the mind of someone 
who's preliterate and preliterate people

508
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:29,130
aren't stupid,
they're just not literate.

509
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:32,090
So their brains are organized 
differently in many ways.

510
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:34,140
And I've asked him about his,
his,

511
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,260
his intuition for his carvings.
And He's told me that he dreams,

512
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,280
like you've seen the Haida masks,
you know,

513
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:42,240
what they look like.
Well,

514
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,990
his people are,
are closely related to the hightest,

515
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,991
so it's the same kind of style.
He said he dreams in those animals and,

516
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,980
and can remember his dreams.

517
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,980
And he also talks to his grandparents 
who taught him how to carve in his 

518
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,241
dreams.
Quite often if he runs into a problem 

519
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,461
with carving,
his grandparents will come and he'll 

520
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:04,461
talk to them.
But he sees that the creatures that he's

521
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:09,210
going to carve living in an animated 
sense soon as in his imagination.

522
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,980
And I mean,
it's not that difficult.

523
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,810
First of all,
I have no reason to disbelieve him.

524
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:17,811
He's a very,
very straightforward person and he 

525
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:20,391
doesn't have the motivation or the guy 
all I would say in some sense to invent 

526
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:25,101
a story like that.
There's just no reason that you would 

527
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:25,101
possibly do it.
I don't think he's told that many people

528
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:26,490
about it.
He thinks it's kinda crazy.

529
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,200
You know?
He said when he was a kid,

530
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,350
he thought he was insane because he'd 
had those dreams all the time about 

531
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,420
these creatures and so forth and so it 
wasn't something he was trumpeting,

532
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,900
but I found it fascinating because I can
see in him of the manifestation of this 

533
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,910
unbroken tradition,
we have no idea how traditions like that

534
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,520
are really passed along for thousands 
and thousands of years.

535
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,340
Right.
Part of it's oral and memory,

536
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,640
part of it's acted out dramatized and 
then part of it's going to be 

537
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,250
imaginative and people who aren't 
literate,

538
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,410
they store information quite differently
than we do.

539
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,840
We don't remember anything.
It's all written down in books.

540
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,790
Right?
But if you're from an oral culture,

541
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,110
especially if you're trained in that 
way,

542
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,360
you have all of that information at 
hand,

543
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
both so you can speak.
You can tell the stories and you really 

544
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,931
know them and you know,
modern people don't really know what 

545
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,451
that's like anymore doubt if there's 
more than maybe two of you in the 

546
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:21,571
audience that could spout for memory,
like a 30 line poem on poetry was 

547
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:24,020
written so that people could do that,
that,

548
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:29,021
that that's why we have that form is so 
that people could remember it and have 

549
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:30,640
it with them and we don't do any of that
anymore.

550
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,690
Anyways,
back to you and was a great believer in 

551
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,641
the dream and I noted that dreams will 
tell you things that you don't know and 

552
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:41,641
then I thought,
well,

553
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:45,400
how the hell can that be?
How in the world can something you think

554
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,630
up tell you something you don't know?
How does that make any sense?

555
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,600
First of all,
why don't you understand it?

556
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,270
Why does it have to come forth in the 
form of the dream?

557
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,420
It's like you're not.
There's something going on inside you 

558
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,880
that you don't control rights.
The dream happens.

559
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,160
Do you just like life happens to you.
I mean,

560
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,010
there is the odd lucid dreamer who can,
you know,

561
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,200
apply a certain amount of conscious 
control,

562
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:13,201
but most of the time it's you're laying 
there asleep and it's crazy complicated.

563
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:18,010
World manifests itself inside you and 
you don't know how you couldn't.

564
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:21,430
You can't do it when you're awake and 
you don't know what it means.

565
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,430
It's like what the hell is going on?
And that's one of the things that's so 

566
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,510
damn frightening about the 
psychoanalysts because you get this both

567
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:33,511
from Freud and young.
You really start to understand that 

568
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:36,901
there are things inside you that are 
happening that control you instead of 

569
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:37,270
the other way around.
You know,

570
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,830
there's a bit of reciprocal control,
but there's manifestations of spirits,

571
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:46,831
so to speak inside you that determine 
the manner in which you walk through 

572
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:51,571
life and you don't control it.
And what does is it random.

573
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:56,641
You know,
there are people who have claimed that 

574
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:57,430
dreams are mirror merely the consequence
of random neuronal firing,

575
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:02,431
which is a theory I think is absolutely 
absurd because there's nothing random 

576
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:02,940
about dreams.
You know,

577
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,560
there are very,
very structured and very,

578
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:10,561
very complex and they're not like snow 
on a television screen or or static on a

579
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:15,631
radio like those things are complicated 
and and then also I've seen so often 

580
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:18,970
that people have very coherent dreams 
that have a perfect narrative structure.

581
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,700
Now they're fully developed in some 
sense and so that just doesn't hide,

582
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,580
that theory just doesn't go anywhere 
with me.

583
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:29,200
I just can't see that as useful at all 
and so,

584
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,260
so I'm more likely to take the phenomena
seriously say,

585
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:37,261
well,
there's something to dreams what you 

586
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:39,841
dream of the future,
and then you try to make it into a 

587
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:39,841
reality that seems to be an important 
thing,

588
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,910
or maybe you dream up a nightmare and 
try to make that into a reality because 

589
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,530
people do that too.
If they're hell bent on revenge,

590
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,660
for example,
and full of hatred and resentment,

591
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,260
that manifests itself and terrible 
fantasies,

592
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,400
you know,
those are dreams.

593
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,610
Then people go act them out.
These things are powerful,

594
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,670
you know,
and whole nations can get caught up in 

595
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:00,670
collective dreams.
That's what happened to the Nazis.

596
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,531
That's what happened to Nazi Germany in 
the 19 thirties and it was absolutely 

597
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:05,780
remarkable,
amazing,

598
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:10,781
horrific destructive spectacle.
And the same thing happened in the 

599
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:11,180
Soviet Union.
The same thing happened in China.

600
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,880
It's like we have to take these things 
seriously,

601
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,310
you know,
and try to understand what's going on.

602
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,370
So you believe that the dream could 
contain more information than was yet 

603
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:26,590
articulated.
You think artists do the same thing,

604
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:31,591
you know,
like people go to museums and they look 

605
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:34,771
at paintings,
renaissance paintings or modern 

606
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:34,771
paintings and they don't exactly know 
why they're there.

607
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Now I was in this room and in New York,
I don't remember which museum,

608
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,280
but he was a room full of renaissance 
art,

609
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,530
you know,
great painters,

610
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,440
the greatest painters and thought maybe 
that room was worth a billion dollars or

611
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,930
something outrageous because there were 
like 20 paintings in there,

612
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,550
you know,
so priceless.

613
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,230
And the first thing is,
well,

614
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,710
why are those paintings worth so much 
and why is there a museum in the biggest

615
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:01,711
city in the world devoted to them?
And why do people from all over the 

616
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:02,890
world come and look at them?
What the hell are those people doing?

617
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,170
One of them was of the assumption of 
Mary,

618
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,730
you know,
beautifully painted,

619
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,080
absolutely glowing work of art and 
there's like 20 people standing in front

620
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:13,810
of it looking at it and think,
what are those people up to?

621
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,370
You know,
they don't know.

622
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:18,640
Why did they make a pilgrimage to New 
York to come and look at that painting?

623
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,340
It's not like they know why is it worth 
so much?

624
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,370
I mean,
I know there's a status element to it 

625
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,370
too,
but that begs the question,

626
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,940
why did those items become such high 
status items?

627
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,910
What is it about them that so absolutely
remarkable?

628
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,580
Well,
we're strange creatures,

629
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,830
so I was trying to figure out in part,
well where did the information that's in

630
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:43,831
the dream come from?
It has to come from somewhere and you 

631
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,280
can think about it as a revelation,
you know,

632
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,740
because it's,
it's like it springs out of the void and

633
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:50,220
it's new knowledge and it's a revelation
you didn't produce it,

634
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,880
it just,
it just appears.

635
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,240
But that's one of the things I want to 
do with this series.

636
00:34:55,241 --> 00:35:00,241
It's like I am scientifically minded and
I'm quite a rational person and I like 

637
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:03,700
to have an explanation for things that's
rational and empirical before I look for

638
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:08,080
any other kind of explanation and I 
don't want to say that everything that's

639
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:13,081
associated with divinity can be reduced 
in some manner to biology or to an 

640
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,230
evolutionary history or anything like 
that,

641
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,800
but in so far as it's possible to do 
that reduction,

642
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,980
I'm going to do that and I'm going to 
leave the other phenomena floating in 

643
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,271
the air because they can't be pinned 
down and in that category I would put 

644
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,990
the category of mystical or religious 
experience,

645
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,490
which we don't understand at all.

646
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,760
So

647
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,940
artists observe one another.
They observe and they represent what 

648
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,360
they see and they transmit a message of 
what they see to us and they teach us to

649
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:45,930
see and we don't necessarily know what 
it is that we're learning from them,

650
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:51,610
but we're learning something or at least
we're acting like we're learning 

651
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:51,610
something.
We go to movies,

652
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,320
we watch stories.
We,

653
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,100
we,
we,

654
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,680
we immerse ourselves in fiction 
constantly.

655
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,650
That's an artistic production and for 
many people,

656
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,250
the world of the arts is a living world 
and that's particularly true if you're a

657
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,490
creative person.
It's the creative artistic people that 

658
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,881
do move the knowledge of humanity 
forward and they do that with their 

659
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:11,160
artistic productions.
First.

660
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:16,161
They're on the edge and the dancers do 
that and the poets do that and the 

661
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:20,450
visual artists do that at the musicians 
do that and we're not sure what they're 

662
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:20,450
doing.

663
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,110
We're not sure what musicians are doing,
what the hell are they doing?

664
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,910
Why do you like music?
You know,

665
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:28,911
it gives you a deep intimation of the 
significance of things and no one 

666
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:30,690
questions that you go to a concert,
you're thrilled.

667
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:35,691
It's a quasi religious experience,
particularly if the people really get 

668
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:37,260
themselves together and get the crowd 
moving.

669
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:42,261
You know,
there's something incredibly intense 

670
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:42,261
about it,
but it makes no sense whatsoever.

671
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:43,740
It's,
it's not an easy thing to understand.

672
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,590
Music is deeply patterned and and,
and,

673
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:51,591
and patterned in layers and I think that
has something to do with it because 

674
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:53,490
reality is patterned and deeply 
patterned in layers.

675
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:57,990
And so I think music is representing 
reality in some fundamental way and that

676
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:01,860
we get into the sway of that and sort of
participate in being.

677
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:05,400
And that's part of what makes it such an
uplifting experience.

678
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,650
But we don't really know that's what 
we're doing.

679
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:08,850
We just go do it.
And,

680
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,900
and,
and,

681
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,970
and it's nourishing for people,
right?

682
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:16,971
I mean,
young people in particular that lots of 

683
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:20,391
them live for music.
It's where they derive all their 

684
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:20,391
meaning,
their cultural identity.

685
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:24,590
Everything that's nourishing comes from 
their affiliation with their music that 

686
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,760
is part of their cultural identity.
So that's an amazing thing.

687
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,660
The question still remains,
where does the information and dreams 

688
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,260
come from?
And I think what it,

689
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,630
where it comes from is that we watch the
patterns that everyone.

690
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,370
So we've watched that forever and we've 
got some representations of those 

691
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,290
patterns.
That's part of our cultural history.

692
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:54,291
That's what's embedded in stories,
in fictional accounts of the story 

693
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:58,161
between good and evil.
The bad guy and the good guy and the 

694
00:37:58,161 --> 00:37:58,161
romance,
you know,

695
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:01,131
these are,
these are canonical patterns of being 

696
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:03,711
for people in and they deeply affect 
this because they represent what it is 

697
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:07,191
that we will act out in the world and 
then we flesh that out with the 

698
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:10,551
individual information we have about 
ourselves and other people and so it's 

699
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:11,340
like there's a,
there's a,

700
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,580
there's waves of,
of behavioral patterns that manifest 

701
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,021
themselves in the crowd across time that
great dramas are played on the crowd 

702
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:26,271
across time and the artists watched that
and they get intimations of what that is

703
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:31,611
and they write it down and they tell us 
and then we're a little clearer about 

704
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:31,611
what we're up to now.

705
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:35,990
Like a great dramatists like Shakespeare
let's say is we know that what he wrote 

706
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,160
is fiction and then we say,
well,

707
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,560
fiction isn't true,
but then you think,

708
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,450
well wait a minute.
Maybe it's true.

709
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,970
Like numbers are true.
You know,

710
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,910
numbers are an abstraction from the 
underlying reality,

711
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,690
but no one in their right mind would 
really think numbers aren't true.

712
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,870
You could even make a case that the 
numbers are more real than the things 

713
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,870
that they represent,
right?

714
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,220
Because the abstraction is so insanely 
powerful.

715
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,010
Once you have mathematics,
you're just deadly.

716
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,220
You can move the world with mathematics 
and so it's not obvious that the 

717
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,001
abstraction is less real than the than 
the than the more concrete reality and 

718
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,550
you take a work of fiction like hamlet 
and you think,

719
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:17,551
well,
is that it's not true because it's 

720
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:17,551
fiction,
but then you think,

721
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:18,610
wait a minute.
What kind of explanation is that?

722
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,790
Like maybe it's more true than 
nonfiction because it takes what the 

723
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,871
story that needs to be told about you 
and the story that needs to be told 

724
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,440
about you and you and you and you and 
abstracts that out and says,

725
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:34,441
look,
here's something that's a key part of 

726
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:34,990
the human experience as such.
Right?

727
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,480
So it's.
It's an abstraction from this underlying

728
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,690
noisy substrate and people are affected 
by it because they see that the thing 

729
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,050
that's represented the as part of the 
pattern of their being,

730
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,560
that's the right way to think about it.
And then with these old stories,

731
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:55,561
these ancient stories,
it seems to me like that process has 

732
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,171
been occurring for thousands of years.
It's like we watched ourselves and we 

733
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:02,551
extracted out some stories,
we imitated each other and we 

734
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:06,211
represented that in drama and then we 
distilled the drama and we got a 

735
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:08,690
representation of the distillation and 
then we did it again.

736
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,050
And at the end of that process that 
took,

737
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,530
God only knows how long.
I think some of these stories,

738
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,310
they've traced fairytales back 10,000
years,

739
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,970
some fairy tales in relatively unchanged
for.

740
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,700
And it certainly seems to me that the 
archeological evidence,

741
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:29,701
for example,
suggests that the really old stories 

742
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:29,701
that,
that,

743
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:32,570
that the Bible begins with our,
at least that old and likely embedded in

744
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,650
a prehistory that's far older than that,
you might think,

745
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:38,110
well,
how can you be so sure?

746
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,070
The answer to that in part is that 
cultures that don't change,

747
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,860
like the ancient cultures,
right?

748
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,540
They didn't change as fast as they 
stayed the same.

749
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,970
That's the answer.
So they call it,

750
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,880
they keep their information moving 
generation to generation.

751
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,790
That's how they stay the same.
And so we know,

752
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,410
again,
in the archaeological record,

753
00:40:56,411 --> 00:41:01,411
there are records of rituals that have 
remained relatively unbroken for up to 

754
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:01,540
20,000
years.

755
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,750
It was discovered in caves in Japan that
were set up for a particular kind of 

756
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,550
bare worship that was also 
characteristic of western Europe.

757
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,100
So these things can last for very long 
periods of time.

758
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,310
We're watching each other act in the 
world,

759
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,050
and then the question is,
well,

760
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,090
how long have we been watching each 
other?

761
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,510
And the answered that in some senses,
while as long as there's been creatures 

762
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,500
with nervous systems now that's a long 
time,

763
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:34,501
you know,
that's some hundreds of millions of 

764
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:34,501
years,
perhaps longer than that.

765
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:38,290
We've been watching each other trying to
figure out what we're up to across that 

766
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,591
entire span of time and some of that 
knowledge is built right into our 

767
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:44,951
bodies,
which is why we can dance with each 

768
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:44,951
other,
for example.

769
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:47,831
Right?
Because understanding isn't just 

770
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:49,070
something that you,
that you have as an abstraction,

771
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:50,860
it's something that you act out.
No,

772
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,140
that's what children are doing when 
they're learning too rough and tumble 

773
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,860
play is they're learning to integrate 
their body with the body of someone else

774
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,770
in a harmonious way,
learning to cooperate and compete,

775
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,620
and that's all instantiated right into 
their body.

776
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,710
It's not abstract knowledge.
They don't know that they're doing that.

777
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,890
They're just doing it and so we can even
use our body as a representational 

778
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,941
platform,
so we'd been studying each other for a 

779
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:18,260
long time.
Abstracting out what is it that we're up

780
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,690
to and that's that.
That's what we're up to.

781
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:24,260
What should we be up to?
That's even a more fundamental question.

782
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,410
If you're going to live in the world and
you're going to do it properly,

783
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,400
what does properly mean and how is it 
that you might go about that?

784
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,470
Well,
it.

785
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,950
It's the right question,
right?

786
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,470
It's what everyone wants to know.
How do you live in the world?

787
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,380
Not what is the world made of.
It's not the same question.

788
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,590
How do you live in the world?
It's the eternal question of human 

789
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,711
beings and I guess we're the only 
species that has ever really asked that 

790
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:49,730
question because all the other animals,
they just go and do whatever they do,

791
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,840
not us.

792
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,510
It's a question for us.
We've had to.

793
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,690
We have to become aware of it.
We have to be able to speak it.

794
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,710
God only knows why,
but that seems to be the situation.

795
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,580
So we act that acting is shaped by the 
world,

796
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:10,040
that acting is shaped by society into 
something that we don't understand,

797
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,870
but that we can model,
that we can model it.

798
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:17,871
We model it in our stories.
We Marlett with our bodies and that's 

799
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:21,911
where the dream gets its information.
The dream is part of the process that's 

800
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:24,380
watching everything and then trying to 
formulate it and trying to say,

801
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:29,381
well,
trying to get the signal from the noise 

802
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:32,051
and to portray it in dramatic form 
because a dream is a little drama and 

803
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:35,591
then you get the chance to talk about 
what that dream is and then you have.

804
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,050
You have something like articulated 
knowledge at that point.

805
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:44,890
And so the Bible I would say is,
is it sort of exists in that space 

806
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:48,410
that's half into the dream and half into
articulated knowledge.

807
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,560
It's something like that and going into 
it to find out what the stories are 

808
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,870
about can,
what can,

809
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,270
what can aid our self understanding.
And then the other issue is,

810
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:05,271
is that if nature was correct and if 
Dostoevsky or young was correct and 

811
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:10,151
Dostoevsky as well,
we without the cornerstone that that 

812
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:13,460
understanding provides,
were lost.

813
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,590
And that's not good because then we're 
susceptible to psych pathology.

814
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,650
That's psychological pathology.
You know,

815
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,750
the people who are ad adamant,
anti religious thinkers seem to believe 

816
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:31,890
that if we abandoned our immersement in 
the underlying dream,

817
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:32,010
that

818
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,730
we'd all instantly become rationalist 
like descartes or Bacon or,

819
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,230
you know,
intelligent,

820
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,080
clear thinking,
rational scientific people.

821
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,280
I don't believe that for a moment 
because I don't think there's any 

822
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,900
evidence for it.
I think we would become so irrational so

823
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:50,901
rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of 
the Catholicism would see positively 

824
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,120
rational by contrast.
And I think that's already happening.

825
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,260
So.

826
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,740
Okay,

827
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,230
so this is the idea.
Essentially,

828
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:10,930
you know that you have the unknown world
at.

829
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,610
That's just what you don't know at all.
That's,

830
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,700
that's outside,
that's the ocean that surrounds the 

831
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:18,700
island,
that you inhabit something like that.

832
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,281
It's chaos itself and then you act in 
that world and you act in ways you don't

833
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:25,960
understand.
There's more to your actions.

834
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,600
Then you can understand.
One of the things young said,

835
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,370
I love this.
When I first understood it,

836
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:32,410
he said,
everybody acts out of myth,

837
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,550
but very few people know what their myth
is and you should know what your myth is

838
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:40,540
because it might be a tragedy and maybe 
you don't want it to be,

839
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,120
and that's really worth thinking because
thinking about,

840
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:48,121
because you're.
You have a pattern of behavior that 

841
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:48,940
characterized as you know,
when God only knows where you got it.

842
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,500
Partly it's biological.

843
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,000
Partly it's from your parents.
It's,

844
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,180
it's your unconscious assumptions.
It's the way the philosophy of your 

845
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,030
society is shaped you and is.
It's aimed.

846
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,820
It's aiming you somewhere.
Well,

847
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,920
is it aiming you somewhere you want to 
go?

848
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,040
That's a good question.
That's part of self realization.

849
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,250
You know,
we know we don't understand our actions.

850
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,850
That's almost every argument you have 
with someone is about that.

851
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:14,470
It's like,
why did you do that?

852
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,170
You come up with some half baked reasons
why you did it.

853
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,510
You're flailing around in the darkness.
You know,

854
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:22,990
you try to give an account for yourself,
but you can only do it partially.

855
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:26,280
It's very,
very difficult because you're in your,

856
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,820
you're a complicated animal with the 
beginnings of an articulated mind,

857
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:35,821
something like that.
And you're just way more than you can 

858
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:35,821
handle it.

859
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:35,821
And

860
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,190
Alright,
so you act things out,

861
00:46:39,191 --> 00:46:39,600
right?
You,

862
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,240
you act things out and that's a kind of 
competence.

863
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:48,241
And then you imagine what you act out 
and you imagine what everyone else acts 

864
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:52,111
out and so there's a tremendous amount 
of information in your action and then 

865
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,330
that information is translated up into 
the dream and into art,

866
00:46:55,331 --> 00:47:00,331
into mythology and literature.
And there's a tremendous amount of 

867
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,170
information in that.
And then some of that is translated into

868
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:07,171
articulated thought.
And I'll give you a quick example of 

869
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:10,711
something like that.
I think this is partly what happens in 

870
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:11,170
exodus when Moses comes up with the law,
you know,

871
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:16,171
he's wandering around with the 
Israelites forever in the desert and 

872
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:18,880
are,
they're like going left and going right 

873
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,420
worshiping idols and like having a hell 
of a time and um,

874
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,660
you know,
getting rebellious and Moses goes up on 

875
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,361
the mountain and he has this tremendous 
revelation sort of in the sight of God 

876
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,350
and illuminates him and he comes down 
with the law.

877
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,190
You think,
well,

878
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,170
you know,
Moses acted as a judge.

879
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,250
I know this is a mythological story.
Moses acted as a judge in the desert.

880
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:41,251
He was continually mediating between 
people who are having problems 

881
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,581
constantly trying to keep peace.
And so what are you doing when you're 

882
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:47,881
trying to keep peace?
As you're trying to understand what 

883
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:47,881
peace is,
right?

884
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:49,600
You have to apply the principles,
but what are the principles?

885
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,950
But you don't know the principals or 
whatever satisfies people enough to make

886
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:56,290
peace.
And maybe you do that 10,000

887
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,970
times and then you get some sense of,
Oh,

888
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:02,971
here's the principles that bring peace 
and then one day at blasts into your 

889
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:02,971
consciousness,
like,

890
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:08,100
like a revelation,
here's the rules that were already 

891
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,720
acting out.
Well that's the 10 commandments.

892
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:13,721
It's,
they're there to begin with and Moses 

893
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:13,721
comes forward and says,
look,

894
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:14,740
this is already basically what we're 
doing.

895
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,600
But now it's codafide.
Right?

896
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,730
And like that's all historical process 
that's condensed into a single story.

897
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:25,150
But obviously that happened because we 
have written law,

898
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,540
right?
And that emerged in good legal systems 

899
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:30,700
that emerges from the bottom up.
That's English.

900
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:32,950
Common law is exactly like that,
right?

901
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:37,951
It's single decisions that are 
predicated on principles that have been 

902
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:40,250
articulated and made into the body of 
law.

903
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,790
And the body of law is something you act
out.

904
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,360
That's why it's a body of law.
If you're a good citizen,

905
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:50,080
you act out the body of law and the body
of law has principles.

906
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,910
Okay?
So the question is,

907
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,340
there's principles that guide our 
behavior.

908
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,620
What are those principles?
Well,

909
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:58,110
I think when you,
if you're,

910
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,390
if you want the initial answer of what 
the art archaic Israelites meant by God,

911
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,290
that something like what they meant now,
it's not a good enough explanation,

912
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,660
but look,
imagine that you,

913
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,960
that you have,
that you're a chimpanzee and you have a 

914
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:15,960
powerful,
uh,

915
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,090
a dominant figure at the pinnacle of 
your society that,

916
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,550
that represents power.

917
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,700
Now,
more than that because it's not sheer 

918
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:26,770
physical prowess that keeps a chimp at 
the top of the hierarchy,

919
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:29,230
it's much more complicated than that.
But you could say,

920
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:29,740
well,
there's,

921
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,330
there's a principle that a dominant 
person manifests,

922
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,520
and then you might say,
well,

923
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,400
that principals shines forth even more 
brightly.

924
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:43,150
If you know 10 people who are dominant,
powerful,

925
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,720
then you can extract out what dominance 
means from that.

926
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:51,721
You can extract out what power means 
from that and then you can divorce the 

927
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:55,261
concept from the people.
And we had to do that at some point 

928
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:59,431
because we can save power in a human 
context and we can imagine what that 

929
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:03,901
means,
but it's divorced from any specific 

930
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:03,901
manifestation of power.
Well,

931
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:08,521
how the hell did we do that?
Like that's so complicated when if 

932
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:11,050
you're a chimp,
the power is in another chimp.

933
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:13,990
It's not some damn abstraction.
Well,

934
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,850
so the.
So the question is think,

935
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:17,710
think about it when we're in these 
hierarchies,

936
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:22,711
many of them across centuries,
we're trying to figure out what the 

937
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,831
guiding principle is.
We're trying to extract out the core of 

938
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,280
the guiding principle and we turned that
into a representation

939
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,490
of a pattern of being well.
It's something like that.

940
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:36,030
That's God.
It's an abstracted ideal and it's.

941
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:37,820
It's,
it's put in persona.

942
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:41,160
Find form manifests itself in 
personified form,

943
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:43,700
but that's okay because what we're 
trying to get at is the,

944
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,120
in some sense,
the essence of what it means to be a 

945
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,920
properly functioning and properly a 
properly functioning properly social and

946
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:56,921
property competent individual.
We're trying to figure out what that 

947
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:57,680
means.
You need a an embodiment.

948
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,710
You need an ideal that's abstracted that
you could act out that would enable you 

949
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:06,830
to understand what that means and that's
what we've been driving out.

950
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,590
So that's the first hypothesis.
In some sense.

951
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,540
I'm going to go over some of the some of
the attributes of this abstract,

952
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:18,541
that ideal that we've formalized as God,
but that's the first sort of hypothesis 

953
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:22,451
is that a philosophical or moral ideal 
manifests itself first as a concrete 

954
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:28,871
pattern of behavior that's 
characteristic of a single individual 

955
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:32,650
and then it's a set of individuals and 
then it's an abstraction from that set 

956
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,330
and then you have the abstraction and so
important.

957
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,760
So here's a political implication.
For example,

958
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,690
one of the debates we might say between 
early Christianity and the late Roman 

959
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:57,201
empire was whether or not an emperor 
could be God literally right to be 

960
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:03,051
deified,
to put enough to be put in a temple and 

961
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:06,831
you can see why that might happen 
because that's someone at the pinnacle 

962
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:10,221
of a very steep hierarchy who has a 
tremendous amount of power and 

963
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,431
influence.
But the Christian response to that was 

964
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:17,660
never confuse the specific sovereign 
with the principle of sovereignty 

965
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:21,640
itself.
It's brilliant to see,

966
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,650
see how difficult it is to come up with 
an idea like that so that even the 

967
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,201
person who has the power is actually 
subordinate to something else 

968
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:32,280
subordinate to,
let's call it a divine principle,

969
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:37,281
for lack of a better word,
so even the king himself is subordinate 

970
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:41,841
to the principal and we still believe 
that because we believe that our 

971
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:44,070
president or prime minister is 
subordinate to the damn law.

972
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,840
Whatever the body of law,
right?

973
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:50,841
There's a principle inside that that 
even the leader is subordinate to and 

974
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,260
without that,
and you could argue we can't even have a

975
00:52:52,261 --> 00:52:57,261
civilized society because your.
Your leader immediately turns into 

976
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:00,561
something that's transcendent and all 
powerful and I mean that's certainly 

977
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:04,521
what happened in the Soviet Union and 
what happened in Maoist China and what 

978
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:07,791
happened in Nazi Germany because there 
was nothing for the powerful to 

979
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,211
subordinate themselves to.
You're supposed to be subordinate to 

980
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:11,970
God.
So what does that mean?

981
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,070
Well,
we're going to tear that idea part,

982
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:16,830
but partly what it means is that your 
subordinate,

983
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,220
even if you're sovereign to the 
principle of sovereignty itself,

984
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,820
and then the question is what the hell 
is the principle of sovereignty?

985
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:27,660
And I could say we been working that out
for a very long period of time,

986
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,080
and so that's one of the things that 
we'll talk about because the ancient 

987
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,591
Mesopotamians and the ancient Egyptians 
had some very interesting dramatic ideas

988
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:38,730
about that.

989
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,030
So is,
for example,

990
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:47,031
very briefly,
there was a dandy known as Marduk and 

991
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:48,270
Martech.
He was in Mesopotamia.

992
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:53,271
Daddy,
and imagine this is sorta what happened 

993
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,950
is that as an empire grew out of the 
post ice age age,

994
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:57,600
say 15,000
years ago,

995
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,680
10,000
years ago,

996
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,290
all these tribes came together in these 
tribes.

997
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,320
Each had their own data,
their own image of the ideal,

998
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,600
but then they started to occupy the same
territory,

999
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,570
right?
And so then one tribe had god,

1000
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:14,370
a in one tribe had God be and no one 
could wipe the other one out and then it

1001
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:19,371
would just be God a who wins.
But that's not so good because while 

1002
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:23,040
maybe you want to trade with those 
people or maybe you don't want to lose 

1003
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,370
half your population in a war or 
something like that,

1004
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:28,371
so then you have to have an argument 
about whose God is going to take 

1005
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:32,871
priority,
which ideal is going to take priority 

1006
00:54:32,871 --> 00:54:35,271
and what seems to happen is that's 
represented in mythology is a battle of 

1007
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,700
the gods in sort of celestial space,
but from a practical perspective,

1008
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:40,530
it's more like an ongoing dialogue.

1009
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,420
You believe this,
I believe this.

1010
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,070
You believe that,
I believe this.

1011
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:49,190
How are we going to Meld that together?
So you take God a and you take God be 

1012
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,130
and maybe what you do is extract God,
see from them and you say,

1013
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:56,160
well God see now has the attributes of a
and B,

1014
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,940
and then some other tribes come in and 
then see takes them over to.

1015
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:02,550
And so you get like with Marduk for 
example,

1016
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:05,550
he has a multitude of names,
50 different names.

1017
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:08,910
While those are names,
at least in part of the subordinate,

1018
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,870
God's that represented the tribes that 
came together to make the civilization.

1019
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,300
That's part of the process by which that
abstract,

1020
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:19,350
that ideal is abstractive.
You think this is important and it works

1021
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:24,351
because you're trying to lie,
but you think this is important and it 

1022
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:25,740
works because your tribe is alive and so
we'll take the best of both.

1023
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,740
If we could manage it and extract,
extract out something that's even more 

1024
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,370
abstract that covers both of us.
If we can do it.

1025
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,560
One of the things that's really 
interesting about,

1026
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,830
I'll just give you a couple of of his 
features,

1027
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,710
but he has eyes all the way around his 
head.

1028
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,470
He's elected by all the other gods to be
Katen God.

1029
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:48,471
So that's the first thing that's quite 
cool and they elect him because they're 

1030
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:52,400
facing a terrible threat,
sort of like a flood and a monster 

1031
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,400
combined,
something like that.

1032
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,720
And Martin basically says that if they 
elect him,

1033
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:59,721
top God,
then he'll go out and stop the flood 

1034
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:00,480
monster and they won't all get wiped 
out.

1035
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:02,850
It's a serious threat.
It's chaos itself,

1036
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,720
making its comeback.
And so all the gods agree and Martin has

1037
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:11,721
the new manifestation.
He's got eyes all the way around his 

1038
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:15,021
head and he speaks magic words,
and then he also goes out and when he 

1039
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:19,701
fights,
he fights this deity called Tiamat and 

1040
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:19,780
we need to know that because the word 
Taya,

1041
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,100
Matt is associated with the Word Tay.
Home t h o m

1042
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:29,340
entail is the chaos that God makes order
out of at the beginning of time in 

1043
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,200
genesis.
So it's linked very tightly to the story

1044
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,470
and Martin with his eyes and his 
capacity to speak.

1045
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:37,650
Magic words goes out to confront tie.
Matt,

1046
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,840
who's like a watery sea dragon,
something like that.

1047
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,160
It's a classic.
It's a classic St George Story.

1048
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:50,190
Go out and and recalc on the Dragon.
He cuts her into pieces and he makes the

1049
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,640
world out of her pieces and that's the 
world that human beings live in.

1050
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,760
The Mesopotamian emperor acted out 
Marduk.

1051
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:01,120
He was allowed to be emperor in so far 
as he was a good Marduk console.

1052
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,360
That meant that he had eyes all the way 
around his head and he could speak 

1053
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,390
magic.
He could speak properly and so that 

1054
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:09,640
we're starting to understand they're at 
that point,

1055
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:11,140
the essence of leadership,
right?

1056
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,370
Because what's leadership?

1057
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:17,370
It's the capacity to see what the hell 
is in front of your face and maybe in 

1058
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,331
every direction and then the capacity to
use your language properly in a 

1059
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:25,111
transformative manner and to transform 
chaos into order and God only know how 

1060
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,200
those,
how long it took the Mesopotamians to 

1061
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,161
figure that out,
and the best they could do is dramatize 

1062
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:32,710
it,
but it's staggeringly brilliant.

1063
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,520
No,
it's.

1064
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:38,521
It's by no means obvious in this chaos 
is chaos is a very strange thing and 

1065
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,620
this is the chaos that God wrestled with
at the beginning of time.

1066
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,010
Chaos is what it.
It's half psychological and half real.

1067
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,160
There's no other way to really describe 
it.

1068
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,900
The chaos is what you encounter when 
you're thrown into deep confusion,

1069
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,880
right?
When your world falls apart,

1070
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,700
when when you encounter something that 
blows you into pieces,

1071
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:59,980
when your dreams die,
when you're betrayed,

1072
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,000
it's the chaos that emerges and the 
chaos is everything at once and it's too

1073
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:09,001
much for you and that's for sure,
and it pulls you down into the 

1074
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:09,001
underworld and all.

1075
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:14,070
That's where the dragons are and all 
you've got at that point is your 

1076
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,861
capacity to bloody well keep your eyes 
open and to speak as carefully and 

1077
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:18,310
clearly as you can and maybe if you're 
lucky,

1078
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:22,150
you'll get through it that way and come 
out the other side and it's taken people

1079
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:27,151
a very long time to figure that out.
And it looks to me like the idea is 

1080
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:31,950
erected on the platform of our ancient 
ancestors maybe tens of millions of 

1081
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,900
years ago because we seem to represent 
that which disturbs us deeply using the 

1082
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:42,691
same system that we use to represent 
like serpentine while serpentine or 

1083
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:45,880
other carnivorous predators and it,
you know,

1084
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,590
we're biological creatures,
right?

1085
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:52,591
So when we've formulated our capacity to
abstract are strange capacity to 

1086
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:57,421
abstract and use language,
we still have all those underlying 

1087
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:00,121
systems that were there when we were 
only animals and we have to use those 

1088
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,420
systems there.

1089
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,420
They're part of the emotional and 
motivational architecture of our 

1090
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,730
thinking and part of the reason we can 
demonize our enemies who upset or axioms

1091
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:13,450
is because we perceive them as if 
they're carnivorous predators.

1092
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,200
We do it with the same system and that's
chaos itself.

1093
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,940
The thing that always threatens us,
right?

1094
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:23,941
The snakes that came to the trees,
we lived in them like 60 million years 

1095
00:59:23,941 --> 00:59:25,430
ago.
It's the same damn systems.

1096
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:31,090
So the Martech story is partly the story
of using attention to language to 

1097
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:36,341
confront those things that most 
threatened us and some of those things 

1098
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,740
are real,
real world threats,

1099
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,890
but some of them are psychological 
threats which are just as profound but 

1100
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,150
far more abstract,
but we use the same systems to represent

1101
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:48,320
them.
It's why you freeze.

1102
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,000
If you're frightened,
right?

1103
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,190
You're a prey animal.
You're like a rabbit,

1104
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:57,520
you've seen us,
you've seen something that's going to 

1105
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:57,520
eat you,
you freeze.

1106
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,940
And that way you're paralyzed,
you're turn to stone,

1107
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:02,900
which is what you do when you see a 
medusa with a head full of state snakes,

1108
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:04,130
right?
Your turned to stone,

1109
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:09,131
you're paralyzed,
and the reason you do that is because 

1110
01:00:09,131 --> 01:00:10,820
you're using the Predator detection 
system to protect yourself.

1111
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:14,180
Your heart rate goes way up and you get 
ready to move.

1112
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,920
Things that upset us,
rely on that system,

1113
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:21,470
and then the story.
The story for example,

1114
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:24,290
is the idea that if there are things 
that upset you,

1115
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,580
chaotic,
terrible,

1116
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,860
serpentine,
monstrous underworld,

1117
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:32,861
things that threaten you,
the best thing to do is to open your 

1118
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:36,071
eyes and get your speech organized and 
go out and confront the thing and make 

1119
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:37,880
the world out of it.
And it's staggering.

1120
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:42,881
When I,
when I read that story and started to 

1121
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:42,881
understand,
it just blew me away.

1122
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:44,660
It's such a profound idea,
and we know it's true too,

1123
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:46,790
because we know in psychotherapy for 
example,

1124
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,480
that you're much better off to confront 
your fears head on.

1125
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,420
Then you are to wait and let them find 
you.

1126
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,340
And so partly what you do if you're a 
psychotherapist,

1127
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,480
is you help people break their fears 
into little pieces,

1128
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:04,481
the things that upset them and into 
encounter them one by one and master 

1129
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:08,741
that when you're teaching this process 
of eternal mastery over the strange and 

1130
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:12,150
chaotic world and that all of that makes
up some of the background.

1131
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,230
We haven't even got to the first 
sentence of the biblical stories yet.

1132
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,130
Good.

1133
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,610
And all of that makes up the background.
So you have to think that we've 

1134
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:30,821
extracted this story.
These are this strange collection of 

1135
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:34,301
stories with all its errors and it's and
it's repetitions and its peculiarities 

1136
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:39,251
out of the entire.
Like the entire history that we've been 

1137
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:41,420
able to collect ideas and it's the best 
we've been able to do.

1138
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,600
And I know there are other religious 
traditions about not concerned about 

1139
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,220
that at the moment because we can use 
this as an example,

1140
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,200
but it's the basket we've been able to 
do.

1141
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:55,250
And what I'm hoping is that we can 
return to the stories in some sense with

1142
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:58,760
an open mind and see if there's 
something there that we actually need.

1143
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:03,110
And hope and I hope that that will be 
the case and as I said,

1144
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:05,480
all approaches as rationally as I 
possibly can,

1145
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:08,040
so well this is the idea to begin with,
you know,

1146
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,590
we have the unknown as such,
and then we act in it like animals act,

1147
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,930
they act first,
they don't think,

1148
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,440
they don't imagine they act and that's,
that's where we started.

1149
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,440
We started acting and then we started to
be able to represent how we acted and 

1150
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:28,641
then we started to talk about how we 
represented how we acted and that 

1151
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:30,690
enabled us to tell stories because that 
is what a story is.

1152
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:35,930
It's to tell about how you represent how
you act and so you know that because if 

1153
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:38,040
you read a book,
what happens?

1154
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,400
You read the board and images come to 
mind of the people in the book behaving,

1155
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,020
right?
It's one step from acting it out.

1156
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:48,540
It's you don't act it out cause you can 
abstract.

1157
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:51,630
You can represent action without having 
to act it out.

1158
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:56,870
It's amazing thing and that's part of 
the development of the prefrontal 

1159
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,541
cortex.
It's part of the capacity for human 

1160
01:02:59,541 --> 01:02:59,670
abstract thought is that you can pull 
the behavior,

1161
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:04,730
the representation of the behavior away 
from the behavior and manipulate the 

1162
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,961
representation before you enact it.
That's why you think it's so that you 

1163
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:14,391
can generate a pattern of action and 
tested out in a fictional world before 

1164
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,230
you embody it and die because you're 
foolish,

1165
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,410
right?
You let the representation die,

1166
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,810
not you,
and that's why you think.

1167
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,810
And so that's partly what we're trying 
to do with these stories.

1168
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,980
What do I hope to accomplish?
I hope to end this 12 lecture series 

1169
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:37,970
knowing more than I did when I started.
That's my goal because I said,

1170
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,100
you know,
I'm not telling you what I know.

1171
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:42,320
I'm trying to figure things out.
And,

1172
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,760
and,
and,

1173
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:48,050
and this is part of this is part of the 
process by which I'm doing that.

1174
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:51,170
And so I'm doing my best to think on my 
feet.

1175
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:51,480
You know,
what?

1176
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:55,370
I'm going to come prepared.
But I'm trying to stay on the edge of my

1177
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:59,870
capacity to generate knowledge and to 
make this continually clearer and to get

1178
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:03,200
to the bottom of things.
And so I'm hoping that that's what I'm,

1179
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,590
that's what I want to accomplish and it 
seems like people are interested in 

1180
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,050
that.
So then we're going to try to accomplish

1181
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:10,550
that together.
And so that's the,

1182
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:16,030
that's the plan and the idea is to see 
if there's something at the bottom of 

1183
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,980
this amazing civilization that we've 
managed to construct

1184
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:26,430
did I think is in peril for a variety of
reasons and maybe if we understand it a 

1185
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:28,200
little bit,
little bit better,

1186
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,240
we won't be so prone just to throw the 
damn thing away,

1187
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:36,390
which I think would be a big mistake.
And to throw it away because of 

1188
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:39,040
resentment and hatred and bitterness and
historical ignorance and jealousy and,

1189
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,960
and,
and,

1190
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,400
and the desire for destruction and all 
of that.

1191
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:47,401
It's like I don't want to go there,
it's a bad idea to go there and we need 

1192
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:51,370
to be grounded better.
And so hopefully.

1193
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,590
Well we'll see how this works.
Alright.

1194
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:57,490
So how do I approach this?
Well,

1195
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,010
first of all,
I think in evolutionary terms,

1196
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:05,490
as far as I'm concerned,
the cosmos is 15 billion years old and 

1197
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:10,051
the world is four and a half billion 
years old and there's been life for 

1198
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:10,420
three and a half billion years and there
were,

1199
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,190
you know,
there were,

1200
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:16,191
there were creatures that had pretty 
developed nervous systems 300 to 600 

1201
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:20,790
million years ago and we living in trees
as small mammals 60 million years ago 

1202
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:25,910
when we were down on the plains between 
$60 million and 7 million years ago.

1203
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:29,420
And that's about when we split from 
chimpanzees and modern human beings seem

1204
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:34,421
to emerge about 150,000
years ago and civilization pretty much 

1205
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:37,300
after the last ice age.
Something after 15,000

1206
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,130
years ago,
not very long ago at all.

1207
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,820
You know?
And that's the.

1208
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,960
That's the span across which I want to 
understand.

1209
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,080
That's the span across which I want to 
understand.

1210
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:52,081
I want to understand why we are the way 
we are looking at life and it's in its 

1211
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:55,240
continual complexity right from the 
beginning of life itself.

1212
01:05:55,241 --> 01:06:00,241
And there's some real utility in that 
because we share attributes with other 

1213
01:06:00,241 --> 01:06:00,241
animals,
even apple,

1214
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,280
apple animals,
as simple as crustaceans,

1215
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:08,281
for example,
have nervous system properties that are 

1216
01:06:08,281 --> 01:06:10,921
very much like ours.
And it's very much worth worth knowing 

1217
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:11,830
that.
So I think in an evolutionary way,

1218
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:16,831
I think it's a grand and remarkable way 
to think because it has this incredible 

1219
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:17,680
timespan,
right?

1220
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,090
It's this amazing.
I mean,

1221
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:24,091
people at the end of the 19th century,
middle of the 19th century say,

1222
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,060
thought the world really thought the 
world was about 6,000

1223
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:30,940
years old.
I mean 15 billion years old.

1224
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:32,080
That's a lot more,
right?

1225
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:33,970
It's a lot grander.
It's a lot bigger,

1226
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:38,020
but it's also a lot more frightening and
an alienating in some sense because,

1227
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,270
you know,
the cosmos has become so vast.

1228
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:45,271
It's either easy for human beings to 
think of themselves as trivial specs on 

1229
01:06:45,271 --> 01:06:49,501
a trivial spec out some misbegotten hell
hole end of the galaxy among hundreds of

1230
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,780
millions of galaxies,
right?

1231
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:57,781
It's,
it's very easy to see yourself as 

1232
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:58,480
nothing in that span of time.
That's a real challenge for people.

1233
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,690
And um,
I think it's a mistake to think that way

1234
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,380
because I think consciousness is far 
more than we think it is,

1235
01:07:05,381 --> 01:07:07,660
but it's still something we have to 
grapple with.

1236
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:14,730
I'm a psychoanalytic thinker,
and what that means is that I believe 

1237
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,780
that people are collections of 
subpersonalities.

1238
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,770
Those subpersonalities are alive.
They're not machines.

1239
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,170
They're there.
They have their viewpoint,

1240
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:25,900
they have their wants,
they have their perceptions,

1241
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:28,150
they have their arguments,
they have their emotions.

1242
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,510
They're like low resolution 
representations of you.

1243
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,500
You know,
when you get angry,

1244
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:35,710
it's like it's a very low resolution 
representation of you.

1245
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,510
It only wants rage or it only wants 
something to eat or when we want it,

1246
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,470
only wants water,
only wants sex.

1247
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:42,260
It's,
it's,

1248
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,810
it's you,
but shrunken,

1249
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,850
focused in a specific direction.
And,

1250
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,850
and,
and those,

1251
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,980
all those motivational systems are very,
very ancient,

1252
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,390
very archaic,
and very,

1253
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:57,391
very powerful.
And they blamed determining role in the 

1254
01:07:57,391 --> 01:08:00,130
manner in which we manifest ourselves.
As Freud pointed out with the Ed,

1255
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:05,110
we have to figure out how to take all 
those underlying animalistic motivations

1256
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:10,111
and emotions and civilize them in some 
way so that we can all live in the same 

1257
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,390
general territory without tearing each 
other to shreds,

1258
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,780
which is maybe the position of both 
chimpanzee and humanity.

1259
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,320
So,
so I take that seriously.

1260
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:24,450
The idea that we're a loose collection 
of spirits and that,

1261
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,500
that,
that,

1262
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,780
that no,
it says in the Old Testament somewhere 

1263
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,030
that the fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom and I think this is akin to that.

1264
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:37,031
If you know that you're not in control 
of yourself thoroughly and that there 

1265
01:08:37,031 --> 01:08:41,231
are other factors behind the scenes,
like the Greeks thought that human 

1266
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:43,530
beings were the play things of the gods 
outs,

1267
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,850
the way they conceptualize the world.
They sort of meant the same thing.

1268
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:50,900
They meant that there are these great 
forces that move us,

1269
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,480
that we don't create that were,
that were,

1270
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,300
that were subordinate to in some sense,
not entirely,

1271
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:59,150
but we can be subordinate to them and 
they move our destinies.

1272
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,520
That was the Greek view and there's 
something.

1273
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,070
It,
it,

1274
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:02,580
it,
it,

1275
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:07,590
it,
it teaches you humility to understand 

1276
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:07,590
that,
that,

1277
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,270
that there's a hell of a lot more going 
on behind the scenes and you're,

1278
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,570
you're the driver of a very complex 
vehicle,

1279
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:16,571
but you don't understand the vehicle 
very well and it's got its own 

1280
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:20,110
motivations and methods and sometimes 
you think it's doing something and it's 

1281
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,260
doing something completely,
completely different.

1282
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,190
You see that in psychotherapy all the 
time because you know you helped someone

1283
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:28,430
unwind a pattern of behavior that 
they've manifested forever.

1284
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:29,840
First of all,
they describe it.

1285
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:34,841
Then they become aware of it.
Then maybe they start to see what the 

1286
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,541
cause is.
They have no idea why they were acting 

1287
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:37,541
like that.
You know,

1288
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,400
they have to have the memory that 
produced the,

1289
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,480
the behavioral pattern to begin with.
It has to be brought back to mind and 

1290
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:48,041
then it has to be analyzed and assessed 
and then they have to think about a 

1291
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:49,490
different way of acting.
And it's extraordinarily complex.

1292
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,690
So

1293
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,310
psychoanalytic literary,
well

1294
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:03,010
there's this new,
there's this postmodern idea about 

1295
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,810
literature and about the world for that 
matter that if you take a complex piece 

1296
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:11,300
of literature like,
like a Shakespeare play,

1297
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,990
there's no end to the number of 
interpretations that you can make of it.

1298
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,390
You know,
you can eat turpin each word.

1299
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:19,370
You can interpret each phrase,
each sentence,

1300
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,190
each paragraph,
you can interpret the entire play.

1301
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,490
The way you interpreted depends on how 
many other books you've read,

1302
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,250
depends on your orientation in the 
world.

1303
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,430
It depends on a very,
very large number of things,

1304
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:34,760
how cultured you are or how how much 
culture you lack.

1305
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,580
All of those things.
That opens up a huge,

1306
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,860
a huge vista for potential 
interpretation and so the postmodern and

1307
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:43,550
sort of stubbed their toe on that 
thought,

1308
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:48,551
well,
if there's this vast number of 

1309
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:49,340
interpretations of any particular 
literary work,

1310
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:54,370
how can you be sure that any 
interpretation is more valid than any 

1311
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:54,370
other interpretation?

1312
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:58,810
And if you can't be sure,
then how do you even know those are 

1313
01:10:58,810 --> 01:10:58,810
great works.
How do you know they can't?

1314
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:03,400
Maybe they're just works that the people
in power have used to facilitate their 

1315
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:08,530
continual succession of power,
which is really a postmodern idea.

1316
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,980
Very,
very cynical one,

1317
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:14,981
but it has its point,
but the thing is it's grounded in 

1318
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:14,981
something real,
right?

1319
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:14,981
It's like,
yes,

1320
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:17,490
you can interpret things forever.
I want to show you something here.

1321
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,220
Just briefly.
We'll go back to it later.

1322
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,340
Look at this.
This is the cool one of the coolest 

1323
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,160
things I've ever seen.
So at the bottom here,

1324
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,100
every single one of those lines is a 
biblical verse.

1325
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,200
Okay?

1326
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:36,490
Now the length of the line is 
proportionate to how many times that 

1327
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,780
verse is referred to in some way by some
other verse.

1328
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,520
So you say,
well,

1329
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:45,670
this is the first hyperlinked book,
right?

1330
01:11:45,671 --> 01:11:47,860
I'm dead serious about that.
Like that.

1331
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,110
You can't click and get the hyperlinks 
obviously,

1332
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:52,450
but it's a thoroughly hyperlink book and
it's because,

1333
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:57,630
well,
the people who worked on these stories 

1334
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:57,630
that are hypothetically at the end,
right,

1335
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,110
which is the end,
can't affect the beginning.

1336
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,090
That's the rule of time,
right?

1337
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,300
What happens now can affect what 
happened to you 10 years ago.

1338
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,850
Even though it actually can,
but whatever.

1339
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:12,770
Well,
you reinterpret things right and then 

1340
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:12,770
they're not the same but like whatever,
we won't get into that,

1341
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,940
but technically speaking the president 
cannot affect the past,

1342
01:12:15,941 --> 01:12:20,110
but if we're looking at a piece of 
literature that's not right because when

1343
01:12:20,111 --> 01:12:25,111
you write the end,
you know what it was at the beginning 

1344
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:25,111
and when you write the beginning or edit
it,

1345
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:29,131
you know what's at the end so you can 
weave the whole thing together and 

1346
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:33,181
there's 65,000
cross-references and that's what this 

1347
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:36,510
map shows and so that's a great visual 
representation of the book and then you 

1348
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,420
can see,
well why is it deep?

1349
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:38,890
Why is the book deep?
Well,

1350
01:12:38,891 --> 01:12:41,560
just imagine how many pathways you can 
take through that,

1351
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:47,010
right?
I mean you'd just journey through your 

1352
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,010
journey through that forever.
You'd never ever get to the end of it.

1353
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:52,290
There's permutations and combinations 
and every phrase is dependent on every 

1354
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:54,010
other phrase in every versus dependent 
on every other doctor.

1355
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,260
Not entirely,
but 65,000

1356
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,840
is not a bad start and so.

1357
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,290
Okay,
well so,

1358
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:07,410
so the that that's another issue in some
sense that seems to make the 

1359
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,470
postmodernist critique even more.
Correct.

1360
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:13,471
How in the world you're going to extract
out a canonical interpretation of 

1361
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,350
something like that,
so like it's not possible,

1362
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,440
but here's the issue as far as I can 
tell,

1363
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:23,130
the interpreter.
So in the postmodernists extended that 

1364
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:23,130
critique to the world,
they said,

1365
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:23,950
look,
well a text is complicated enough.

1366
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:26,290
You can't extract out a canonical 
interpretation.

1367
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,920
What about the world?
The world is way more complicated than a

1368
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:34,921
text,
and so there's an infinite number of 

1369
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,841
ways that you can look at the world and 
so how do we know that any one way is 

1370
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:38,530
better than any other way?
And that's a good question.

1371
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:45,400
Now the postmodern answer was we can't,
and that's not a good answer because you

1372
01:13:45,401 --> 01:13:47,620
drowned in chaos under those 
circumstances,

1373
01:13:47,621 --> 01:13:52,621
right?
You can't make sense of anything and 

1374
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:52,621
that's not good because

1375
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,170
it's not neutral to not make sense of 
things.

1376
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:01,980
It's very anxiety provoking.
It's very depressing because if things 

1377
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,430
are so chaotic that you can't get a 
handle on them,

1378
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:08,610
your body defaults into emergency 
preparation mode and your heart rate 

1379
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,140
goes up and your immune system stops 
working and like you burn yourself,

1380
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:15,850
you age rapidly because you're 
surrounded by nothing you can control.

1381
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,190
It's varying.
That's an existential crisis,

1382
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:20,320
right?
It's anxiety provoking in depressing,

1383
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,080
very hard on people and even more than 
that,

1384
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,250
it turns out that the way that we're 
constructed neurophysiologically is that

1385
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:32,251
we don't experience any positive emotion
unless we have an aim and we can see 

1386
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:38,131
ourselves progressing towards that aim.
It isn't precisely attaining the aim 

1387
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,080
that makes us happy.
As you all know,

1388
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:43,900
if you've ever attained anything because
soon as you obtain it,

1389
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:49,290
then the whole little game ends,
then you have to come up with another 

1390
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:49,290
game,
right?

1391
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,340
So it's sisyphus and that's okay,
but,

1392
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:56,370
but it does show that the attainment 
can't be the thing that drives you 

1393
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:59,731
because it collapses the game.
That's what happens when you graduate 

1394
01:14:59,731 --> 01:15:02,701
from university.
It's like you're king of the mountain 

1395
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:03,370
for one day and then you're like surf at
at,

1396
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,010
at,
at starbucks for the next five years.

1397
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,550
So what happens is that that human 
beings are weird creatures because we're

1398
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:17,551
much more activated by having an aim and
moving towards it than we are by 

1399
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:22,531
attainment.
And what that means is you have to have 

1400
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:23,560
an aim and that means you have to have 
an interpretation and it also means that

1401
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,650
the nobler aim.
That's one way of thinking about it,

1402
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,980
the better your life.
And that's a really interesting thing to

1403
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:34,981
know because you know,
you've heard ever since you were tiny 

1404
01:15:34,981 --> 01:15:35,310
that you should act like a good person.
You shouldn't lie,

1405
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:36,550
for example,
and you might think,

1406
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:41,551
well,
why the hell should I act like a good 

1407
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:42,400
person?
Why not lie in even a three year old can

1408
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:47,401
ask that question because smart,
smart kids learn to lie earlier by the 

1409
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:47,440
way,
and they think,

1410
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:52,441
well,
why not twist the fabric of reality so 

1411
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:54,220
that it serves your specific short term 
needs?

1412
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,600
I mean,
that's a great question.

1413
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:57,640
Why not do that?
Why Act Morally?

1414
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:02,730
If you can get away with something and 
it brings you closer to something you 

1415
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,460
want,
well why not do it?

1416
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,280
These are good questions.
It's not self evident.

1417
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:11,610
Well,
it seems to be tied in with what I just 

1418
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:14,101
mentioned.
It's like your destabilize yourself and 

1419
01:16:14,101 --> 01:16:14,101
things become chaotic.
That's not good,

1420
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,060
and if you don't have a no blame,
then you have nothing but but shallow or

1421
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:24,270
trivial pleasures and they don't sustain
you and that's not good because because 

1422
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:27,370
life is so difficult,
so much,

1423
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,860
it's so much suffering.
It's so complex.

1424
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,740
It ends and everyone dies and it's 
painful.

1425
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,520
It's like without a no blame,
how can you withstand any of that?

1426
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,490
You can't.
You become desperate and once you become

1427
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:42,430
desperate things go.
Things go from bad to worse,

1428
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,600
very rapidly when you become desperate,
and so there's the idea of the noble aim

1429
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,380
and it's.

1430
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,230
It's not something.
It's something that's necessary.

1431
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,480
It's the bread that people cannot live 
without,

1432
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,010
right?
That's not physical bread.

1433
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:57,760
It's the noble aim and what is that?
Well,

1434
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,780
it was encapsulated in part in the story
of Marduk.

1435
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,040
That's,
that's to pay attention.

1436
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:05,830
It's to speak properly.
It's to confront chaos,

1437
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,620
it's to make a better world.
It's something like that,

1438
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:14,010
and that's enough of a no blame so that 
you can stand up without cringing at the

1439
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:19,090
very thought of your own existence so 
that you can do something that's 

1440
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,380
worthwhile to justify your wretched 
position on the planet.

1441
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:26,980
So now there's a literary issue.
Is that so look,

1442
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,680
you take a text,
you can interpret it a variety of ways,

1443
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:35,681
but that's not right.
This is where the postmodernist went 

1444
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:38,501
wrong because what you're looking for in
a text and in the world for that matter 

1445
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:42,860
is is sufficient order and direction,
so then we have to think,

1446
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:47,861
well,
what is sufficient order and direction 

1447
01:17:47,861 --> 01:17:49,901
means well,
you don't want to suffer so much that 

1448
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:49,901
your life is unbearable.

1449
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:51,200
Right?
That just seems self evident.

1450
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:56,410
Pain argues for itself,
I think of pain as the fundamental 

1451
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:59,210
reality because no one disputes it,
right?

1452
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:04,420
I mean,
even if you say that you don't believe 

1453
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:04,420
in pain,
it doesn't help when you're in pain,

1454
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:06,020
you still believe in it,
right?

1455
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:06,410
It's,
it's,

1456
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:11,411
it's.
You can't pry it up with logic and 

1457
01:18:11,411 --> 01:18:15,101
rationality,
it just stands forthe as as what the 

1458
01:18:15,101 --> 01:18:16,370
fundament of existence and that's 
actually quite useful to know.

1459
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,910
Say,
well,

1460
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:21,911
you don't want any more of that than is 
absolutely necessary and I think that's 

1461
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:22,940
self evident and then you say,
wait a minute.

1462
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:26,000
It's more complicated than that.
You don't want any more of that.

1463
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:29,710
That's necessary today,
but also not tomorrow and not next week,

1464
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,790
not next month,
not next year,

1465
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:36,850
so however you act now better not 
compromise how you're going to be in a 

1466
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,700
year because that would just be 
counterproductive.

1467
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,970
Now it's part of the problem with short 
term pleasures,

1468
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:43,490
right?
It's like active haste,

1469
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:46,280
repented leisure.
Everyone knows exactly what that means,

1470
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:51,281
so you have to act in a way that works 
now and tomorrow and next week and next 

1471
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:53,330
month and so forth,
and so you have to take your future self

1472
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:58,331
into account and human beings can do 
that and taking your future self into 

1473
01:18:58,331 --> 01:19:01,100
account isn't much different than taking
other people into account.

1474
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:06,550
Right?
Because I remember there's this Simpson 

1475
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,311
episode and a homer downs,
a quart of Manet's and vodka.

1476
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,580
He says,
someone's marge says,

1477
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:17,840
you know,
you shouldn't really do that,

1478
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:20,600
and homer says that's a problem for 
future homer.

1479
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:22,670
I share.
I'm sure glad I'm not.

1480
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:27,671
That guy had so ridiculous.
They called Rico,

1481
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,910
you know,
but but okay,

1482
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:36,911
but you see we have to grapple with that
and so the you that's out there in the 

1483
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:40,451
future is sort of like another person.
And so figuring out how to conduct 

1484
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:44,681
yourself properly in relationship to 
your future self isn't much different 

1485
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:48,610
than figuring out how to conduct 
yourself in relationship to other 

1486
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,281
people,
but then we could expand the 

1487
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:53,231
constraints.
Not only does the interpretation that 

1488
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:55,490
you extract have to protect you from 
suffering and give you an Ame,

1489
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,860
but it has to do it in a way that's 
iterable.

1490
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:03,430
So it works across time and then it has 
to work in the presence of other people 

1491
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:07,870
so that you can cooperate with them and 
compete with them in a way that doesn't 

1492
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:07,870
make you suffer more.

1493
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,980
And people are there.
They're not that tolerant.

1494
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,290
You know what I mean?
They have choices.

1495
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:18,291
They don't have to hang around with you.
They can hang around with any one of 

1496
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:18,510
these other primates,
and so if you don't act properly,

1497
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:23,570
at least within certain boundaries,
it's like you're just cast aside and so 

1498
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:28,581
people are broadcasting information at 
you all the time about how you need to 

1499
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:32,451
interpret the world so they can tolerate
being around you and you need that 

1500
01:20:32,451 --> 01:20:34,620
because socially isolated,
you're insane and then your dad,

1501
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,890
no one can tolerate being alone for any 
length of time.

1502
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:43,220
We can't maintain our own sanity without
continual feedback from other people 

1503
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,571
because it's too damn complicated.
So you're constrained by your own 

1504
01:20:47,571 --> 01:20:51,411
existence and then you're constrained by
the existence of other people and then 

1505
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:52,110
you're also constrained by the world.
You know,

1506
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:57,111
if I read hamlet and what I extract out 
of that is the idea that I should jump 

1507
01:20:57,111 --> 01:20:57,780
off a bridge.

1508
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:02,990
It's like it's.
It puts my interpretation to an end 

1509
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:06,711
retailer rather quickly.
It doesn't seem to be optimally 

1510
01:21:06,711 --> 01:21:06,711
functional,
let's say,

1511
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:11,580
and so an interpretation has is 
constrained by the reality of the world.

1512
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:16,581
It's constrained by the reality of other
people and is constrained by your 

1513
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:19,680
reality across time and there's only a 
small number of interpretations that are

1514
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:22,740
going to work in that tightly defined 
space,

1515
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:26,580
and so that's part of the reason that 
the postmodernists are wrong.

1516
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:31,940
It's also part of the reason by the way 
that ai people who've been trying to 

1517
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,211
make intelligent machines had had to put
them in a body is it turns out that you 

1518
01:21:35,211 --> 01:21:36,480
just can't make something intelligent in
some sense,

1519
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:41,481
without it being embodied,
and it's partly for the reasons that I 

1520
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:44,451
just described as you need constraints 
on the system before you need 

1521
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:50,121
constraints on the system so that the 
system doesn't drown in an infinite sea 

1522
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:50,280
of interpretation.

1523
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:54,020
It's something like that.
So that's the literary end of it.

1524
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:59,210
Moral while morality for me is about 
action and I'm an existentialist in some

1525
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:05,211
sense,
and what that means is that I believe 

1526
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:05,910
that what people believe to be true is 
what they act out,

1527
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:10,911
not what they say,
and so there's lots of definitions of 

1528
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:10,911
truth.
I mean,

1529
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:13,350
truth is a very expansive word and you 
can think of objective truth,

1530
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:17,400
but behavioral truth isn't the same as 
objective truth.

1531
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:21,750
What you should do isn't the same as 
what is as far as I can tell,

1532
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:26,751
people debate that,
but I think the reason that that has to 

1533
01:22:26,751 --> 01:22:27,720
be the case is because think about it 
this way.

1534
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,860
You're standing in front of a field and 
you can see the field,

1535
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,770
but the field doesn't tell you how to 
walk through it.

1536
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:40,250
There's an infinite number of ways you 
could walk through it and so you can 

1537
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,161
extract out an inviolable guide to how 
you should act from the array of facts 

1538
01:22:44,731 --> 01:22:49,731
that are in front of you because there's
just too many facts and they don't have 

1539
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,330
directionality and but you,
you need to know.

1540
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:55,590
You need to know how not to suffer and 
you need to know what your aim is,

1541
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,610
and so you have to overlay that 
objective reality with some interpretive

1542
01:22:59,611 --> 01:23:04,611
structure and it's the nature of that 
interpretive structure that we're going 

1543
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:04,611
to be aiming at.
Heart.

1544
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:09,181
I've given you hints about it already.
We've extracted it in part from 

1545
01:23:09,181 --> 01:23:12,991
observations of our own behavior and 
other people's behavior and we've 

1546
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:16,501
extracted in part by the nature of our 
embodiment that's been shaped over 

1547
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:20,880
hundreds of millions of years,
but we see the infinite plane of facts 

1548
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,591
and we impose a moral interpretation on 
it and the moral interpretation is what 

1549
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:30,991
to do about what is and that's 
associated both with security because 

1550
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:36,061
you just don't need too much complexity 
and also with aim and so we're mobile 

1551
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:36,070
creatures,
right?

1552
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:41,071
We need to know where we're going 
because all were ever concerned about 

1553
01:23:41,071 --> 01:23:42,670
roughly speaking is where we're going.

1554
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,220
That's what we need to know.
Where are we going,

1555
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,510
what are we doing,
and why?

1556
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,220
And that's not the same question as what
is the world made of objectively,

1557
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,920
it's a different question,
requires different answers,

1558
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:57,460
and so that's the domain of the moral as
far as I'm concerned,

1559
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,190
which is what are you aiming at?
What?

1560
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,890
And that's the question of the ultimate 
ideal in some sense.

1561
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:06,250
Even if you have trivial little 
fragmentary ideals,

1562
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:11,430
there's there's something trying to 
emerge out of that that's it's more 

1563
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:15,490
coherent and more integrated and more 
applicable and more practical.

1564
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,960
And that's the other thing is that you 
know,

1565
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:24,420
you think about literature and you think
about art and you think those aren't 

1566
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,031
very tightly tied to the earth.
They're imperial in area and spiritual 

1567
01:24:27,031 --> 01:24:31,861
and they don't seem practical,
but I'm a practical person and part of 

1568
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:37,021
the reason that I wanted to assess these
books from a literary and aesthetic and 

1569
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:40,690
evolutionary perspective is to extract 
out something of value.

1570
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,630
Something of real value that's 
practical.

1571
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:48,930
You know,
something because one of the rules that 

1572
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,470
I have when I'm lecturing is that I 
don't want to tell anybody anything that

1573
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:53,770
they can't use because I think of 
knowledge as a tool.

1574
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,890
It states something to implement in the 
world where tool,

1575
01:24:56,891 --> 01:25:01,891
using creatures and our knowledges,
tools and we need tools to work in the 

1576
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:06,151
world.
We need tools to regulate our emotions 

1577
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:08,221
and to make things better and to put an 
end to suffering to the degree that we 

1578
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:11,911
can and to live with ourselves properly 
and to stand up properly and you need 

1579
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:17,041
the tools to do that.
And so I don't want to do anything in 

1580
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,280
this lecture series that isn't 
practical.

1581
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,680
No.
I want you to come away having things 

1582
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,520
put together in a way that you can 
immediately apply,

1583
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,750
not interested in abstraction for the 
sake of abstraction.

1584
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,030
Rational.
Well,

1585
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,680
it's gotTa make sense?
You know,

1586
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,040
because the more restrictions on your 
theory the better.

1587
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:40,430
And so

1588
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:47,540
I want it all laid out causally so that 
a and a fall or be follows a and b 

1589
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:53,740
proceeds and in a way that's 
understandable and doesn't require a 

1590
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,520
leap.
Any unnecessary leap of faith,

1591
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:01,620
you know,
because that's another thing that I 

1592
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,931
think interferes with our relationship 
with a collection of books like the 

1593
01:26:02,931 --> 01:26:07,310
Bible is that you're called upon to 
believe things that no one can believe.

1594
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,700
And that's no good because that's a form
of lie as far as I can tell.

1595
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:15,701
And then,
well then you have to scrap the whole 

1596
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:17,561
thing because in principle the whole 
thing is about truth and if you have to 

1597
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:18,380
start your pursuit of truth by 
swallowing a bunch of lies,

1598
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,810
then how in the world are you going to 
get anywhere with that?

1599
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:25,640
And so I don't want any uncertainty at 
the bottom of this.

1600
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:27,940
Her,
I don't want any more than that.

1601
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,520
I have to leave in it because I can't 
get any farther than that.

1602
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,890
And so we,
it's gonna make sense?

1603
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:38,600
Rationally I want it.
I don't want it to be pushing up against

1604
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,300
what we know to be scientifically 
untrue,

1605
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:43,340
even though science is in flux and 
that's,

1606
01:26:43,341 --> 01:26:48,341
you know,
somewhat of a dangerous parameter I 

1607
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:51,151
don't want.
If it isn't working with evolutionary 

1608
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:51,151
theory,
for example,

1609
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:52,430
then I think that it's not a good enough
solution.

1610
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:53,690
So.

1611
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,420
And then finally it's phenomenal.
Logical,

1612
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:00,970
modern people.

1613
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:02,990
No,
we think of the,

1614
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:07,280
of reality as objective and that's very 
powerful.

1615
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,100
But that isn't how we experience 
reality.

1616
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,770
We have our domain of experience,
you know,

1617
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:19,170
and it's a hard thing to get a grip on 
even though it should be the most 

1618
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:23,681
obvious thing for the phenomenologists.
Everything that you experienced is real 

1619
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,890
and so they're interested in the 
structure of your subjective experience.

1620
01:27:27,891 --> 01:27:28,460
I can say,
well,

1621
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:31,210
you have subjective experience and you 
have subjective experiences,

1622
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:36,230
so to you,
and there's commonalities across all of 

1623
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:36,230
those.
Like for example,

1624
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:38,300
you're.
You're likely to experience the same set

1625
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,390
of emotions.
You know,

1626
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:43,620
we've been able to identify canonical 
emotions and canonical motivations,

1627
01:27:43,621 --> 01:27:48,621
and without that we couldn't even 
communicate because you wouldn't know 

1628
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:49,700
what the other person was like.
You'd have to explain infinitely.

1629
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,560
There's nothing you can take for 
granted,

1630
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:56,561
but you can.
You know when phenomenology is the fact 

1631
01:27:56,561 --> 01:27:59,501
that in the center of my vision,
my hands are very clear and then out in 

1632
01:27:59,501 --> 01:27:59,960
the periphery they get they disappear.

1633
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,200
And phenomenology is the way things 
smell and the way things taste and the 

1634
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,681
fact that they matter.
And so you could say in some sense that 

1635
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:12,340
phenomenology is the study of what 
matters rather than matter.

1636
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:18,770
And it's a given from the phenomenal 
logical perspective that things have 

1637
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:20,570
meaning and that did any,
you know,

1638
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:24,800
even if you're a rationalist saying 
cynic and denialist and you say,

1639
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,180
well,
nothing has any meaning.

1640
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:31,390
You still run into the problem of pain 
because pain undercuts your arguments 

1641
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,180
and has a meaning.
So there's no escaping from the meaning.

1642
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:37,820
You can pretty much demolished all the 
positive parts of it,

1643
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,880
but trying to think your way out of the 
negative parts.

1644
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:45,881
Man,
good luck with that because that just 

1645
01:28:45,881 --> 01:28:47,621
doesn't work.
So phenomenology is now the Bible 

1646
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,610
stories,
and I think this is true.

1647
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,420
A fiction in general is phenomenal 
logical and

1648
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:01,060
it concentrates on trying to elucidate 
the nature of human experience and that 

1649
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:04,560
is not the as the objective world,
but it's also a form of truth because it

1650
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:08,670
is true that you have a field of 
experience and that it has qualities.

1651
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:11,490
The question is what are the qualities?
Now?

1652
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:16,550
Ancient representations of reality.
We're sort of a weird meld of observable

1653
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:21,591
phenomena.
Things that we would consider objective 

1654
01:29:21,591 --> 01:29:23,580
facts and subjective truth,
the projection of subjective truth.

1655
01:29:23,581 --> 01:29:25,350
And I'll show you,
for example,

1656
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,330
I'll show you how the Mesopotamians 
viewed the world and they had a.

1657
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,500
They had a model.
Basically the world was a disc.

1658
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:35,970
You know,
if you go out into field at night,

1659
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,860
what does the world look like?
Well,

1660
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:40,800
it's a disc.
It's got a dome on top of it.

1661
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,530
Well,
that was basically the Mesopotamian view

1662
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:48,531
of the world view of the world that the 
people who wrote the first stories in 

1663
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:49,590
the Bible believe too,
and an eye on top of the dome.

1664
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:52,170
There was water.
While obviously it's like a range,

1665
01:29:52,171 --> 01:29:53,640
right?
Where does the water come from?

1666
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:58,880
Well,
there's water around the dome and then 

1667
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,910
there's land that's the disk.
And then underneath that there's water.

1668
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,280
How do you know that?
Well drill.

1669
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,750
You'll hit water.
Well,

1670
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:08,751
it's under the earth obviously,
because otherwise how would you hit the 

1671
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:08,751
water and then what's under that?
This freshwater.

1672
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:09,990
And then what's under that?
Well,

1673
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,360
if you go to the edge of the disc,
he hit the ocean.

1674
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,600
It's sold water.
So it's a dome with water outside of it.

1675
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:20,880
And then it's a desk that the dome sits 
on.

1676
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,860
And then underneath that there's fresh 
water,

1677
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:27,861
and then underneath that there's sold 
water and that was roughly the 

1678
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:27,861
Mesopotamian world.
And you see,

1679
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:31,980
you see that's a mix of observation and 
imagination,

1680
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,990
right?
Because that isn't the world,

1681
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:36,570
but it is the way the world appears.

1682
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:41,990
It's a perfectly believable cosmology 
from and the sunrises and sunsets on 

1683
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:48,621
that dome.
It's not like the thing is bloody well 

1684
01:30:48,621 --> 01:30:48,621
spinning.
Who would ever think that out?

1685
01:30:48,621 --> 01:30:51,480
It's obviously the sun comes up,
it goes down and then travels underneath

1686
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:56,510
the world and comes back up again.
There's nothing more self evident than 

1687
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:56,940
that.
Well that's,

1688
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:00,930
that's that strange intermingling of 
subjective fantasy,

1689
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:05,931
let's say right at the level of 
perception and actual observable 

1690
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:09,291
phenomena.
And a lot of the cosmology that's 

1691
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:10,020
associated with the biblical stories is 
exactly like that.

1692
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:14,970
It's half psychology in half and half 
and half reality.

1693
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,520
Although the psychological is real as 
well.

1694
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,770
So,
so that an end to know that the biblical

1695
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:25,710
stories have a phenomenal logical truth 
is really worth knowing.

1696
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:29,520
Because you know,
the poor fundamentalists,

1697
01:31:29,521 --> 01:31:32,930
they're trying to claim to their moral 
structure and you know,

1698
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:37,940
I understand why because it does 
organize their societies and organizes 

1699
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,390
their psyche so they've got something to
cling to,

1700
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:44,391
but you know,
they don't have a very sophisticated 

1701
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:47,481
idea of the complexity of what 
constitutes truth and they try to 

1702
01:31:47,481 --> 01:31:51,540
Gerrymander the biblical stories into 
the domain of scientific theory.

1703
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:52,880
You know,
creating,

1704
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,070
promoting creationism,
for example,

1705
01:31:56,071 --> 01:31:58,430
has an alternative scientific theory.
It's like this,

1706
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,700
just that just isn't gonna go anywhere,
you know,

1707
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:05,940
because the people who wrote these damn 
stories weren't scientists to begin 

1708
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,060
with.
There weren't any scientists back then.

1709
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,030
There's hardly any scientists now.
You know,

1710
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,080
it's,
it's really,

1711
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:12,940
it's hard to think scientifically,
man.

1712
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:17,941
It's like,
it takes a lot of training and even 

1713
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:20,131
scientists don't think scientifically 
once you get the boat of the lab and 

1714
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:20,590
hardly even when they're in the lab,
you know,

1715
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:25,591
you've got to get peer reviewed and 
criticized and it gets hard to think 

1716
01:32:25,591 --> 01:32:26,290
scientifically.
So in however,

1717
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:29,290
the people who wrote these stories 
thought it was more like dramatists,

1718
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:34,291
think more like Shakespeare thought,
but that doesn't mean that there isn't 

1719
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:37,860
truth in it,
it just means that you have to be a 

1720
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,590
little bit more sophisticated about your
ideas of truth and that's okay.

1721
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:41,320
You know,
there are truth to live by,

1722
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:43,060
okay,
well fine.

1723
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:48,061
Then we want to figure out what those 
are because we need to live then maybe 

1724
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:48,061
not to suffer so much.
So,

1725
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:49,540
so,
and so.

1726
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:54,541
If you know that what the Bible stories 
and stories in general are trying to 

1727
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:57,700
represent is the lived experience of 
conscious individuals,

1728
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,300
like the structure of the lived 
experience of conscious individuals,

1729
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:06,020
then that opens up the possibility of a 
whole different realm of understanding,

1730
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:11,020
eliminates the contradiction that's been
painful for people between the objective

1731
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:16,021
world and,
and let's say the claims of religious 

1732
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:16,021
stories.
So,

1733
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:16,870
okay,
okay.

1734
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:17,890
So let's,
let's,

1735
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:20,290
let's take a look at the structure of 
the book itself.

1736
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:25,710
So the first thing about the Bible is 
that it's a comedy and a comedy has a 

1737
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:26,620
happy ending,
right?

1738
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:31,621
So that's a strange thing because the 
Greek God stories were almost always 

1739
01:33:31,621 --> 01:33:31,621
tragic.

1740
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,960
Now the Bible is a comedy.
It has a happy ending.

1741
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:36,820
Everyone lives.
There's a habit.

1742
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:41,110
So now what you think about that as a 
completely different issue.

1743
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:43,060
I'm just telling you the structure of 
the story.

1744
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:48,061
It's something like there was paradise 
at the beginning of time and then some 

1745
01:33:48,061 --> 01:33:52,231
cataclysmic occurred and people fell 
into history and history is limitation 

1746
01:33:52,231 --> 01:33:54,070
and mortality and suffering and self 
consciousness,

1747
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,340
but there's a mode of being or 
potentially the establishment of the 

1748
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,170
state that will transcend that and 
that's what time is aiming at.

1749
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:04,870
So that's the.
That's the idea of the story.

1750
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,900
You know,
it's a funny thing that the Bible has 

1751
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,630
this story because it wasn't written as 
a book,

1752
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:15,690
right?
It was assembled from a whole bunch of 

1753
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,881
different books and the fact that it got
assembled into something resembling a 

1754
01:34:17,881 --> 01:34:19,060
story is quite remarkable.

1755
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,960
And what the question is then,
well,

1756
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:26,620
what is that story about and,
and how did it come up as a story?

1757
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,750
And then I suppose as well,
is there anything to it?

1758
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:34,110
It constitutes a dramatic record of self
realization or obstruction already 

1759
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:36,070
mentioned.
That is like the idea,

1760
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:38,590
for example,
of the formulation of the,

1761
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:41,380
let's say the image of God is an 
abstraction.

1762
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:43,000
That's how we're gonna handle it.
To begin with.

1763
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,600
I want to say though,
because I said I wasn't going to be any 

1764
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,481
more reductionist than necessary.
I know that the evidence for genuine 

1765
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:56,200
religious experience is 
incontrovertible,

1766
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,080
but it's not explicable and so I don't 
want to explain it away.

1767
01:35:00,081 --> 01:35:05,081
I want to just leave it as a fact and 
then I want to pull back from that and 

1768
01:35:05,081 --> 01:35:05,081
say,
okay,

1769
01:35:05,081 --> 01:35:08,540
well we'll leave that as a fact and the 
mystery and what we'll look at this.

1770
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,600
We're going to look at this from a 
rational perspective and say that the 

1771
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,400
initial formulation of the idea of God 
was an attempt to abstract out the ideal

1772
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:21,590
and to do consider it as a abstraction 
outside its instantiation,

1773
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:23,960
so and that's good enough.
That's amazing.

1774
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:25,730
That's an amazing thing.
If it's true,

1775
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,850
but I don't want to

1776
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,480
throw out the baby with the bath water.
Let's say it's a collection of books 

1777
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,190
with multiple redactors and editors.
So what does that mean?

1778
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:40,320
Many people wrote it.
There's many different books even and 

1779
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,401
they're interwoven together,
especially in the first five books by 

1780
01:35:44,401 --> 01:35:47,881
people who I suspect took the traditions
of tribes that had been brought together

1781
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:56,340
under a single political organization 
and tried to make their accounts 

1782
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:00,721
coherent and so it took a little of this
and they took a little of that and they 

1783
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:05,281
took a little of this and they and they 
tried not to lose anything because it 

1784
01:36:05,281 --> 01:36:07,120
seemed valuable or it was certainly 
valuable to the people who had collected

1785
01:36:07,121 --> 01:36:08,150
the stories.
They weren't gonna,

1786
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:11,350
you know,
tolerate too much editing,

1787
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:14,230
but they also wanted it to make sense to
some degree.

1788
01:36:14,231 --> 01:36:17,410
So it wasn't completely logically 
contradictory and,

1789
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:18,400
and,
and,

1790
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:23,490
and completely absurd and so many people
wrote it and many people edited and many

1791
01:36:25,031 --> 01:36:28,180
people assembled it over a vast stretch 
of time.

1792
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,700
And we have very few documents like 
that.

1793
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:35,701
And so just because we have a document 
like that is sufficient reason to to 

1794
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:41,090
look at it as a remarkable phenomena and
try to understand what it is that it's 

1795
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:42,550
trying to communicate,
let's say.

1796
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,670
And then I said it's also the world's 
first hyperlink text,

1797
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,610
which is,
which is that again,

1798
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:50,140
very much we're thinking about for quite
a long time.

1799
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,920
All right.
There's four sources

1800
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:59,850
in the old testament or the Hebrew Bible
for stories that we know came together.

1801
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:02,880
One was called the priestly.
There's a source called the priestly,

1802
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:08,030
and he used the name below him or El 
Shaddai for God and I believe Al is the 

1803
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,400
root word for Ela as well,
so and that's usually translated as God 

1804
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:19,161
or gods because below him is is utilized
as plural in the beginning books of the 

1805
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:23,940
Bible and it's newer than a yard was 
version.

1806
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:27,450
Now the reason I'm telling you that is 
because genesis one,

1807
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:30,420
which is the first story,
isn't as old as genesis two.

1808
01:37:30,421 --> 01:37:33,440
Genesis contains the yard,
was fruit,

1809
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,100
contains the story,
for example,

1810
01:37:35,101 --> 01:37:40,101
of Adam and eve,
and that's older than the very first 

1811
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:42,921
book in the Bible,
but they decided to put a newer version 

1812
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:46,251
first and what isn't,
and I think it's because it deals with 

1813
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:46,680
more fundamental abstractions.

1814
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:51,680
It's something like that.
It's like it deals with the most basic 

1815
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,201
of abstractions,
how the universe was created and then 

1816
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:57,980
segues into what the human is like.
And so that seems to be the logic behind

1817
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:02,820
it.
The yard was version uses the name,

1818
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,320
why h,
two h,

1819
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:07,290
which apparently people didn't say,
but we believe was pronounced,

1820
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:08,990
something like Yahuah,
um,

1821
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:13,170
and it,
it has a strongly anthropomorphic God.

1822
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:16,500
So one that takes human form.
It begins with genesis two,

1823
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:21,501
four.
This is the account of the heavens and 

1824
01:38:21,501 --> 01:38:23,661
the earth.
Wind and contains the story of Adam and 

1825
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:26,301
Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the 
Tower of Babel in exodus and numbers 

1826
01:38:26,301 --> 01:38:29,990
alone with priestly version.
It also contains the law in the form,

1827
01:38:29,991 --> 01:38:34,310
just the form of the 10 commandments,
which is like a truncated form of the,

1828
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,210
of the law.
There's

1829
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:37,810
the

1830
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:43,390
Elo has a source,
it contains the stories of Abraham and 

1831
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:45,470
Isaac it.
It's concerned with a heavenly hierarchy

1832
01:38:45,471 --> 01:38:48,680
that includes angels.
It talks about the departure from Egypt,

1833
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:52,140
and it presents the Covenant Code,
which is this idea of,

1834
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,140
you know,
that society is predicated.

1835
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,440
This was Israeli society.
It was predicated on a covenant with God

1836
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:59,660
and that's laid out in a sequence of 
rules,

1837
01:38:59,661 --> 01:39:04,661
some of which are the 10 commandments,
but many of which are much more 

1838
01:39:04,661 --> 01:39:07,841
extensive than that.
And then the final one is the 

1839
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:10,751
deuteronomistic code and it contains the
bulk of the law and the what's called 

1840
01:39:10,881 --> 01:39:14,090
the Deuterenomic history and it's 
independent of Genesis,

1841
01:39:14,091 --> 01:39:15,320
exodus,
leviticus,

1842
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:20,490
and numbers.
And so we know that at least for now 

1843
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,620
there's debate about this.
Like there is about everything you know,

1844
01:39:21,621 --> 01:39:24,650
so I'm brushing over a very large area 
of scholarship,

1845
01:39:24,651 --> 01:39:29,651
but people generally assume that there 
were multiple authors over multiple 

1846
01:39:29,721 --> 01:39:32,450
periods of time.
And the way they've concluded that is by

1847
01:39:32,451 --> 01:39:34,390
looking at textual analysis.
You know,

1848
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:39,700
trying to see where there are chunks of 
the stories that have the same kind of 

1849
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:43,991
style or the same reference.
People argue about that because you 

1850
01:39:43,991 --> 01:39:47,951
know,
obviously it's difficult to recreate 

1851
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:47,951
something ancient,
but that's,

1852
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:52,690
that's the basic idea.
So it is an amalgam of viewpoints about 

1853
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:55,370
these initial issues and,
and that's important to know.

1854
01:39:55,490 --> 01:40:00,020
So it's like a collective.
It's a collective story and uh,

1855
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:06,880
okay.
Now to understand the first part of 

1856
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,641
Genesis,
I'm going to turn strangely enough to

1857
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:18,780
something that's actually part of the 
New Testament and this is a central 

1858
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:22,560
element of Christianity and it's a very 
strange idea and it's going to take a 

1859
01:40:22,631 --> 01:40:25,570
very long time to unpack,
but the idea,

1860
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:30,010
this is what John said about Christ,
he said in the beginning was the word.

1861
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:35,100
And so that relates back to genesis one.
In the beginning was the word and the 

1862
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,870
word was with God and the word was gone.
Have some.

1863
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:39,530
Well,
you know,

1864
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,430
three sentences like that take a lot of 
unpacking because,

1865
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:47,630
well,
none of that seems to make any sense 

1866
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:47,630
whatsoever.
Really.

1867
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:50,340
Right.
In the beginning was the word and the 

1868
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,801
word was with God and the word was God.
So the first question might be what in 

1869
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:57,901
the does that mean in the beginning was 
the word that's the logos actually on 

1870
01:40:58,271 --> 01:41:00,640
the logos is embodied in the figure of 
Christ.

1871
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:03,430
So there's this idea in John,
whatever Christ is,

1872
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:07,000
the son of God is not only instantiated 
in history,

1873
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:11,200
say at a particular time and place as a,
as a carpenter in some backwoods part of

1874
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:16,201
the world,
but also something eternal that exists 

1875
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:19,890
outside of time and space that was there
right at the beginning and as far as I 

1876
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:21,280
can tell what that logo represents.

1877
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:26,280
It's something like modern people.
It's something like what modern people 

1878
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,190
refer to when they talk about 
consciousness.

1879
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,350
It's something like that.
It's more than that.

1880
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:34,351
It's like consciousness and its capacity
to to be aware and its capacity to 

1881
01:41:34,351 --> 01:41:39,271
communicate if something like that.
And there's an ID underneath that which 

1882
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:41,350
is that being especially from a 
phenomenal logical perspective.

1883
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:45,280
So the being that is experienced cannot 
exist without consciousness.

1884
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:50,410
It's like consciousness shines a light 
on things to bring it into being because

1885
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:54,910
without consciousness,
what is there no one experiences.

1886
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:59,911
Anything is like is there a.
is there anything when no one 

1887
01:41:59,911 --> 01:42:03,211
experiences anything?
That's the question and the answer that 

1888
01:42:03,211 --> 01:42:05,740
this book is presenting is that no,
you have to think about consciousness as

1889
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:11,100
a constituent element of reality.
It's something that's necessary for 

1890
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,700
reality.
It extends itself to exist.

1891
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,550
Now of course it depends on what you 
mean by reality,

1892
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,640
but the reality that's being referred to
here,

1893
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:22,470
I told you already is this strange 
amalgam of the subjective experience and

1894
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,910
the world,
but the question is deeper than that too

1895
01:42:24,911 --> 01:42:28,480
because it is by no means obvious what 
there is.

1896
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:33,570
If there's no one to experience it.
I mean the whole notion of time itself 

1897
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:37,771
seems to collapse at least in terms of 
something like felt duration and then 

1898
01:42:37,771 --> 01:42:42,420
the notion of size disappears 
essentially because there's nothing to 

1899
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,651
scale it and the causality seems to 
vanish and so and and we don't 

1900
01:42:47,471 --> 01:42:50,080
understand consciousness.
Not In the least.

1901
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:53,200
We don't understand what it is that is 
in us.

1902
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:57,580
That gives illumination to be.
And what happens in the Old Testament,

1903
01:42:57,581 --> 01:43:00,790
at least in part,
is that that consciousness is associated

1904
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:03,310
with the divine.
Now you think,

1905
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:08,550
well,
is that a reasonable proposition and 

1906
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:12,361
that's a very complicated question,
but at least we might know that there's 

1907
01:43:12,361 --> 01:43:15,870
something to the claim because there is 
a miracle of experience and existence 

1908
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:21,781
that's dependent on consciousness.
I mean people try to explain it away 

1909
01:43:21,781 --> 01:43:25,050
constantly,
but it doesn't seem to work very well 

1910
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:25,050
and here's something else to think 
about.

1911
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:26,560
I think it's really worth thinking 
about.

1912
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:30,130
People do not like it when you treat 
them like they're not conscious,

1913
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:35,940
right?
They react very badly to that and then 

1914
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:39,540
you don't like it.
If someone assumes that you're not 

1915
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,671
conscious and you don't like it,
if someone assumes that you don't have 

1916
01:43:41,671 --> 01:43:44,470
freewill,
you know that you're just absolutely 

1917
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,191
determined in your,
in your actions and there's nothing 

1918
01:43:47,191 --> 01:43:50,371
that's going to repair you and that you 
don't need to have any responsibility 

1919
01:43:50,371 --> 01:43:51,190
for your actions.
It's like our culture,

1920
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,020
the laws of our culture are predicated 
on the idea.

1921
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:59,170
Something like people are conscious,
people have experienced people make 

1922
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:00,890
decisions and can be held responsible 
for them.

1923
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:06,040
That there's a freewill element to it 
and you can debate all that 

1924
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:09,611
philosophically and fine,
but the point is is that that is how we 

1925
01:44:09,611 --> 01:44:13,631
act and that is the idea that our legal 
system is predicated on and there's 

1926
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:17,861
something deep about it because you know
you're subject to the law,

1927
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:24,010
but the law is also limited by you,
which is to say that in a well 

1928
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:28,070
functioning,
properly grounded democratic system,

1929
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,670
you have intrinsic value.

1930
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,750
That's the source of your rights.
Even if you're a murderer,

1931
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:41,080
we have to say the law can only go so 
far because there's something about you 

1932
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,200
that's divine.
Well.

1933
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:43,370
What does that mean?
Well,

1934
01:44:43,371 --> 01:44:48,371
partly it means that there's something 
about you that's conscious and capable 

1935
01:44:48,371 --> 01:44:51,941
of communicating like your whole world 
and unto yourself and you have that to 

1936
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:56,381
contribute to everyone else,
and that's valuable mean that you can 

1937
01:44:56,381 --> 01:45:00,191
learn new things.
You can transform the structure of 

1938
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:00,191
society.
You can invent a new way of dealing with

1939
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:02,110
the world.
You're capable of old,

1940
01:45:02,111 --> 01:45:05,810
that it's an intrinsic part of you and 
that's associated with this.

1941
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,800
It's associated.
That's the idea there is that there's 

1942
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,710
something about the logos that is 
necessary for the absolute chaos of the 

1943
01:45:17,241 --> 01:45:21,020
reality beyond experience to manifest 
itself as reality.

1944
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:26,590
It's an amazing idea because it gives 
consciousness a constitute of role in 

1945
01:45:26,661 --> 01:45:30,020
the cosmos and you can debate that,
but you know it's not.

1946
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:34,490
You can't just bloody well brush it off 
because first of all,

1947
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:38,000
we are the most complicated things there
are that we know of by,

1948
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:39,440
by a massive,
by,

1949
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,010
by a massive amount were so complicated 
that it's unbelievable.

1950
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:44,570
And so,
you know,

1951
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:48,410
there's a lot of cosmos out there,
but there's a lot of cosmos in here too.

1952
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:52,910
And which one is greater is by no means 
obvious unless you use something trivial

1953
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:57,911
like relative size,
which you know really isn't a very 

1954
01:45:57,911 --> 01:46:00,521
sophisticated approach and whatever it 
is that is you has this capacity to 

1955
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:05,000
experience reality and to transform it,
which is very strange thing.

1956
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:10,001
You know,
you can conceptualize a future in your 

1957
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:11,720
imagination and then you can work and 
make that manifest.

1958
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:14,420
You participate in the process of 
creation.

1959
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:19,570
That's one way of thinking about it.
And so that's why I think in genesis 

1960
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:20,190
one,
it re,

1961
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:25,550
it relates to the idea that human beings
are made in the image of the divine men 

1962
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:26,450
and women,
which is interesting too,

1963
01:46:26,451 --> 01:46:31,451
because you know,
the feminists are always criticizing 

1964
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:31,880
Christianity,
for example,

1965
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:36,881
as being what inexorably patriarchal or 
as they criticize everything like that.

1966
01:46:38,361 --> 01:46:39,770
So it's,
it's hardly a stroke,

1967
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:44,771
a bloody brilliance.
But I think it's an absolute miracle 

1968
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:48,731
that right at the beginning of the 
document it says straightforwardly like 

1969
01:46:48,731 --> 01:46:52,630
with no hesitation whatsoever,
the divine spark which were associated 

1970
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:57,411
with the word that brings forth being is
manifest in men and women equally.

1971
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,840
It's a very cool thing.
And you gotta think,

1972
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:01,710
well,
like I said,

1973
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,900
they actually take that seriously.
Well,

1974
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:07,290
what you got to ask is what happens if 
you don't take it seriously,

1975
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:09,990
right?
That's reading,

1976
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:13,800
read Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment.
That's the best,

1977
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:20,240
the best investigation of that tactic 
that's ever been produced.

1978
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:25,251
Because what happens in Dostoyevsky's 
crime and punishment is that the main 

1979
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:29,631
character whose name is [inaudible] 
cough decides that there's no intrinsic 

1980
01:47:29,631 --> 01:47:31,050
value to other people and that as a 
consequence,

1981
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:36,051
he can do whatever he wants.
It's only cowardice that stops him from 

1982
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:36,051
acting,
right?

1983
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:38,600
Because why would it be anything else if
other people,

1984
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:41,970
if the value of other people is just an 
arbitrary superstition,

1985
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,700
then why can't I do exactly what I want 
when I want,

1986
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,380
which is the psychopaths viewpoint.
Well,

1987
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,850
so regarding the cough does he killed 
someone who's a very horrible person and

1988
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:55,851
he has very good reasons for killing her
and he's half starved and a little bit 

1989
01:47:55,851 --> 01:47:57,420
insane and possessed by this ideology.
It's brilliant,

1990
01:47:57,421 --> 01:48:01,050
brilliant layout and he finds out 
something after he kills her,

1991
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:03,900
which is that the post killing Roscoe 
and the carbon,

1992
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:08,910
the pre killing risk walnut cove are not
the same person even a little bit 

1993
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,370
because he's broken a rule like he's 
broken and serious rule and there's no 

1994
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:14,530
going back and crime and punishment is 
is,

1995
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,560
is a,
is the best investigation I know of of 

1996
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:19,560
what happens.

1997
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,990
If you take the notion that there's 
nothing defined about the individual,

1998
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:24,270
seriously now you.

1999
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:29,530
No.
Most of the people I know who are deeply

2000
01:48:29,531 --> 01:48:32,650
atheistic and I understand why they're 
deeply atheistic,

2001
01:48:32,651 --> 01:48:35,620
they haven't contended with people like 
Dostoevsky,

2002
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:40,740
not as far as I can tell because I don't
see logical flaws in crime and 

2003
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:44,551
punishment.
I think he got the psychology exactly 

2004
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,750
right and he Dostoyevsky's amazing for 
this because in one of his books,

2005
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:48,070
the devil's,
for example,

2006
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,400
he describes a political scene scenario 
that's not much different than the one 

2007
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,151
we find yourself in now and there are 
these people who are possessed by 

2008
01:48:57,151 --> 01:48:59,660
rationalistic utopian atheistic ideas 
and they're very powerful.

2009
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:01,840
They give rise to the communist 
revolution,

2010
01:49:01,841 --> 01:49:02,350
right?
I mean,

2011
01:49:02,351 --> 01:49:07,351
they're powerful ideas and his character
Stavenhagen also acts out the the,

2012
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:14,100
the presupposition that human beings 
have no intrinsic nature and no 

2013
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:17,491
intrinsic value and it's Britain,
other brilliant investigation and 

2014
01:49:17,491 --> 01:49:19,780
Dostoevsky prophesies.
That's what I would say.

2015
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:24,370
What will happen to a society if it goes
down that road and he was dead.

2016
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:28,480
Exactly accurate.
It's uncanny to read Dostoyevsky's,

2017
01:49:28,481 --> 01:49:31,030
the Pisaster,
the devil's depending on the translation

2018
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:35,770
and then to read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
Gulag archipelago because one is fiction

2019
01:49:35,771 --> 01:49:38,200
and prophecy and the second is,
hey look,

2020
01:49:38,201 --> 01:49:43,201
it turned out exactly the way the 
Dostoyevsky said it would for exactly 

2021
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,050
the same reasons.
So it's quite remarkable.

2022
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:48,070
So well.
So the question is do you seriously with

2023
01:49:48,071 --> 01:49:53,071
the idea that a,
there's something can't cosmically 

2024
01:49:53,071 --> 01:49:55,920
constitutive about consciousness and be 
that,

2025
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,720
that,
that might well be considered divine and

2026
01:49:58,721 --> 01:50:03,721
see that that is instantiated in every 
person and then ask yourself if you're 

2027
01:50:03,821 --> 01:50:08,821
not a criminal,
if you don't act it out and then ask 

2028
01:50:08,821 --> 01:50:11,830
yourself what that means.
Is that reflective of a reality or is it

2029
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:16,831
a metaphor like maybe it's a metaphor,
complex metaphor that we have to use to 

2030
01:50:16,831 --> 01:50:20,050
organize her societies could well be,
but even as a metaphor,

2031
01:50:20,051 --> 01:50:23,500
it's,
it's true enough so that we mess with it

2032
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:27,280
at our peril and it also took people a 
very long time to figure out.

2033
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:32,440
This is genesis one.
You know what?

2034
01:50:32,441 --> 01:50:35,920
I'm probably going to stop there because
I believe it's 9:30

2035
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:38,480
and so we didn't even get to the first 
line.

2036
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,070
Yeah,
yeah.

2037
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:58,090
I want to read you a couple of things 
that we'll use as a pro drama for the 

2038
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:59,870
next lecture because our.
I'll just bounce through a collection of

2039
01:50:59,871 --> 01:51:02,600
ideas that's associated with the notion 
of divinity.

2040
01:51:02,601 --> 01:51:07,601
Okay.
And then we'll turn back to the first 

2041
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:10,150
lines when we start the next one.
I have no idea how far I'm going to get 

2042
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:12,440
through the biblical stories by the way,
because I'm trying to figure this out as

2043
01:51:12,441 --> 01:51:13,550
I go along.
Okay.

2044
01:51:13,551 --> 01:51:17,100
So you know there's an idea in 
Christianity that God,

2045
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:20,910
that the image of God is a trinity,
right?

2046
01:51:20,911 --> 01:51:25,911
There's the father is the father,
there's the element of the sun and 

2047
01:51:25,911 --> 01:51:27,770
there's the element of the Holy Spirit 
is something like tradition,

2048
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:32,890
the spirit of tradition.
It's something like the human being as 

2049
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:34,970
the newest incarnation of that 
tradition,

2050
01:51:34,971 --> 01:51:39,971
like the living incarnation of that 
tradition and then then it's something 

2051
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:44,051
like the spirit in people that makes 
relationship with this and this 

2052
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:46,040
possible,
the spirit and individuals,

2053
01:51:46,041 --> 01:51:51,041
and so I'm going to bounce my way 
quickly through some of the classical 

2054
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:56,270
metaphorical attributes of God so that 
we kind of have a cloud of notions about

2055
01:51:56,271 --> 01:52:01,271
what we're talking about when we 
returned to genesis one and talk about 

2056
01:52:01,271 --> 01:52:04,961
the God who spoke can you into to be so 
there's a fatherly aspect.

2057
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:12,040
So here's what God as a father is like.
You can enter into a covenant with it so

2058
01:52:12,381 --> 01:52:15,080
you can make a bargain with it.
Now you think about that.

2059
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:19,040
Money is like that because money is a 
bargain you make with the future.

2060
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:24,670
Right?
And so we structured our world so that 

2061
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:27,011
you can negotiate with the future and I 
don't think that we would have gone to 

2062
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:30,440
the point where we could do that without
having this idea to begin with.

2063
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:35,800
You can.
You can act as if the future is a 

2064
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,971
reality.
There's a spirit of tradition that 

2065
01:52:37,971 --> 01:52:38,300
enables you to act as if the future is 
something that can be bargained with.

2066
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:40,940
That's why you make sacrifices.
Right,

2067
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:45,080
and the sacrifices were acted out for a 
very long period of time and now they're

2068
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:48,110
psychological.
We know that you can sacrifice something

2069
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:53,111
valuable in the present and expect that 
you're negotiating with something that 

2070
01:52:53,111 --> 01:52:55,730
represents the transcendent future,
and that's a map.

2071
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:59,180
Amazing human discovery like no other 
creature can do that,

2072
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:04,270
to act as if the future is real,
to know that you can bargain with 

2073
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:05,720
reality itself and that you can do it 
successfully.

2074
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:09,110
It's an unbelievable.
It responds to sacrifice.

2075
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,560
It answers prayers.
I'm not saying that any of this is true 

2076
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,041
by the way.
I'm just saying what the what the cloud 

2077
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:21,041
of ideas represents.
It punishes and rewards it judges and 

2078
01:53:21,041 --> 01:53:22,850
forgives.
It's not nature.

2079
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,780
You see the thing about the thing that's
one of the thing that's weird about the 

2080
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:31,721
Judeo Christian tradition is that God 
and nature are not the same thing at 

2081
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:35,201
all.
Whatever God is partially manifest in 

2082
01:53:35,201 --> 01:53:35,870
this logo,
something that stands outside of nature,

2083
01:53:35,871 --> 01:53:40,871
and that's.
I think that's something like 

2084
01:53:40,871 --> 01:53:41,330
consciousness as abstracted from the 
natural world,

2085
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:46,280
so it built even for mankind and then 
banished us for disobedience.

2086
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:48,050
It's too powerful to be touched.

2087
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:52,850
It granted freewill distance from it is 
hell distance from it,

2088
01:53:52,851 --> 01:53:57,851
his death.
It reveals itself in Dogma and had 

2089
01:53:57,851 --> 01:54:01,220
mystical experience and it's the law,
so that's sorta like the fatherly aspect

2090
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:05,540
and then the sun like aspect.
It speaks chaos into order.

2091
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:08,600
It slays dragons and feeds people with 
the remains.

2092
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,920
It finds gold,
rescues virgins.

2093
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:16,090
It's the body and blood of Christ.
It's a tragic victim and scapegoat and 

2094
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:18,410
eternally Triano Triumphant Redeemer 
simultaneously.

2095
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:21,950
It cares for the outcast.
It dies and is reborn.

2096
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,830
It's the king of kings and hero of 
heroes.

2097
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,260
It's not the state,
but it's both.

2098
01:54:27,261 --> 01:54:29,780
It's both the fulfillment and critic of 
this state.

2099
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:34,310
It dwells in the perfect house.
It is aiming at Paradise or heaven.

2100
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:37,760
It can rescue from hell.
It cares for the outcast.

2101
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:43,060
It's the foundation stone and the 
cornerstone that was rejected and it's 

2102
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:43,400
the spirit of the law

2103
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:49,570
and then its spirit like it's akin to 
the human soul.

2104
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:54,990
It's the prophetic voice.
It's the still small voice of 

2105
01:54:54,990 --> 01:54:56,200
conscience.
It's the spoken truth.

2106
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:00,760
It's called forth by music.
It is the enemy of deceit,

2107
01:55:00,761 --> 01:55:02,110
arrogance,
and resentment.

2108
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:05,650
It's the water of life.
It burns without consuming,

2109
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,960
and it's a blinding light.
Okay,

2110
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:12,961
so that's a very,
that's a very well developed poetic set 

2111
01:55:12,961 --> 01:55:13,360
of poetic metaphors essentially.
Right?

2112
01:55:13,361 --> 01:55:15,070
So these are all,
what would you say?

2113
01:55:15,071 --> 01:55:19,120
Glimpses of the,
of the transcendent ideal.

2114
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:22,750
That's the right way of thinking about 
their glimpses of the transcendent ideal

2115
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:28,020
and all of them have a specific meaning 
and well in part that we're going to do 

2116
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,890
is go over that meaning as we continue 
with this,

2117
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:35,670
with this series.
And so what we've got now is a brief 

2118
01:55:36,871 --> 01:55:40,170
description at least of what this is.
In the beginning,

2119
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,550
God created the heavens and the earth.
We know it's with the logos

2120
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:49,640
in this sequence of stories.
We know it's associated with the word 

2121
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,731
end with consciousness and we know that 
it's associated with whatever God is and

2122
01:55:53,341 --> 01:55:58,341
then I laid out the metaphoric landscape
that at least in part describes God and 

2123
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:03,351
so now we have some sense of the being 
that does this creates the heavens and 

2124
01:56:03,351 --> 01:56:05,190
the earth.
The earth was without form and void.

2125
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:10,250
That's that chaotic state of 
intermingled confusion and darkness was 

2126
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:13,470
over the face of the deep and the spirit
of God was hovering over the face of the

2127
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:18,471
waters and God said,
let there be light and there was light 

2128
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:23,010
and so we'll stop with that because now 
we're ready to take attendance of step 

2129
01:56:23,891 --> 01:56:28,891
into the very first part of this book 
and it's important to have your 

2130
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:33,680
conceptual framework properly organized 
so that you can appreciate where it's 

2131
01:56:33,871 --> 01:56:36,720
going and what it might possibly meet.
And so well,

2132
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,020
I've done what I can today to.
What would you say,

2133
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:44,140
elaborate on this single word I suppose 
and,

2134
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:46,620
but it's a big word,
you know,

2135
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:51,621
so it's not so unreasonable that it 
takes a long time to get to the point 

2136
01:56:51,621 --> 01:56:53,250
where you have any sense of what it 
means at all.

2137
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,890
All right.
That is nowhere near.

2138
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,500
That is not.
I thought I would get a lot farther.

2139
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,800
Alright.
So thank you.

2140
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:12,310
Thank you.

2141
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:30,390
So we do have time for some questions.
We have to be out of here at 10:30.

2142
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:35,391
It's 9:30.
So maybe we'll have questions until 

2143
01:57:35,391 --> 01:57:38,370
someone crazy grubs,
microphone or maybe we'll have questions

2144
01:57:38,371 --> 01:57:40,080
for half an hour,
something like that.

2145
01:57:40,081 --> 01:57:44,220
And so if anybody has any questions then
there's a microphone there and there's a

2146
01:57:44,221 --> 01:57:49,221
microphone there and I'll try to answer 
them to the best that I can miss the my 

2147
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:53,990
ability.
So let's.

2148
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:54,990
Sure,
let's start.

2149
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:02,960
Okay.
So you talked about the idea of when 

2150
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,620
you're confronting something that you 
fear you,

2151
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:07,710
like you face it head on and you destroy
it,

2152
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:13,190
but then you said that the idea is when 
you're confronting something you make 

2153
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:15,630
the world that have it.
And I was wondering if you could just,

2154
01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:17,540
I mean,
just expound on,

2155
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,730
that means you make your marriage out of
the arguments.

2156
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:23,640
You know,
when you have arguments with your wife,

2157
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:28,641
you have arguments with your children,
that's that chaotic state because no 

2158
01:58:28,641 --> 01:58:31,720
one's been able to formulate a habitable
order from that,

2159
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:34,410
that domain of controversy and 
confusion.

2160
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:39,650
And then through dialogue you erect a 
structure that's a house that you can 

2161
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:40,620
both live in.
And so that's the.

2162
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:43,530
That's the idea of making the world out 
of that chaos.

2163
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:46,950
And it's frightening because you know,
if you're really ha,

2164
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:52,040
this is why people often avoid having 
disputes with people they love because 

2165
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:52,040
it's frightening,
right?

2166
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:54,700
You find out what the person's light and
you find out what your life is like,

2167
01:58:54,701 --> 01:58:56,110
God,
who wants to do that?

2168
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:58,540
Nobody.
So you know,

2169
01:58:58,541 --> 01:59:02,880
your heart rate goes up and it's it.
It's confrontation and conflict and,

2170
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:07,990
and,
and that's because you're encountering 

2171
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,170
that domain that hasn't been properly 
mapped,

2172
01:59:08,171 --> 01:59:12,160
are configured and so,
and you're doing that with your Predator

2173
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:17,161
detection systems essentially.
And so that chaos that it threatens the 

2174
01:59:17,161 --> 01:59:19,240
stability of the marriage is equivalent 
to,

2175
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,460
while it's equivalent to the serpent and
the tree,

2176
01:59:21,461 --> 01:59:23,170
that's one form of equivalence.

2177
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,420
And,
and then by dialogue,

2178
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:29,020
through dialogue and negotiation,
you formulate the problem,

2179
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:31,930
what exactly is going on here,
where exactly are we,

2180
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:36,990
what exactly is the problem?
And so you keep talking until you reach 

2181
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:38,410
a consensus about that,
when you can live with,

2182
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:43,430
when you can act out right.
And then you and maybe you come up with 

2183
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:45,850
a solution to the problem and you've 
established piece again and peace.

2184
01:59:45,851 --> 01:59:47,860
That's the house that you can both live 
in.

2185
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:53,070
And that's the chaos.
That's the chaos that people can fall 

2186
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:55,300
into all the time and often do.
And it's the chaos that makes a marriage

2187
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:58,480
wash up on the shores and transform into
like,

2188
01:59:58,481 --> 02:00:00,280
you know,
15 year divorce court,

2189
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:04,150
very horrible thing.
So that's the idea.

2190
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,030
Okay.
Thank you.

2191
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:06,510
Okay.

2192
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:17,830
Hi Dr Allison.
Thank you so much for the talk and 

2193
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:17,830
thanks for your teachings.
It's really helped me a lot.

2194
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:22,271
I had a experience in Grad school,
two English degrees and the way he 

2195
02:00:22,271 --> 02:00:23,450
described the humanities in my 
experience,

2196
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:26,810
help me understand my experience back 
then.

2197
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:29,270
So thank you.
So it's too bad.

2198
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:31,320
That's too bad that,
that happens to be the case.

2199
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:32,840
I really like that.
You know,

2200
02:00:32,841 --> 02:00:34,160
it's,
it's really not good,

2201
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:38,710
but you don't have to tell me that,
but,

2202
02:00:38,711 --> 02:00:40,600
you know,
I survived and I learned a lot and,

2203
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,210
you know,
I'm not,

2204
02:00:41,390 --> 02:00:43,850
you know,
ungrateful for my experience.

2205
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:45,220
I've learned a lot.
Um,

2206
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,480
but you said something,
you described the Bible,

2207
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,940
the collection of stories in the Bible 
and interesting way,

2208
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:51,530
and I wonder if it was on purpose,
uh,

2209
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,320
you described it as,
um,

2210
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:58,820
created by an assembly of stories 
created by many people over time.

2211
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:02,240
Uh,
that's hyperlinked into itself.

2212
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:07,600
And it sounds a lot like how I have 
description of like the internet and 

2213
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:07,600
like how that works.

2214
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,290
Yeah,
well it's not,

2215
02:01:09,291 --> 02:01:10,670
it's not accidental.
I mean,

2216
02:01:10,671 --> 02:01:12,650
because the Internet's also a 
collective.

2217
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:18,160
It's a collective endeavor.
God only knows what personality it's 

2218
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:18,680
going to manifest,
you know,

2219
02:01:18,681 --> 02:01:23,681
but it's going to manifest some 
personality because it's learning to 

2220
02:01:23,681 --> 02:01:23,681
understand us very,
very rapidly.

2221
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:28,840
So I think you could,
there's no reason not to think about it 

2222
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:32,681
as a precursor.
I mean the distance between the Bible 

2223
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:35,891
and the Internet is a lot less than the 
distance between a chimpanzee and a 

2224
02:01:35,891 --> 02:01:38,830
human being.
So it's a.

2225
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:42,440
and the difference between a book and 
the Internet is,

2226
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:47,530
it's also,
it's in some sense it's a matter of new 

2227
02:01:47,530 --> 02:01:47,530
matter of degree rather than kind.

2228
02:01:47,530 --> 02:01:51,790
So,
so in a personality,

2229
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:58,120
personality gets in by separating,
it sounds like you're talking about.

2230
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:02,370
I know I can't speculate,
you know,

2231
02:02:02,371 --> 02:02:05,730
because God only knows what's going to 
happen in the next 20 years.

2232
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:10,910
I certainly don't.
And so I don't know what the 

2233
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:12,780
preconditions are for consciousness.
I have no idea and I don't think anybody

2234
02:02:12,781 --> 02:02:15,420
knows.
So I guess we're gonna find out.

2235
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:17,310
Yup.
Yup,

2236
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:18,390
Yup.

2237
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,500
Hey Dr Peterson,
I'm curious about the connection between

2238
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:31,500
aesthetic beauty and religious 
experience.

2239
02:02:31,501 --> 02:02:34,440
I think you've hinted at it once or 
twice over the course of this lecture.

2240
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:39,760
Um,
is it possible for something that's 

2241
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:42,960
incredibly beautiful to evoke or 
religion,

2242
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:46,410
religious or mystical experience or 
something and in the same ballpark,

2243
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:48,200
that's what they're for.
Yeah.

2244
02:02:48,630 --> 02:02:51,030
You know what I mean?
If you look at the structure of like a,

2245
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:55,980
like a Renaissance Cathedral just 
yesterday was just going to check my,

2246
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,880
uh,
my tag onto.

2247
02:02:56,881 --> 02:02:59,400
I apologize you mentioned trump might 
tag onto that question.

2248
02:02:59,401 --> 02:03:01,260
The next part was,
um,

2249
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:07,100
is that why we have cathedrals built 
like a spectacular buildings as opposed 

2250
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:07,500
to a box or something?

2251
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,020
Right?
Well,

2252
02:03:08,021 --> 02:03:10,470
it says if you're going to,
how's the ultimate ideal,

2253
02:03:10,770 --> 02:03:15,770
you build something beautiful right to,
to represent it's dwelling place and it 

2254
02:03:15,901 --> 02:03:18,120
should be beautiful.
And this is something that people do.

2255
02:03:18,121 --> 02:03:19,320
You know,
what takes seriously,

2256
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:22,500
and this is especially something we 
don't take seriously in Canada.

2257
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:23,820
I mean,
one of the,

2258
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:28,880
you think about,
you think about all the hundreds of 

2259
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,821
millions of dollars that were invested 
into beauty and in Europe mean 

2260
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:35,820
spectacular,
excessive investment in beauty that's 

2261
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:40,371
paid back.
God only knows how many multiples of 

2262
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:43,581
times people make pilgrimages to Europe 
constantly because it's so beautiful 

2263
02:03:43,581 --> 02:03:48,291
that it just staggers you.
Beauty is so valuable and when we're so 

2264
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:52,881
afraid of it,
and I think we're afraid of it because 

2265
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:52,881
it does.
It's a pathway.

2266
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:54,570
It's not the only pathway to the divine.
I mean there's lot.

2267
02:03:54,571 --> 02:03:57,480
There's pathways to the divine.
Love is one of them,

2268
02:03:57,481 --> 02:04:02,481
I suppose,
but beauty especially for people who 

2269
02:04:02,481 --> 02:04:02,481
have an affinity for beauty,
it's,

2270
02:04:02,481 --> 02:04:03,300
it's like music.

2271
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,640
It's one of those things that you can't 
argue against,

2272
02:04:05,641 --> 02:04:07,590
right?
You can't even understand.

2273
02:04:07,591 --> 02:04:11,250
It just hits you and it does.
It shows you.

2274
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:13,140
Well,
it shows you the ideal.

2275
02:04:13,141 --> 02:04:15,780
That's one way of thinking about it,
but it also shows you,

2276
02:04:15,781 --> 02:04:19,230
I think it's like a vision of the 
potential future.

2277
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:22,410
It's something like that as well,
that if we just got her act together and

2278
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:27,620
beautified things that that's the place 
that we can inhabit and that would end 

2279
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:31,710
us and that's why this Jerusalem heavily
city is paved with gemstones.

2280
02:04:31,711 --> 02:04:32,750
You know,
their crystalline,

2281
02:04:32,751 --> 02:04:37,751
the admit light and yeah,
it's the proper dwelling place for an 

2282
02:04:37,751 --> 02:04:41,481
enlightened God is the proper dwelling 
place for an enlightened consciousness 

2283
02:04:41,481 --> 02:04:45,930
and we ignore it at our spiritual and 
economic peril.

2284
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,810
It's like,
it's obvious that duty.

2285
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:52,680
There's almost nothing more valuable 
than beauty economically,

2286
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:53,560
practically.
Right.

2287
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,250
So yeah,
why that is.

2288
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:57,150
I mean,
I don't.

2289
02:04:57,930 --> 02:05:00,000
It's very,
who knows.

2290
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:04,770
I mean why we experienced gemstones for 
example,

2291
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:06,420
is beautiful.
It's very mysterious,

2292
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:09,420
but they're deep reasons for it.
So.

2293
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:11,350
Yeah.

2294
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:16,590
Alright,

2295
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:19,080
I have a bit of a similar question 
actually.

2296
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,200
I know one of the ways in which,
um,

2297
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:27,230
the Bible is appreciated even by some of
its harshest critics and deeply a people

2298
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:33,770
is as a work of literature and is 
something I'm at least I'm the King 

2299
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:37,731
James or the authorized translation of 
the Bible is something very 

2300
02:05:37,731 --> 02:05:40,191
aesthetically beautiful and a great work
of literature and a great work of 

2301
02:05:40,191 --> 02:05:40,191
poetry.
Um,

2302
02:05:40,191 --> 02:05:45,170
and I'm wondering just from your study 
of it and from your personal 

2303
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:45,170
perspective,
if there's any,

2304
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:50,020
any particular passages or are parts of 
it that you find particularly have 

2305
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:51,570
struck you in that way or that you,
that you cherish more than,

2306
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,670
more than any others that you'd be able 
to share or.

2307
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:55,770
Well,
the ones that have really opened,

2308
02:05:55,850 --> 02:06:00,850
the ones that have really opened up to 
me I think are the stories in genesis 

2309
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:02,430
right up to the tower of Babel because I
think,

2310
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:04,830
well hopefully I'll be able to talk to 
all of you about that,

2311
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:08,460
but I think I got some sense of what 
they mean and why.

2312
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:13,410
I mean I know it's not exhaustive and 
obviously but like and then the story in

2313
02:06:13,411 --> 02:06:18,411
exodus as well.
I also feel like I've got a handle on 

2314
02:06:18,411 --> 02:06:19,800
that and so those have those have hit me
really,

2315
02:06:19,801 --> 02:06:22,140
really hard and that,
you know what I mean?

2316
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:27,350
Just trying to understand this first 
part of genesis to try to understand 

2317
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:30,651
what these concepts mean has been.
Especially when I started to understand 

2318
02:06:30,651 --> 02:06:33,900
that the concept that human beings are 
made in God's image,

2319
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:36,870
God is has all those attributes that we 
just described,

2320
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:39,330
that human beings are made in God's 
image,

2321
02:06:39,331 --> 02:06:41,910
but that's actually the cornerstone of 
our legal system.

2322
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:46,910
That really,
that really rattled me because I didn't 

2323
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:50,901
understand that clearly that our body of
laws has that metaphysical 

2324
02:06:50,901 --> 02:06:55,611
presupposition without which the laws 
fall apart and that's starting to 

2325
02:06:55,611 --> 02:06:56,160
happen.
It really is.

2326
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:58,380
You know,
like the postmodern critique of law.

2327
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:03,530
The law schools are,
I would say they're overrun by 

2328
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:06,780
postmodernists two are undermining the 
structure of western law as fast as they

2329
02:07:06,781 --> 02:07:11,781
possibly can because they don't buy any 
of this and so they're much more likely 

2330
02:07:11,781 --> 02:07:15,681
to just think of the law is something at
like a like a casual pragmatic tool to 

2331
02:07:15,691 --> 02:07:18,960
be manipulated for the purposes of 
bringing forth the utopia.

2332
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,850
It's a really,
really,

2333
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:25,910
really bad idea.
So it's very strange to me that we go 

2334
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:29,220
off track when that metaphysical 
foundation starts to get rattled.

2335
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:29,780
So

2336
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:35,070
do you think your,
your appreciation of the aesthetic 

2337
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:37,070
beauty of it comes from a belief in the 
truth that it's the underlying 

2338
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:41,161
propositions.
I mean that's just because even the 

2339
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:43,801
atheistic critics,
I'm thinking of like even Dawkins or 

2340
02:07:43,801 --> 02:07:46,530
hitchens really appreciate the Bible as 
just a piece of I'm really beautiful 

2341
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:50,851
literature and I guess the quality of 
the writing and the sort of exalted 

2342
02:07:50,851 --> 02:07:54,481
themes behind it,
even if they totally reject the 

2343
02:07:54,481 --> 02:07:54,481
underlying premises of it,
but you seem to.

2344
02:07:54,481 --> 02:07:54,481
Yeah,
well I don't,

2345
02:07:54,481 --> 02:07:58,880
I don't think that you can see it as 
beautiful and poetic with the and reject

2346
02:07:58,881 --> 02:08:02,720
the underlying premises because if you 
see it as beautiful and poetic,

2347
02:08:02,721 --> 02:08:07,721
you're accepting the underlying premises
with your experience of the beauty and 

2348
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:12,251
the poetics,
even though you may be fighting it with 

2349
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:14,861
your articulated rationality.
So I think all that indicates is a 

2350
02:08:14,861 --> 02:08:17,570
disintegrated perspective on the book.
Not.

2351
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:19,910
It's not surprising that that's the 
case.

2352
02:08:19,911 --> 02:08:20,770
I mean it,
it,

2353
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:24,590
it's the perspective that everyone has 
on the book except with them.

2354
02:08:24,591 --> 02:08:26,660
It's more well developed and well 
thought through,

2355
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:32,080
but I think it's fundamentally they're 
not approaching the thing with enough 

2356
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:35,120
respect.
That's my sense is they and who knows,

2357
02:08:35,121 --> 02:08:35,900
right.
Because I don't.

2358
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:40,930
I don't know,
but what I've tried to do is to think 

2359
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:41,120
there's probably more to this than I 
know,

2360
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:45,230
and then try to understand it from that 
perspective rather than to think,

2361
02:08:45,231 --> 02:08:50,231
for example,
once a collection of of superstitions 

2362
02:08:50,231 --> 02:08:50,240
that we've somehow grown.

2363
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:51,020
It's like,
no,

2364
02:08:51,021 --> 02:08:52,550
it's just.
Sorry that's,

2365
02:08:53,450 --> 02:08:57,080
that's not a deep enough analysis 
because it's got some truth,

2366
02:08:57,081 --> 02:09:02,081
but it doesn't take into account the 
fact that the proposition still stand at

2367
02:09:04,671 --> 02:09:08,090
the foundation of our culture.
It doesn't address niches,

2368
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:10,910
central concern,
which is that if you blow out the notion

2369
02:09:10,911 --> 02:09:14,270
of God,
the entire structure crumbled and Owen,

2370
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,850
you can debate that fine.
But I just,

2371
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:21,890
you know,
just assume that you debated it with 

2372
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:21,890
nature because he's a pretty tough 
customer to tangle with.

2373
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:27,070
So I don't think the,
the atheist types in so far as there's a

2374
02:09:27,171 --> 02:09:32,171
type.
I don't think they've wrestled with the 

2375
02:09:32,171 --> 02:09:32,171
real problems.
So.

2376
02:09:32,171 --> 02:09:32,171
Yeah.

2377
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,380
So I appreciate you setting some ground 
rules.

2378
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:42,680
Keep things rational and,
uh,

2379
02:09:42,690 --> 02:09:45,930
I think that's going to help us.
What I'm wondering is,

2380
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:48,570
so for instance,
you had said elsewhere,

2381
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:54,380
the new testament from the best from 
what you can see it's psychologically 

2382
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:54,750
correct.
Uh,

2383
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:59,970
and that's quite astounding.
I would say there's a lot of truth and 

2384
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:02,040
in your depictions of these stories 
elsewhere,

2385
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,760
you've pointed out like deep truths,
you know,

2386
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:09,780
the real powerful.
So what my question would be is if we 

2387
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:14,751
can say Nietzsche took a,
like in order of magnitude of a 

2388
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:20,780
intelligence and the depth to be able to
predict what would happen to the next 

2389
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:21,750
side century,
you know,

2390
02:10:21,751 --> 02:10:25,950
rationally if the Bible's not the 
inherent word of God,

2391
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:27,540
what's going on?

2392
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:31,250
That's a good question.
That's a really good question.

2393
02:10:31,251 --> 02:10:36,251
I mean,
I'm going to try to answer that 

2394
02:10:36,251 --> 02:10:36,251
rationally but uh,
but,

2395
02:10:36,251 --> 02:10:36,251
uh,
and as we move forward,

2396
02:10:36,251 --> 02:10:41,201
but as I said,
I don't want to leave people with the 

2397
02:10:41,201 --> 02:10:41,201
notion because you know,
some ways.

2398
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:44,750
This is something I've thought about.
What I've been thinking about for a long

2399
02:10:44,751 --> 02:10:49,751
time is I can't tell if I'm a like an 
advocate of the religious viewpoint or 

2400
02:10:49,751 --> 02:10:54,071
its worst possible critic because I am 
doing my best to make it rational and 

2401
02:10:54,071 --> 02:10:55,490
there's an reductionistic element to 
that,

2402
02:10:55,491 --> 02:11:00,491
but I think that I'm doing that while 
also leaving the door open to things 

2403
02:11:00,491 --> 02:11:02,360
that I don't understand because I know 
that there's.

2404
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:07,570
There's more to this story than I 
understand or can understand and I'm 

2405
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:09,020
laying out what I can understand it.
I'm making it rational,

2406
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:14,021
but I do not believe for an instant that
that exhausts the realm.

2407
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:19,660
It's like there.
There are ways of interpreting these 

2408
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:21,290
stories that work in the conceptual 
universe we inhabit right now,

2409
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:24,730
but there's a lot of things that we 
don't understand.

2410
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,800
What I'm thing I found about digging 
into these stories is that the deeper 

2411
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:29,800
you dig,
the more you find,

2412
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:35,050
and that's pretty damned.
That's one of the things that convinced 

2413
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:37,451
me that there was more to them that I 
had originally suspected because things 

2414
02:11:37,451 --> 02:11:37,610
would click and I think,
wow,

2415
02:11:37,611 --> 02:11:40,400
that's really.
That's really something and then I would

2416
02:11:40,401 --> 02:11:44,030
take it apart further and I think whole,
well I thought that was something,

2417
02:11:44,031 --> 02:11:46,400
but this is.
This is even more remarkable.

2418
02:11:46,401 --> 02:11:50,240
It just keeps opening and opening and so
I'm going to make it rational.

2419
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:53,390
I'm going to try to provide an answer to
and it is.

2420
02:11:53,391 --> 02:11:58,391
I think you're right about speaking 
about niche and his capacity for 

2421
02:11:58,391 --> 02:11:58,730
prophecy and Dostoyevsky's in the same 
category,

2422
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,260
so like there are prophetic elements to 
the old and New Testament that seemed to

2423
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:08,261
stretch over much vaster spans of time 
and I'm going to try to produce a 

2424
02:12:08,261 --> 02:12:09,380
rational account of that.

2425
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:14,620
But I mean one of the reasons that I 
think the new testament is 

2426
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:14,620
psychologically true,
let's say is because,

2427
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:17,340
and this is one of the things that's,
that's,

2428
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:20,030
that's deeply embedded in the structure 
of the Bible.

2429
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:25,031
In the Old Testament.
There's this idea and I'm skipping 

2430
02:12:25,031 --> 02:12:28,580
ahead,
that through a succession of states,

2431
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:33,680
the people who behave properly will 
eventually establish the proper state.

2432
02:12:33,910 --> 02:12:36,410
And so the state is viewed in some sense
as the,

2433
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:41,030
as the entity of salvation.
But what happens in the new testament is

2434
02:12:41,031 --> 02:12:46,031
that idea gets,
you could say deconstructed and instead 

2435
02:12:46,031 --> 02:12:49,220
of a state being the place of 
redemption,

2436
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:52,190
a state of being becomes the State of 
redemption.

2437
02:12:52,191 --> 02:12:57,191
And so the idea that human beings will 
be redeemed moves from the Utopian state

2438
02:12:58,671 --> 02:13:01,850
vision to the responsibility of the 
individual.

2439
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:04,040
And I think that's correct.
I mean,

2440
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:09,900
I believe that that's the right answer.
And I think that West in particular is 

2441
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:15,041
predicated on the idea that idea because
it makes the state subservient to the 

2442
02:13:15,041 --> 02:13:16,400
individual.
I mean there's a,

2443
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,330
there's a what,
a dialogue,

2444
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:22,520
a continual dialogue.
But in the final analysis,

2445
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,710
the locus of the divine is the 
individual,

2446
02:13:24,711 --> 02:13:28,460
not the state.
And I believe that that's so true,

2447
02:13:28,461 --> 02:13:30,710
that if we don't act it out and believe 
it,

2448
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:34,290
then all die painfully.
And that's true enough for me.

2449
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:35,860
So thank you.

2450
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:36,230
Yeah.

2451
02:13:41,770 --> 02:13:46,770
Or eliminating talk.
I'm going to keep you on the creation 

2452
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:50,701
story and if you don't mind,
because we know this editing that was 

2453
02:13:50,701 --> 02:13:52,030
done,
there was the purpose for the editing.

2454
02:13:52,570 --> 02:13:57,280
Can you give us your thoughts about the 
difference in the story of creation,

2455
02:13:57,281 --> 02:14:01,210
especially pertaining to men from the 
first chapter,

2456
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:03,790
which is very godlike,
you know,

2457
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:08,820
by a word after the second one,
which is more like a fatherly type of 

2458
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:11,950
creation.
Is it a selling point?

2459
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:16,210
What was the reason for this type of 
editing to put the two together?

2460
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:18,660
Well,
I think you know,

2461
02:14:18,990 --> 02:14:23,990
the more cynical would you call critic 
criticisms of the Bible and the 

2462
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:27,990
religious tradition,
criticisms like Marxists or Freud's even

2463
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:31,430
for that matter make the case that it's 
a power.

2464
02:14:31,431 --> 02:14:36,431
It's a manifestation of power in 
politics and that there's always a 

2465
02:14:36,431 --> 02:14:40,971
political or economic motivation behind 
the construction of the stories and I 

2466
02:14:40,971 --> 02:14:44,961
think that that's true to some degree,
but I don't think that it's true enough 

2467
02:14:44,961 --> 02:14:49,560
so that you can take that particular 
interpretive tack and be done with it.

2468
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:55,040
And I would say that to the degree that 
there are political and economic 

2469
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:55,860
motivations that have shaped the 
stories,

2470
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:58,770
the fact that multiple stories have come
together,

2471
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,750
they're sort of corrective in some 
sense.

2472
02:15:00,751 --> 02:15:05,751
And so even at the level of detail,
there's political intrigue and politics 

2473
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:10,230
say with regards to the ascendancy of 
Israel,

2474
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:16,190
when you step away from it,
it becomes something that's more 

2475
02:15:16,190 --> 02:15:17,340
universal and escapes from that.
And how that happened.

2476
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:19,660
Oh,
I don't know.

2477
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:23,290
I mean,
I think safe to say it's reasonably safe

2478
02:15:23,291 --> 02:15:25,720
to say that the people who put this 
document together,

2479
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:30,930
they did two things.
I think they were guided by their 

2480
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:32,200
aesthetic taste and their conscience.
I truly believe that.

2481
02:15:32,410 --> 02:15:37,240
And the reason I believe that is because
I think anything that was propagandistic

2482
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:41,320
would have been forgotten because he 
can't remember propaganda.

2483
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:46,710
No one likes it.
It's like it's dead 10 years after you 

2484
02:15:46,710 --> 02:15:49,471
write it or 20 years.
And it isn't only that these books were 

2485
02:15:49,471 --> 02:15:52,801
assembled in written.
It was that they were preserved and 

2486
02:15:52,801 --> 02:15:55,711
remembered.
And to me that means they have an 

2487
02:15:55,711 --> 02:15:55,900
affinity with the structure of memory.
I mean,

2488
02:15:55,930 --> 02:15:58,480
you think about it,
how does this story last 10,000

2489
02:15:58,481 --> 02:16:03,481
years,
unless it's the kind of story you can 

2490
02:16:03,481 --> 02:16:05,281
remember,
it doesn't because you forget all of 

2491
02:16:05,281 --> 02:16:06,040
forgettable stuff and all you remember 
is the memorable stuff.

2492
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:11,340
And so there's this,
there's this interplay between the 

2493
02:16:12,191 --> 02:16:17,191
document itself,
found its audience that shapes the 

2494
02:16:17,191 --> 02:16:18,160
document.
And so now,

2495
02:16:18,161 --> 02:16:20,800
I don't know how specifically I answered
your question.

2496
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:26,300
Um,
we're going to hit this different 

2497
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:28,240
stories as they come up and sequence and
I think I'll shed some more light on the

2498
02:16:28,241 --> 02:16:32,470
relationship between doing that and 
we'll start with that next week.

2499
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:38,670
Okay,
great.

2500
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:39,870
So,
um,

2501
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:45,080
I've been really interested in a lot of 
the stuff that you've been saying about 

2502
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:47,820
dreams because I've been lucid dreaming 
a lot for many years,

2503
02:16:47,850 --> 02:16:52,850
but always in a sort of atheistic way.
It's sort of like a game or something 

2504
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:53,400
like that.
But um,

2505
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:56,280
because of seeing your talks and 
everything,

2506
02:16:56,281 --> 02:16:58,020
I've started to think of it from a 
different perspective.

2507
02:16:58,021 --> 02:17:03,021
Like you're now interfacing with 
something beyond the narrow scope of 

2508
02:17:03,021 --> 02:17:05,850
your conscious awareness that or 
something like that,

2509
02:17:05,851 --> 02:17:07,800
maybe mythological or maybe something 
like God.

2510
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:13,220
And so what I've been thinking about and
what I maybe wonder what you think about

2511
02:17:13,531 --> 02:17:16,950
it is that in some ways when you're 
lucid dreaming,

2512
02:17:16,951 --> 02:17:20,070
you're kind of tread.
You're getting beyond the limitations of

2513
02:17:20,071 --> 02:17:23,490
an ordinary dream or sort of trends 
sending limitations,

2514
02:17:23,491 --> 02:17:27,450
which maybe is like,
it's not the purpose of people,

2515
02:17:27,451 --> 02:17:32,451
right?
It's because as a person who was 

2516
02:17:32,451 --> 02:17:34,531
supposed to be limited in some way as 
opposed to like God who's like not 

2517
02:17:34,531 --> 02:17:37,611
limited and how,
but on the other hand it's a good 

2518
02:17:37,611 --> 02:17:40,521
opportunity to kind of have control over
your interactions with this like very 

2519
02:17:40,521 --> 02:17:44,781
special and interesting thing.
So I guess the conundrum is that on one 

2520
02:17:44,781 --> 02:17:46,500
hand like you can,
you can control your interactions,

2521
02:17:46,501 --> 02:17:48,570
but on the other hand,
like you are controlling them.

2522
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:52,500
So I guess I'm wondering what you think 
about that and also just in general,

2523
02:17:52,501 --> 02:17:54,390
what do you think about lucid dreaming 
as a thing?

2524
02:17:54,391 --> 02:17:55,470
Like should you do it?
Or.

2525
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:57,490
I had a client who could really lucid 
dream,

2526
02:17:57,491 --> 02:18:02,491
you know,
and one of the things she used them now 

2527
02:18:02,491 --> 02:18:05,491
and then to solve problems even though 
she didn't always pay attention to that 

2528
02:18:05,491 --> 02:18:05,491
answer,
but sometimes she did.

2529
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:11,580
She went to her in one of her dreams,
one of the characters told her that she 

2530
02:18:11,901 --> 02:18:14,060
would have to learn to live in a 
slaughter house.

2531
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:19,540
She was very afraid of life and one of 
the consequences of that was that we 

2532
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:20,060
went and watched an embalming,

2533
02:18:20,890 --> 02:18:21,460
so,

2534
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:24,450
so the dreams were.
But one of the things she did,

2535
02:18:24,451 --> 02:18:26,790
she'd asked the characters what they 
were up to,

2536
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:28,680
you know,
she was instead of controlling,

2537
02:18:28,681 --> 02:18:33,240
she would inquire and so,
but I don't know what to say about lucid

2538
02:18:33,241 --> 02:18:38,241
dreaming beyond that.
Like I know it's a well documented 

2539
02:18:38,241 --> 02:18:40,640
phenomenon and many people can do it and
women seem to be able to do it better 

2540
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:40,920
than men.
That's what the research indicates.

2541
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:45,300
But I think that what we don't know 
about lucid dreaming could fill a lot of

2542
02:18:45,301 --> 02:18:47,940
books.
So I think you do.

2543
02:18:47,970 --> 02:18:52,020
There is some danger in controlling it,
I think because you lose the spontaneous

2544
02:18:52,021 --> 02:18:54,330
revelation,
although not completely because he can't

2545
02:18:54,331 --> 02:18:57,660
control it completely,
but I like you see,

2546
02:18:57,690 --> 02:19:02,690
you might be interested in reading 
humans works on active imagination 

2547
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:07,130
because he kind of learned to dream when
he was awake and he spent a lot of time 

2548
02:19:07,130 --> 02:19:10,590
in the world of imagination when he was 
awake.

2549
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:11,910
The red books,
for example,

2550
02:19:11,911 --> 02:19:16,560
the red book is as a document of his 
experiences with awake dreaming,

2551
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:19,290
but he was very interactive with the 
dream,

2552
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:24,320
you know,
instead of trying to bend it to his 

2553
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:24,320
Morris will,
he was,

2554
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:29,270
he was exploring it in some sense like 
you explore a video game right now which

2555
02:19:29,271 --> 02:19:31,700
are forms of dreams in and of 
themselves.

2556
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:36,760
So yeah,
I would say do it with an exploratory 

2557
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:39,230
purpose in mind and you could always ask
yourself what you could learn to,

2558
02:19:39,231 --> 02:19:44,231
which is a very dangerous question to 
ask a dream because sometimes you'll 

2559
02:19:44,231 --> 02:19:45,530
find out what you have to learn.
Now it's not so pleasant,

2560
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:48,610
but it's really worthwhile.
Okay.

2561
02:19:48,870 --> 02:19:53,520
Yup.
Okay,

2562
02:19:53,521 --> 02:19:58,521
so I think,
I think I'm going to take four more 

2563
02:19:58,521 --> 02:20:00,861
questions only because I'm running out 
of brain and I don't want to say stupid 

2564
02:20:00,861 --> 02:20:02,700
things,
so or stupid or things that I've already

2565
02:20:02,701 --> 02:20:03,360
said so.

2566
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:06,220
So yeah.
Thank you for the talk.

2567
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:10,450
I'm in the beginning of your lecture,
you talked about how society needed this

2568
02:20:10,451 --> 02:20:15,451
kind of dreamlike religious base,
so we don't go between left and right 

2569
02:20:16,211 --> 02:20:21,211
violently and we can kind of have this 
base and then you also said you admired 

2570
02:20:21,211 --> 02:20:24,951
Nisha for kind of a chopping down these,
these ideological and kind of dogmatic 

2571
02:20:25,481 --> 02:20:28,210
weeds coming up from the base of 
Christianity.

2572
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:33,700
I was wondering how what your thoughts 
are on how society can have this kind of

2573
02:20:33,701 --> 02:20:38,701
religious base without having these kind
of dangerous ideologies that can spring 

2574
02:20:38,701 --> 02:20:39,130
up once a month.

2575
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:42,500
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Not really.

2576
02:20:42,501 --> 02:20:45,410
I mean that really that's the serious 
answer to that question.

2577
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:48,680
No,
I mean the reason that I'm an admirer of

2578
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:51,930
niches because he was the spirit of his 
time,

2579
02:20:51,931 --> 02:20:53,540
so that's a good way of thinking about 
it.

2580
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,840
It's not like nature killed God.
It's the nature gathered what was in the

2581
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:04,451
air and articulated it right incredibly 
profoundly in so he put his finger on 

2582
02:21:05,661 --> 02:21:10,661
the spot and in doing so he announced 
the problem and once you announced the 

2583
02:21:11,331 --> 02:21:16,331
problem,
then maybe you can come up with a 

2584
02:21:16,331 --> 02:21:18,371
solution because you can't solve a 
problem unless you know what it is and 

2585
02:21:18,371 --> 02:21:20,000
the fact that he made it so stark and so
clear,

2586
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:25,420
it was horrifying in some sense,
but at least we know where we stand and 

2587
02:21:25,461 --> 02:21:30,461
so since then I would say particularly 
with in many ways,

2588
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:36,251
particularly with the work of yoga and 
and everything that's come out of that 

2589
02:21:36,251 --> 02:21:39,020
which is the deeper study of mythology 
and its meanings and we'd been trying to

2590
02:21:39,021 --> 02:21:42,530
address that.
The issue that you brought up and trying

2591
02:21:42,531 --> 02:21:47,531
to solve the problem and the problem is 
something like the reunification of the 

2592
02:21:47,531 --> 02:21:48,170
spirit of mankind.
It's something like that.

2593
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:51,650
Well,
we're slogging through it,

2594
02:21:51,651 --> 02:21:53,570
man.
That's it.

2595
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:55,790
That's why you're all here,
at least in part.

2596
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:58,340
So we'll see how far we can get by at 
this rate.

2597
02:21:58,341 --> 02:22:00,890
We'll get to like the twelfth verse in 
the first,

2598
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:03,740
but that's the aim,
you know.

2599
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:04,720
Okay.

2600
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:15,350
Okay.
So first we have access to the slides.

2601
02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:16,870
Yes.
You'll be in the,

2602
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:22,420
there'll be in the video.
I could also make them available as 

2603
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:24,640
slides.
Slides.

2604
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,580
Yeah.
Well that's okay.

2605
02:22:26,581 --> 02:22:29,160
I'll return to this when we,
when we get going again.

2606
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:30,090
So.

2607
02:22:30,310 --> 02:22:35,310
Awesome.
You mentioned the significant.

2608
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:41,320
Oh yeah.
Different colors represent the distance 

2609
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:41,320
between the,
between the,

2610
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,680
um,
the cross references.

2611
02:22:44,010 --> 02:22:44,340
Yeah.

2612
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:50,880
Is the Holy Spirit as the logos?

2613
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:55,430
Well,
I'll talk about that more next time.

2614
02:22:55,431 --> 02:23:00,431
I mean,
I think that the best answer to that is 

2615
02:23:00,431 --> 02:23:01,260
I'll talk more about that next time.
I mean,

2616
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:04,760
I think of them as overlapping 
metaphorical domains.

2617
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:10,170
You know,
when the descriptions I put up the 

2618
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:10,170
fatherly aspect,
the second aspect and the spirit aspect.

2619
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:11,660
You could swap a lot of those,
you know,

2620
02:23:11,661 --> 02:23:13,710
it's kind of arbitrary,
but I think they're,

2621
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:17,750
I think the trinitarian idea is trying 
to get forward.

2622
02:23:17,751 --> 02:23:21,230
The notion that the locus of the divine 
is,

2623
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:25,820
is it's the same thing in its essence,
but it exists in a multiplicity.

2624
02:23:25,821 --> 02:23:30,821
It exists as the spirit of tradition,
it exists as the living individual in 

2625
02:23:31,011 --> 02:23:35,270
the in time and space and that it exists
as the spirit that,

2626
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:35,930
that,
that,

2627
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:39,230
that and is consciousness,
something like that that we all share,

2628
02:23:39,430 --> 02:23:40,310
which,
which you know,

2629
02:23:40,311 --> 02:23:45,311
young would have thought about that as 
something like the capacity for the 

2630
02:23:45,311 --> 02:23:48,761
individual to realize that tragedy and 
redemption of Christ in their individual

2631
02:23:50,211 --> 02:23:55,211
life and that's something like your 
capacity to voluntarily accept the 

2632
02:23:55,941 --> 02:24:00,941
tragic conditions of your exist in San 
to move forward to something resembling 

2633
02:24:00,941 --> 02:24:02,720
paradise.
Regardless of that,

2634
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:08,050
you know as something that's intrinsic 
to you and I think that's associated 

2635
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:09,410
with the idea of the pentecost and,
and,

2636
02:24:09,411 --> 02:24:11,060
and the Holy Spirit,
all of that.

2637
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:15,350
It's so that that's as good as I can do 
in a short period of time.

2638
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:15,890
So

2639
02:24:16,970 --> 02:24:21,970
Yup.
Contract or a legal system.

2640
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:30,190
Religion.

2641
02:24:35,050 --> 02:24:37,450
I think it's because it's because of 
the,

2642
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:40,900
the gap between what we articulated,
what we don't know.

2643
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:45,070
Something has to fill that gap.
Like I think the law could be,

2644
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:47,800
could,
could replace it if the law was total,

2645
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:49,550
but it isn't it,
it's,

2646
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:54,620
it's,
it's bounded and the incorrect and 

2647
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:57,061
there's something in wrists.
It has to rest on something inside 

2648
02:24:57,061 --> 02:25:00,811
that's like this mediator between what 
we articulate and what we don't 

2649
02:25:00,811 --> 02:25:01,200
understand.
It's something like custom.

2650
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:06,201
It's something like expectation.
It's something like the intrinsic sense 

2651
02:25:06,201 --> 02:25:10,081
of justice,
you know that the law itself is aiming 

2652
02:25:10,081 --> 02:25:13,051
at and those aren't fully articulated,
but without them there'd be no 

2653
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:15,520
grounding.
Like without the body,

2654
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,640
the law would be a dictionary,
you know,

2655
02:25:18,641 --> 02:25:22,240
and if you don't know what a word means,
using the dictionary is helpful,

2656
02:25:22,241 --> 02:25:26,740
but not that because like unless you've 
had the experience of anger,

2657
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,930
the dictionary can't tell you what anger
means.

2658
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:33,930
It's just refers to other words,
but the words themselves refer to 

2659
02:25:33,930 --> 02:25:37,741
something else and the law refers to 
something else and without that it has 

2660
02:25:37,741 --> 02:25:42,691
to be in tune with that.
Something else has to be in accordance 

2661
02:25:42,691 --> 02:25:45,721
with it.
And so I don't think we can ever 

2662
02:25:45,721 --> 02:25:49,050
delineate the proper body of laws and 
that's also why you like ideological 

2663
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:51,200
utopias.
See,

2664
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:54,550
the ideological utopia is dispensed with
the transcendent.

2665
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:58,120
They say,
this is what we need to do.

2666
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:59,380
It's like,
no,

2667
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:00,130
you don't.
No,

2668
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:05,460
that's not good.
You have to leave space for what you 

2669
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:06,850
kind of known for what you don't know 
and I mean,

2670
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:08,980
you know in the story of the Tower of 
Babel,

2671
02:26:08,981 --> 02:26:13,810
human beings make this massive building.
It's supposed to reach up to the heavens

2672
02:26:13,811 --> 02:26:16,030
so that it'll take the place of God.
Well,

2673
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:21,031
that's.
That's the earliest warning we have of 

2674
02:26:21,031 --> 02:26:24,720
the danger of making things so big that 
you confuse them with God and God gets 

2675
02:26:25,301 --> 02:26:30,301
irritated and comes down and makes 
everybody speak different languages and 

2676
02:26:30,301 --> 02:26:30,301
scatters them.

2677
02:26:30,301 --> 02:26:30,301
It's like,
well,

2678
02:26:30,301 --> 02:26:34,711
that's what happens when you try to make
something a totality is that it starts 

2679
02:26:34,711 --> 02:26:38,400
to fragment inside and disintegrates 
into catastrophe and so it's,

2680
02:26:38,430 --> 02:26:43,330
it's almost as if we have to maintain 
this articulated space inside the dream,

2681
02:26:43,331 --> 02:26:46,240
inside the customer,
something like that because otherwise it

2682
02:26:46,241 --> 02:26:51,241
doesn't work.
And I think that's the same as having 

2683
02:26:51,241 --> 02:26:51,241
respect for the fact that we have 
bodies.

2684
02:26:51,241 --> 02:26:56,100
You know,
we're not just abstract creatures that 

2685
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:56,100
follow rules.
We're not that at all,

2686
02:26:56,100 --> 02:27:01,080
we only follow certain rules,
we won't follow the other ones and our 

2687
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:03,070
societies will crumble.
And so,

2688
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:08,520
and we just don't know enough to 
articulate the entire landscape of 

2689
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:10,720
behavior with articulated rules.
Not at all.

2690
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:12,400
We can't do it.
It's beyond us.

2691
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:14,170
Yep.
Yep.

2692
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:24,110
Thanks for the talk.
My question is also about dreams.

2693
02:27:24,111 --> 02:27:26,630
Uh,
you spoke about dreams as a,

2694
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:30,650
like a representation of truth and 
universal truths that,

2695
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:34,470
uh,
can be interpreted into like myths and,

2696
02:27:34,490 --> 02:27:37,730
and religion and uh,
as,

2697
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:42,820
as you say,
it's very beneficial for the individual 

2698
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:46,091
and it sounds like also for,
for the society as well because not 

2699
02:27:46,091 --> 02:27:50,141
everyone can as easily.
I'm a rep,

2700
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:53,540
remember their dreams are or interpreted
their creams like that.

2701
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:55,460
And also it's,
it's,

2702
02:27:55,461 --> 02:27:57,710
um,
like broadcast at to,

2703
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:02,800
to all of society for their benefits.
So I guess I'm wondering what the 

2704
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:06,380
evolutionary advantage of dreams are.
And my question would be,

2705
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:11,830
do you think that dreams,
I'm a suggests some sort of a 

2706
02:28:12,510 --> 02:28:17,450
evolutionary group selection such that 
like groups that don't have these dreams

2707
02:28:17,451 --> 02:28:20,210
that are represented into myths and 
religion to be think they,

2708
02:28:20,330 --> 02:28:21,950
they didn't as well.

2709
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:27,400
Okay,
so I'm not gonna answer the second part 

2710
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,741
of that question because I'd have to go 
far too far off at a tangent for me to 

2711
02:28:29,751 --> 02:28:34,751
manage right now,
but I can answer the first part being 

2712
02:28:34,751 --> 02:28:35,840
what happens when you're dreaming.
There's a little switch so to speak,

2713
02:28:35,841 --> 02:28:38,960
in your brain that shuts off when you're
dreaming and it stops you from moving,

2714
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,840
right?
It shuts everything off except your eyes

2715
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:44,300
because you know you're moving your eyes
back and forth.

2716
02:28:44,301 --> 02:28:46,730
You're not going to get run around and 
get eaten by a lion.

2717
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:51,760
It's okay to move your eyes,
but the rescue was standing exactly 

2718
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:54,791
where it is.
Then you can run these simulations and 

2719
02:28:54,791 --> 02:28:58,181
so what's happening at night,
and this is a fairly well accepted 

2720
02:28:58,181 --> 02:29:02,050
theory of dreaming.
We know that dreams update memories and 

2721
02:29:02,050 --> 02:29:02,330
help consolidate memories.
They also help you forget,

2722
02:29:02,810 --> 02:29:05,690
but what seems to be happening at night 
is that you're.

2723
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:10,900
You're running the underlying 
architecture of your cognitive ability 

2724
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:12,420
in different simulations,
but we're,

2725
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:14,930
and it's cost free because you're 
paralyzed,

2726
02:29:14,931 --> 02:29:17,570
you're not running around.
They're owed in the world investigating,

2727
02:29:17,571 --> 02:29:22,571
so it's part of the manner in which your
brain experiments with the way the world

2728
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:28,061
can be represented and so and it seems 
absolutely necessary and I mean if you 

2729
02:29:29,301 --> 02:29:33,200
deprive people of rem sleep,
they don't stay sane very long.

2730
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:37,190
There's something necessary about the 
dreaming process to maintenance of the,

2731
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:38,390
of,
of,

2732
02:29:38,510 --> 02:29:43,510
of articulated sanity.
So you're doing some kind of 

2733
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:45,620
organization at night when you descend 
into that chaos.

2734
02:29:45,621 --> 02:29:49,120
And partly what seems to happen is that 
your categorical no,

2735
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:51,800
your categories have boundaries,
right?

2736
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:56,920
Sometimes you don't have the categories 
correct and so the boundaries have to 

2737
02:29:56,920 --> 02:30:00,791
loosen and other things need to be put 
into categories where some things 

2738
02:30:00,791 --> 02:30:02,570
shunted away and in the dream the 
category structure loosens,

2739
02:30:02,571 --> 02:30:06,860
which is why dreams are so cute,
but they're experimenting.

2740
02:30:07,010 --> 02:30:12,010
It's your mind is experimenting with the
underlying categorical structure of 

2741
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:16,391
imagination and trying to update your,
your mode of being in the world.

2742
02:30:16,970 --> 02:30:20,120
Dreams often concentrate on things that 
provoke anxiety.

2743
02:30:20,121 --> 02:30:21,680
So if you wake people up when they're 
dreaming,

2744
02:30:21,681 --> 02:30:24,680
the most commonly reported emotion is 
anxiety.

2745
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:30,010
And so the dream is like the first 
stages of the attempt to contend with 

2746
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:34,451
the unknown.
And so the dream is half unknown and 

2747
02:30:34,451 --> 02:30:35,660
half known,
which is also why it's so peculiar,

2748
02:30:35,661 --> 02:30:37,130
you know,
because you kind of understand it,

2749
02:30:37,131 --> 02:30:38,650
but you don't really.
And it,

2750
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:43,710
it,
it partakes of the unknown and of the 

2751
02:30:43,710 --> 02:30:43,710
note and it's the bridge between the 
two,

2752
02:30:43,710 --> 02:30:45,170
something like that.
So,

2753
02:30:54,050 --> 02:30:54,680
um,
okay.

2754
02:30:54,681 --> 02:30:59,681
So my question is kind of two parts.
The first one is just like a general 

2755
02:30:59,681 --> 02:31:00,800
question and then just the application 
of the question.

2756
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:06,100
So my first question is,
do you think that consciousness and 

2757
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:07,100
being hood are inextricably,
inextricably linked?

2758
02:31:07,430 --> 02:31:12,430
And then secondly,
so if there was something like a 

2759
02:31:12,430 --> 02:31:15,550
supercomputer that one could have 
theoretically a perfect brain of a 

2760
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:19,121
person in it,
does that thing then become the same 

2761
02:31:19,121 --> 02:31:20,010
person as the person who was before?
So is

2762
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:23,190
there a transcendence he to be in hood 
but not too conscious.

2763
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:24,780
Okay.
So the first question is,

2764
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:29,810
well,
I would say that the kind of being that 

2765
02:31:29,810 --> 02:31:31,110
these stories are concerned with is 
absolutely dependent on consciousness.

2766
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:36,560
Now whether or not that means that being
as such as dependent on consciousness 

2767
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:37,950
actually depends on how you define Ba.
Right?

2768
02:31:37,951 --> 02:31:41,070
So it's always tricky when you ask an a 
if is a,

2769
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:44,010
an instant,
an example of b.

2770
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:47,070
There was a tricky question because it 
depends on how you define the two,

2771
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:52,280
but for our purposes,
the being that we're discussing that's 

2772
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:55,731
represented in these stories is 
intrinsically associated with conscious 

2773
02:31:55,731 --> 02:31:59,721
experience.
And consciousness is given this 

2774
02:31:59,721 --> 02:32:04,570
constitutive role.
It says that the experience that we're 

2775
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:05,760
talking about would not exist if 
consciousness did not exist.

2776
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:11,150
So you can think about it as a kind of 
game in a way and then you have to 

2777
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:12,150
decide for yourself whether that's a 
game that can be generalized.

2778
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:14,760
And I won't answer the second part.
Okay.

2779
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:15,780
If you don't mind.

2780
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:21,270
Alright.
So two part question.

2781
02:32:22,131 --> 02:32:22,510
First one

2782
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,690
very quick,
almost admin.

2783
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:27,620
If we want to read the biblical stories 
that you're referring to is a particular

2784
02:32:27,621 --> 02:32:28,300
version,
edition,

2785
02:32:28,310 --> 02:32:29,090
source publisher.

2786
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:32,330
Oh,
I'll bring the thing I like next week,

2787
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:35,030
which is a,
I think the reader's digest published it

2788
02:32:35,031 --> 02:32:36,710
of all things,
but it's,

2789
02:32:36,711 --> 02:32:37,960
uh,
it,

2790
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:38,690
it,
it,

2791
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,810
it lays out the narratives in a 
different format.

2792
02:32:41,811 --> 02:32:43,640
It's easy.
I find it much easier to read.

2793
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:46,130
So I'll show it to you and I'll bring it
next time and show it to you.

2794
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:49,990
The main question is one of the main 
reasons why I'm interested in so much of

2795
02:32:49,991 --> 02:32:54,991
your work and I think as well as you 
kind of liberalism at the door and you 

2796
02:32:54,991 --> 02:32:58,711
open up another door to have a much more
deeper meaning in your interview with 

2797
02:32:58,711 --> 02:32:59,370
Trans Liminal media.
You mentioned his eyeballs,

2798
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:03,520
book of the serpent,
the tree and vision,

2799
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:08,880
and you note that we as a species are 
very good at recognizing camouflage 

2800
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:09,850
patterns of snakes,
particularly in the law field of vision.

2801
02:33:10,210 --> 02:33:15,210
And you further note that visual 
acuities is correlated with that and 

2802
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:19,201
that it could bold.
And you summarize that by saying the 

2803
02:33:19,201 --> 02:33:19,201
following.
I'm paraphrasing you.

2804
02:33:19,201 --> 02:33:20,170
You say what gives you vision?
Snakes do.

2805
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:22,960
That's what it says in Genesis.
What else gives you vision?

2806
02:33:22,961 --> 02:33:24,130
Fruit.
That's also right.

2807
02:33:24,490 --> 02:33:26,650
That's why we have color vision.
What makes you self conscious?

2808
02:33:26,651 --> 02:33:28,000
Fear Man,
woman.

2809
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:33,040
That's eve.
And so I understand that the elementary 

2810
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:33,040
level,
some of the concepts that you have about

2811
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:33,160
representations,
dreams,

2812
02:33:33,161 --> 02:33:34,150
abstractions,
et Cetera,

2813
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:36,940
but kind of raises the question for me.
You know,

2814
02:33:36,941 --> 02:33:39,100
I'm not accusing you of any creationism 
or literalism.

2815
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,890
What's your point?
Why did you make that connection?

2816
02:33:41,891 --> 02:33:46,060
What's the meaning of the story of 
Genesis Visa VI Liberals Book?

2817
02:33:46,170 --> 02:33:51,170
No problem.
We're gonna as soon as I get past this 

2818
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:51,840
first,
genesis one,

2819
02:33:51,841 --> 02:33:56,841
we're gonna.
We're gonna hit that hard partly.

2820
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:02,430
Are you at all suggesting that one?

2821
02:34:06,410 --> 02:34:11,410
Yes,
I'm suggesting that it foreshadowed it 

2822
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:12,710
and and I think they're the same thing.
I mean his belt and her books plays with

2823
02:34:12,711 --> 02:34:16,040
that idea metaphorically,
but she never really takes it seriously,

2824
02:34:16,041 --> 02:34:17,230
which is no problem.
I mean,

2825
02:34:17,231 --> 02:34:20,170
there's only so much you can take 
seriously and she did a fine job of what

2826
02:34:20,171 --> 02:34:25,171
you did,
but I'll talk about that a lot because 

2827
02:34:25,171 --> 02:34:25,240
it's a very complicated issue.
I mean,

2828
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:27,000
I would say to begin with that,
the,

2829
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:32,490
that,
the systems that you use to deal with 

2830
02:34:32,490 --> 02:34:34,390
radical uncertainty or the same systems 
that you're primate ancestors evolved to

2831
02:34:34,391 --> 02:34:37,060
deal with snakes.
That's a good start.

2832
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:38,990
So.
Okay.

2833
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:40,720
One more and then we're done.

2834
02:34:45,020 --> 02:34:50,020
I'm an aerospace science engineer and an
expert computer programmer and I have 

2835
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:51,230
three rapid fire questions,
so I'm going to get through quick.

2836
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:56,980
Based on your opinion of where the 
university is now standing in terms of 

2837
02:34:56,980 --> 02:35:00,851
humanities and social sciences,
is mathematics more powerful than 

2838
02:35:00,891 --> 02:35:02,330
articulated speech?

2839
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:10,830
I'm not sure.
I'm not exactly sure how the more 

2840
02:35:10,830 --> 02:35:12,970
powerful to study mathematics and 
science in university.

2841
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:16,600
Well,
it depends on what you mean by power,

2842
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:21,960
I guess.
I mean obviously studying mathematics 

2843
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:22,420
and computer science makes you insanely 
powerful.

2844
02:35:22,421 --> 02:35:27,421
The question is to what end,
and I don't think that you can extract 

2845
02:35:27,421 --> 02:35:28,840
an answer to that from the study of 
mathematics.

2846
02:35:28,841 --> 02:35:32,320
The humanities are there to ground 
people in proper citizen hood.

2847
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:34,720
That's,
that's a way of thinking about it and so

2848
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:36,190
yes,
it makes you powerful,

2849
02:35:36,191 --> 02:35:38,740
but then the question is who has the 
power?

2850
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:42,370
Because it might not be you,
it might be the mathematics,

2851
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:43,870
so to speak,
you know,

2852
02:35:43,871 --> 02:35:48,840
because you never know what you're an 
agent of precisely and so harvest.

2853
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:49,900
Yeah.
Well look,

2854
02:35:49,901 --> 02:35:51,790
I've got nothing against computer 
programmers.

2855
02:35:51,791 --> 02:35:54,370
I mean more power to you guys and 
mathematicians as well,

2856
02:35:54,371 --> 02:35:58,670
but the tool,
so it has to be a two,

2857
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,690
right?
It has to be a tool.

2858
02:36:00,691 --> 02:36:05,691
I'll have something and what the 
humanities were forward to take was to 

2859
02:36:05,691 --> 02:36:09,070
tell people what the tools shouldn't be 
used for and so the tools themselves are

2860
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:11,490
crazily powerful,
but that's,

2861
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:13,600
that's not necessarily,
you know,

2862
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:15,670
an,
an untrammeled good.

2863
02:36:15,940 --> 02:36:20,040
So I have to stop because.
Okay.

2864
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:20,410
Quick.

2865
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:25,270
You want to answer this question?
Okay.

2866
02:36:25,490 --> 02:36:30,490
You were in this I guess one room in a 
museum in New York seeing some original 

2867
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:34,841
renaissance art work masterpiece.
These are generally accepted as amazing 

2868
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:35,810
artifacts.

2869
02:36:35,890 --> 02:36:36,100
Okay.

2870
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:45,650
Does a,
an original work of art as opposed to a 

2871
02:36:45,650 --> 02:36:49,101
high fidelity reproduction contained the
spirit of the artist who created it and 

2872
02:36:49,321 --> 02:36:52,820
does this account for the disparity and 
how much you'd have to pay for it.

2873
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:56,990
It does impart a good portrait artist.
And uh,

2874
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:02,280
one of the things he pointed out about a
great portrait is that it actually 

2875
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:02,770
contains time.
So you know,

2876
02:37:02,771 --> 02:37:07,771
because a photograph is one instant,
but a portrait is you layered on,

2877
02:37:07,871 --> 02:37:10,750
you layered on you late.
So it's gonna thickness,

2878
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:11,480
you know,
when there,

2879
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:14,170
I think you can see that thickness in 
the original,

2880
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:18,320
but it's also a direct manifestation of 
that creative act of perception.

2881
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:23,620
And I don't think you get that.
You just can't get the fidelity of the 

2882
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:27,881
original with the reproduction.
But there's more to it than that too 

2883
02:37:27,881 --> 02:37:28,340
because the painting doesn't end with 
the frame.

2884
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:33,670
You know,
like we tend to think of the painting 

2885
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:33,670
itself as the object,
but,

2886
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:37,450
but most objects are,
are densely innervated with hisd with 

2887
02:37:37,450 --> 02:37:39,470
historical context.
And you can say,

2888
02:37:39,471 --> 02:37:41,780
well the historical context isn't the 
object,

2889
02:37:41,781 --> 02:37:43,940
but it depends on what you mean by the 
object.

2890
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:49,210
And often people when they buy a piece 
of a painting are buying the historical 

2891
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,200
context and you just don't get that with
the reproduction.

2892
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:53,180
It's a kind of magic.
It's like,

2893
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:58,360
do you want to have Elvis Presley's 
guitar or another guitar just like it 

2894
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:02,470
while you want to have Elvis's guitar.
It's why you can't tell it's Elvis's 

2895
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:02,810
guitar by looking at it.

2896
02:38:06,970 --> 02:38:11,970
Perfect reproduction.
Well,

2897
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:15,500
it is at the level of detail,
but not at the level of context.

2898
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:17,180
That's how it looks to me.
Okay.

2899
02:38:17,181 --> 02:38:17,870
We gotta go.

2900
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:24,580
Thank you.
