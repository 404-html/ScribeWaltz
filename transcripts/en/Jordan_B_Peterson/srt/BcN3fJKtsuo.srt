1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,050
Well,
I won't

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
back down,
you can stand up at the gates of hell,

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,020
but I won't.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,200
In the first video I posted this 
morning,

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,034
I read a letter from a variety of 
student activist groups calling for my 

6
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,490
silencing apology and discipline.
In this video,

7
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:31,930
I'm going to read a similar letter from 
a branch of the Canadian Union of public

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:36,931
employees asking for similar measures.
And so this is the second letter.

9
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:40,810
This is from the Canadian Union of 
public employees.

10
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,644
Actually,
it's from one branch of the Canadian 

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,700
Union of public employees.
Um,

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,933
I should also note that another 
president of the Canadian Union of 

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,820
public employees actually came and 
talked to me yesterday on,

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,723
on something unrelated to this about his
fear that the new university sexual 

15
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,160
harassment policy is so broad and so 
wide that it risks,

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,083
uh,
turning normal misunderstandings into 

17
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:07,480
career destroying a debacle.
And so,

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,460
so I'm just telling you that so that you
know that,

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,390
you know,
there's not homogeneity on the left and,

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,373
and there's not homogenous eat within 
the Canadian Union public employees 

21
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:16,900
either.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,220
But anyways,
here's what they want.

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,923
Jordan Peterson's comments.
Make the U of t a hostile place to work 

24
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:26,830
and study as queer people who study and 
work at the University of Toronto.

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,903
We have the right to fully access all 
the resources of the university without 

26
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,934
fear.
We have the right to enter and 

27
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,550
participate in every classroom,
every lab,

28
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,020
library,
athletic facility,

29
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,854
in event space,
and we have the right to participate as 

30
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:38,224
ourselves.
We have the right to go to work and be 

31
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,134
treated with dignity and respect.
We know no one and explanation of much 

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,390
less a defense of our gender or 
sexuality.

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,253
We sit insist on a truth,
so simple that it shouldn't need to be 

34
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,464
stated that we have not.
Psychology professor has who has never 

35
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,720
met us are the authorities on our own 
identities and yes,

36
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,554
we have the right to be recognized and 
referred to as we are in the ways we 

37
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,280
choose reviews to low.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,450
Anyone.
Least of all,

39
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,284
someone who could be our professor or 
our work supervisor to the side that he 

40
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,840
knows better who we are and what is the 
right way to refer to us.

41
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,160
If insisting on this kind of recognition
seems petty or an unimportant to som,

42
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:12,994
we remind them of our long and 
continuing struggle as queer people to 

43
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:18,400
gain the same rights,
freedoms and recognitions enjoyed by CIS

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,960
straight people.
CIS.

45
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,550
That's a word I really don't like.
By the way we remind that's manufactured

46
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:28,210
word and that's exactly the kind of word
that I not ever going to be compelled to

47
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,000
say.
We remind them that for us going to work

48
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,210
already involves daily Calculus,
situation by situation,

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,030
colleague by calling of what and how 
much of ourselves to reveal.

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,313
We have to remain conscious of all at 
all times of the details of our lives 

51
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:42,190
that may make us physically unsafe.

52
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,023
Prompt,
humiliating questions lead to social 

53
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,394
alienation or takeaway our chance next 
employment contract we desperately need 

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,140
in this city in 2016.
It is not safe to be a queer person.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,993
That's why we had a month long pride 
festival last year and it is especially 

56
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
safe to be a trans or gender 
nonconforming person at the University 

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,813
of Toronto.
Our commitment must not only be to 

58
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,610
protect,
but to affirm and elevate our colleagues

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,980
who faced discrimination in danger in 
their daily lives.

60
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,340
We should be proactive in inviting,
recognizing that the default expectation

61
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,280
for queer people is that we will not be 
welcomed in new environments.

62
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,114
We entered and stand reason comments by 
professor Jordan Peterson have 

63
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,580
communicated that in some parts of our 
working lives,

64
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,160
trans and gender nonconforming people 
are not welcome,

65
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,280
that will be denied basic recognition of
our humanity,

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,263
that we will be called delusional and 
lectured to and that a potential 

67
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,534
supervisor will be given authority to 
decide who we really are and how we 

68
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,564
should be referred to at work in our 
unions will view this situation 

69
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,034
constitutes a clear and unacceptable 
violation of our human rights and our 

70
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,934
workplace rights.

71
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,773
It has also a violation of the 
collective agreements we negotiate with 

72
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,910
the university to set the terms and 
expectations of our working lives.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,073
These collective agreements guarantee US
protection from quote verbal conduct or 

74
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,020
other forms of communication that 
emphasize the sex,

75
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,854
sexuality or gender identity or 
expression of an employee in a manner 

76
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,650
that the actor,
uh,

77
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,640
he Jordan Peterson knows or ought 
reasonably to know,

78
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,840
is unwelcome or creates an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working or learning

79
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,674
environment.
Professor Peterson ought reasonably to 

80
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:14,890
know that refusing to his dress,
his students and his tds as they request

81
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,680
to be addressed and deriding their 
identities in public by.

82
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,514
I have no idea what,
what that means is unwelcome behavior 

83
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,844
that makes his classroom,
his department and his university 

84
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,420
intimidating,
hostile or offensive for us.

85
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,013
The UFT administration ought reasonably 
to know that when comments are made 

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,483
public,
they need to be swiftly and 

87
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,344
categorically condemned and appropriate 
actions need to be taken to restore a 

88
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,080
workplace free of intimidation and 
hostility.

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,303
But in case any of our managers and 
supervisors didn't understand that 

90
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,454
actions like professor Peterson's and 
the silence of the university 

91
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,040
administration in response are 
unwelcomed,

92
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,680
hostile and offensive.
Let us be the ones to tell you they are.

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,573
And now you know,
we expect and demand better and our 

94
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,280
union will be organizing and acting 
accordingly.

95
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,620
Sincerely,
qp three,

96
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,281
nine,
zero.

97
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,310
Two Queer Caucus,
Canadian Union of public employees.

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,890
Local three nine.
Oh,

99
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,950
two.
So if you're looking for something to do

100
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:09,784
to help you could write a letter to the 
individuals whose emails I have posted 

101
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,323
in the information box and the 
description box that that is associated 

102
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,334
with this video.
So email them and email all of them and 

103
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,910
send me a copy if you want.
That would be helpful.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,910
Be particularly useful if it came from 
students.

105
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,950
Thanks very much.
Bye.

106
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,784
Bye.
