1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:00,951
Hey,
how's it going,

2
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:03,770
everyone?
So today I have a very special guest,

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,420
Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson.

4
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:06,254
He's a professor of psychology at the 
University of Toronto and a practicing 

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,530
clinical psychologist.
And I want to read just a,

6
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,350
just a little bit of,
um,

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,871
of,
of,

8
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,600
of paragraph,
just a little piece from his,

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,800
his arm,
his own website.

10
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,923
And Jordan Peterson has published more 
than a hundred scientific papers 

11
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:23,924
transforming the modern understanding of
personality and revolutionizing the 

12
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:30,290
psychology of religion and his now 
classic book maps of meaning.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,230
They're the architecture of belief as a 
Harvard professor,

14
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,064
he was nominated for the prestigious 
Levinson teaching prize and is regarded 

15
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:37,814
by his current University of Toronto 
students as one of the three truly life 

16
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:42,530
changing teachers.
Uh,

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,693
Dr. Peterson.
Thank you for coming on and tiering 

18
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:46,341
that.
Is it,

19
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,174
is it safe to say,
is it fair to say that you are 

20
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,420
considered a rock star now?

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,660
Well,
my youtube channel seems to be,

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,180
have become very popular.
And uh,

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,910
I've been,
yeah,

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,650
I mean I hate to use that 
characterization,

25
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,760
you know,
but,

26
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:04,840
um,
yeah,

27
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:08,450
there's been an explosion of media 
interest and then public interest in the

28
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,284
sorts of things that not only the sorts 
of things that I've been dealing with 

29
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,800
say sort of philosophically and 
politically,

30
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,634
but also in the,
in the lectures that I'm putting up for 

31
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,630
people on,
on Youtube,

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,480
which I'd been doing for about about 
four years now.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,100
And I think it's the combination of the 
stance that I took on,

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,113
on compelled speech and,
and on political correctness in general 

35
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,194
and also the content that I've been 
provided with the people that they come 

36
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,290
to the channel for the,
for the political controversy,

37
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,510
I suppose.
And they seem to stay for the content.

38
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,160
So that's pretty,
it's been,

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,690
it's remarkable.
I mean,

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,750
I don't know what to make of it.
It's,

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,653
it's remarkable.

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Yeah.
You like it.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,290
There's been like a,
a shift of people wanting to,

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,110
they like,
they want to hear stuff like this.

45
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,944
They're,
they're really excited to hear like a 

46
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,990
position of free speech when,
when,

47
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,970
when a lot of people actually have been 
kind of railing against it.

48
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,850
And um,
it's really interesting the type,

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
the Times that we're in because 
unfortunately it's coming from a lot of 

50
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:11,050
people on the far left.
There's like this a Torah,

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,140
a authoritarian left type of movement 
taking a foot.

52
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,003
And that's basically war.
Most people kind of a recognized you 

53
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,250
from because they saw a protest,
uh,

54
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,980
that was going on at your university,
um,

55
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,050
about,
and it was about a bill see 16.

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,463
Yeah,
that's right.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,441
That's right.
Yeah.

58
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,530
Well cause I made a video that,
that where I,

59
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,663
I expressed my opposition to the go.
The Canadian government's attempts to 

60
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:42,361
make certain kinds of speech mandatory 
and also our to oppose the University of

61
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,880
Toronto Human Resources Departments,
attempts to impose,

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,770
uh,
what I regard as inappropriate and,

63
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,020
and likely harmful so-called unconscious
anti bias retraining on the,

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,870
of their,
uh,

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
human resources employees,
which I think is a very dangerous 

66
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,770
incursion into the civil rights of,
of,

67
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,480
of their staff as well as being based on
very poor science in my estimation.

68
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,520
So yeah,
people,

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,930
people,
people,

70
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,764
uh,
there was a protest as a consequence of 

71
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
that and that got a lot of attention on 
youtube and that was one of the things 

72
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,610
that drew a lot of attention to my 
channel.

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,893
So,

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,121
yeah,
absolutely.

75
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,130
I mean it's what,
it's how I found you.

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,073
It's um,
I actually did a video on it and I saw 

77
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,680
that you tweeted it out,
so I was actually like,

78
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,230
oh,
he,

79
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,240
he,
he seen it.

80
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:34,260
And I,
I feel,

81
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,620
I feel strange because I'm like the type
of content I make.

82
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:41,280
I try to be a very lighthearted,
I tried to have people,

83
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,114
I try to be a crack a lot of jokes and 
have people at least have some fun 

84
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:49,170
through through the madness.
So when I was also like seeing that,

85
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:49,621
I was like,
oh,

86
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,454
I wonder,
I wonder what he thinks because I don't 

87
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:53,270
know,

88
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,820
I got a real kick out of your,
out of your coverage.

89
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,683
I thought it was really funny.
And it's funny because some of the best 

90
00:03:58,491 --> 00:03:59,324
conversations that I've had with people 
on Youtube so far have been with people 

91
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:02,864
who have,
uh,

92
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,420
who are,
who have a background in comedy,

93
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,254
roughly speaking.
And I think it's partly because people 

94
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:08,954
who have a good sense of humor and who 
have a comical take on things are also 

95
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:12,644
likely to tell the truth because there's
almost nothing funnier than telling the 

96
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,011
truth.
Right.

97
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,470
If you say things that other people 
think but won't say,

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,760
then you know,
there that often makes it very funny.

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,900
And I thought you're,
oh,

100
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,660
I think your general very comical and 
wedding so

101
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,580
well that,
that,

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,570
that I appreciate that a lot because,
yeah,

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,111
like,
uh,

104
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:32,890
I don't know,
hearing,

105
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,850
hearing,
stuff like that.

106
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,350
Sometimes I'm like doubting myself.
I don't know.

107
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,130
I'm like,
should I,

108
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,390
should I try to be more,
cause,

109
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,583
excuse me.
Um,

110
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,700
I'm in,
I'm kind of,

111
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,380
I guess I've been shoved in this,
uh,

112
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,500
this community called this skeptic 
community on Youtube.

113
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,910
And,
um,

114
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,670
I,
I,

115
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,580
I do try to be skeptical,
but at the same time,

116
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:49,414
like I said,
I tried to be more just on the comedic 

117
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,304
side.
I was thinking about being more serious 

118
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,720
and try to be like,
say more respected,

119
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,890
I guess in the,
in the,

120
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,130
in the community that I'm in.
But I kind of want to just,

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,481
I was like,
no,

122
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:01,721
no,
no,

123
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,290
no.
There's,

124
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,850
there's enough people.
I don't know if you're,

125
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,080
um,
if you watch,

126
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:05,914
say if there's any,
any youtubers and taking in particular 

127
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,310
that you watch,
I don't know if you've,

128
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,144
uh,
seen say anyone like Sargon of a cod or 

129
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,720
armored skeptic.
Yeah.

130
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,500
And,
um,

131
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,333
have you had any

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm going to be on star gone show and 
in,

133
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,100
in the relatively near future

134
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,230
I suspected that much.
Um,

135
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,280
especially he just did a video about it.
I saw it,

136
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,121
um,
recently.

137
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,954
And that was actually something that I 
wanted to ask you about cause he was 

138
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,720
talking about mcmaster university and 
um,

139
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,030
and that's actually something that I 
wanted to,

140
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,983
I really,
I was really interested in and knowing 

141
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,200
like say,
um,

142
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,034
was this,
how do you like you officially like on 

143
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,003
you just like a target now we're now 
you're being shut down where we've seen 

144
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,134
it happen to other people,
people that like say the Milo 

145
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,961
Yiannopoulos,
but you know,

146
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:53,490
he's a,
I can say a provocateur and so it's,

147
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,324
it's very telling that they would go out
of their way just to shut you down when 

148
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,950
I know it just seems like you're not 
saying anything that is irrational.

149
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,460
You're not saying anything that is even 
remotely extreme.

150
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,563
And a,
I just wanted to get your take on how 

151
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,990
did you feel when,
when you got,

152
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,040
when you got your,
your,

153
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,040
um,
shutdown at all?

154
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,703
Because when I was there,
I didn't really think of it as being 

155
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,100
shut down.
Um,

156
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,153
and the reason for that is because 
things aren't exactly what they appear 

157
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,620
to be anymore.
And so for example,

158
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,454
now when I go and talk at places,
the place I'm talking out is barely the 

159
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,990
place where the event is happening at 
all.

160
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,273
The real event happens on Youtube.
And so I went there and I saw all these 

161
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:43,391
people acting in a very,
what would you say?

162
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,950
Well,
it was partly a,

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,510
a vulgar manner because they were 
yelling things at me that were,

164
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,870
um,
just,

165
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,310
they just Asinine,
just,

166
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,890
they're not the sorts of things that 
you'd expect.

167
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,560
Even protestors who had any sense to be 
shouting.

168
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,943
They're,
they're,

169
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,790
they're just,
they're just low rent insults,

170
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,624
you know,
low grade insults and behaving very 

171
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:13,061
badly and laughing about it and on their
cell phones and misbehaving in a,

172
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,980
in a very bad way.

173
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,450
And,
and having the goal,

174
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,284
for example,
to appear at the mcmaster talk behind a 

175
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,990
huge banner with a hammer and sickle on 
it.

176
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,550
Like,
as far as I'm concerned,

177
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,260
I really mean this.
There is no difference between appearing

178
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:34,130
behind a banner with a hammer and sickle
on it and appearing behind a banner with

179
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,964
a swastika on it.
And the fact that you can get away with 

180
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,920
that at a university and that that's 
considered,

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,913
uh,
what would you describe it as a 

182
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,634
reasonable stance in the aftermath of 
the events of the 20th century where we 

183
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,284
know that at least a hundred million 
people were killed by communist 

184
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,030
totalitarianism is absolutely 
reprehensible.

185
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,610
But when I was at mass mcmaster,
I thought,

186
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,890
and I thought this ever since that 
first,

187
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,370
that first protest where I,
where I was shouted down,

188
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,253
increasingly the appropriate thing to do
when surrounded by protesters is to 

189
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:12,080
document it and let them,
let them destroy their own credibility.

190
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,113
And so far,
virtually every time I've had an 

191
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:20,771
encounter with the radical social 
justice types and I just let them be,

192
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,170
which,
which is I think a reasonable approach.

193
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,350
They've undermined their own position 
dreadfully.

194
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,680
And so I don't think of it being as 
being shut down at all.

195
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:34,580
I just think about it as another route 
to victory and even an effective route.

196
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,414
Cause I may be 150,000 people have 
watched that protest now at mcmaster 

197
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,110
university may be more far more people 
than were at the event itself.

198
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,143
So

199
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,281
No.
Yeah,

200
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,260
you're absolutely right.
It,

201
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
it actually,
I mean it wouldn't,

202
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,870
this stuff does happen.
It does bring,

203
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:50,704
it brings these issues to light and it 
shows just how ridiculous these people 

204
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:56,220
are acting and showing that like you,
you take them seriously.

205
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,054
And I 100% agree about the,
the hammer and sickle thing like 100% 

206
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,430
because,
um,

207
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,670
especially when you see what's been 
happening at say for instance,

208
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,504
like trump rallies around the United 
States where a lot of these people that 

209
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,720
consider themselves a communists or 
Marxists or whatever,

210
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,733
or um,
antifascist they're just just beating 

211
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,680
the hell out of people in the,
in the name of fighting fascism.

212
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,790
It's,
it's the most,

213
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,470
it's the most like,
it's the most ironic thing that I,

214
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,280
I've,
I've witnessed in quite a while.

215
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,290
It's,
it's pretty,

216
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,960
it's pretty sad.
It's pretty sad to be honest.

217
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:31,560
But,
um,

218
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,060
like you said though,
people are,

219
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,840
um,
and just in droves is just trying to shy

220
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,310
away from that and be like,
this is not,

221
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,560
this is not the way to go.
And so yeah,

222
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,270
it actually is a very good thing that,
you know,

223
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,104
will say there's the silver lining for 
you getting screeched at and shouted 

224
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,710
down and everything.
It's,

225
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:47,980
it's

226
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,980
a massive silver lining because now I'm 
in a situation that I suspect is very

227
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,210
frustrating for those who are opposing 
what I'm doing,

228
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:01,540
where if I go speak somewhere and there 
are no protestors,

229
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,613
then I get to speak and I'll get a 
viewing of a couple of hundred thousand 

230
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,520
people.
And if I go somewhere and I don't get to

231
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,354
speak,
then that gets a viewing of a couple of 

232
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,533
hundred thousand people.
And so at the moment I'm in this 

233
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,594
extraordinarily fortunate position where
as long as I don't do anything to 

234
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:23,650
unforgivably stupid and get carried away
or get arrogant or anything like that,

235
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,513
that um,
as long as I've cautious as if I keep 

236
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,554
pushing forward with what I'm doing,
then I seem to come out in a positive 

237
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,940
light either way.
And that's a great position to be in.

238
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,000
It's an amazing position to be in an 
eye.

239
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,923
It's also been,
I've learned some really interesting 

240
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,250
things here as well.

241
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,083
So one of the things that's happened,
you were talking about my youtube 

242
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,060
popularity,
I can tell you some details about that,

243
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,820
that you might be interested in.
First of all,

244
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,613
the overwhelming majority of the people 
who come to see me live and who are 

245
00:10:57,161 --> 00:11:01,720
watching my youtube videos are men.
It's about 90% men.

246
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,554
And you know,
you might think that that's because my 

247
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:06,640
political stance say it doesn't 
necessarily appeal to women,

248
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:08,140
but I don't think that that's what it 
is.

249
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:11,680
Because when I looked at the 
demographics for my lectures,

250
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:12,514
my personality lectures in my other 
university lectures that I put online 

251
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:20,521
since 2013 even before this political 
issue became central,

252
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,550
let's say about 85% of the people who 
were watching my lectures were men.

253
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,283
And that's strange because about 75% of 
psychology students in universities are 

254
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:33,994
female now.
And so I've been trying to figure out 

255
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:37,024
why is it that men are coming to watch 
me and why is it that men are watching 

256
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:44,821
my lectures and what I,
so I've been speaking to these audiences

257
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:45,724
about a variety of different things and 
I've been concentrating mostly on the 

258
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,340
right to free speech,
um,

259
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,160
and in an apolitical,
in some sense,

260
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
like I'm making the case that it's 
necessary for free speech to be placed 

261
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:03,670
above all other political virtue so that
no matter who it is,

262
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,160
no matter who positioned that's being 
put forward,

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,580
they have an opportunity to engage in 
political dialogue.

264
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,163
But also I've been talking an awful lot 
about responsibility and responsibility 

265
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,770
is the other half of rights,
right?

266
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,604
Because your rights are my 
responsibility and my rights are your 

267
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,234
responsibility.
And so you actually can't have a 

268
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,124
discussion about rights without having a
discussion about responsibility unless 

269
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,800
you're willing to forget about half of 
the story.

270
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,323
And the radical leftists in particular.
And even the moderates I would say have 

271
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:36,244
been pushing this idea that the quality 
of life that someone enjoys is entirely 

272
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:42,484
dependent on the rights that they are 
granted or the rights that they take to 

273
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,384
themselves.
And I have been putting forward the 

274
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,790
counter story,
which is,

275
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,653
well just hold on a minute there guys.
You should be concentrating more on 

276
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,423
responsibility that you should be 
upholding in the community and getting 

277
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,934
your act together as individuals and 
living in a way that makes you valuable 

278
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:01,894
to your family and to your,
to the broader community and learning 

279
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,284
how to bear a heavy load,
like a civilized human being and the 

280
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,450
man,
the young man,

281
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,440
man,
they are so hungry for that message.

282
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,630
Just,
just unbelievable.

283
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,480
Their eyes light up.
And you know,

284
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,343
I,
I've got this program that I wanted to 

285
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,480
talk to you about too.
Uh,

286
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,950
I designed this program a while back 
called future authoring.

287
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,503
And that's available@selfauthoring.com.
And it's a program that helps people 

288
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,210
write out a plan for their life three to
five years down the road.

289
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:38,380
And so what the program asks you some 
questions it asks you,

290
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,203
okay?
So imagine that you were taking care of 

291
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,960
yourself like you're someone that you 
were cared for.

292
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,670
So you're,
you're,

293
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,160
you're trying to set your life up so 
that you have a good,

294
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,900
high quality,
valuable life.

295
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,900
However you want to define that.
That's up to you to define it,

296
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,780
um,
in Eros to think about,

297
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,400
well,
what do you want from your friends?

298
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,180
Or Hoe do you want your friends to be?
What do you want for your career?

299
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,433
How are you going to educate yourself?
How can you use your time in a high 

300
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,930
quality and productive way outside of,
uh,

301
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,610
outside of your obligations?
Um,

302
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,610
how are you going to handle drugs and 
alcohol?

303
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,943
Um,
what do you want for an intimate 

304
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,484
relationship?
How are you going to structure your 

305
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,200
family?
You know,

306
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,034
the,
the basic can take about that as the 

307
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,790
basic dimensions of a,
of a functional life.

308
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,540
So the question is,
if you could have what you wanted,

309
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,610
what would that look like?
And assuming what,

310
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,553
what you wanted was also best for you,
you know that you were heading in a 

311
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,090
positive direction.
So you're asked to think about that.

312
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,283
And then you're asked to write for 15 
minutes without too much concern for 

313
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:38,824
grammar or structure about what your 
life could be like three to five years 

314
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,280
down the road if it was set up in a 
manner that you would find optimal.

315
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,760
And then you're asked to write a counter
position,

316
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:52,100
which is all right.
So think about yourself critically for a

317
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,933
minute.
And then imagine that you let your bad 

318
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,810
habits and your resentment and your 
hatred and,

319
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,570
and everything about you that's,
that's subpar.

320
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,413
It's suboptimal.
Get the upper hand and it augured into 

321
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:04,754
the ground.
What sort of hell would you be in three 

322
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:07,484
to five years down the road?
And so we basically imagine you specify 

323
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,560
a heaven that you can strive for and it 
held that you want to avoid.

324
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,050
And that sets you up for maximum 
motivation a cause.

325
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,884
You're running towards something you 
want and you're running away from 

326
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,224
something you don't want.
And then you're asked to lay out an 

327
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:28,130
implementable plan and to come up with 
detailed rationale for what you're going

328
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,180
to pursue.
So,

329
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,830
okay,
so that's all a long story.

330
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,664
But we've tested this program and a 
number of universities in Europe and in 

331
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,840
North America,
and we found the same thing each time.

332
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,500
We found that it,
it works better for,

333
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,660
for students who are doing worse.
It's not just for students,

334
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,494
by the way,
but we've tested it in students because 

335
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,744
it was,
it was an easy population to actually 

336
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,380
assess its effectiveness.
And so,

337
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,963
um,
we found that it increased student's 

338
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,204
grade point average by about 25% and 
decreased the probability that they 

339
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:03,760
would drop out of university by about 
25% so about,

340
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,603
so huge effect.
But what was really cool was that the 

341
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:08,924
biggest effect was on men.
And if you look in the universities now 

342
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,580
and it schools for that matter,
women are outperforming men.

343
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,700
Definitely.
And I think it's because of the men.

344
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,610
Well I,
we don't have to get into why that is,

345
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:23,444
but they are.
But if they do the future authoring 

346
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,080
program,
the men catch up.

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,000
And then here's the kicker.
This is,

348
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,670
this is something I think is absolutely 
fascinating.

349
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,960
So when we did our,
our big study in Holland,

350
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,750
I worked with a woman there named 
Mikayla shippers.

351
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,210
And uh,
uh,

352
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,520
another professor named Ad Cheaper's and
we ran about 7,000 students through this

353
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,600
program now.
And then we broke them up,

354
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,160
not only buy,
buy,

355
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,620
buy sex,
but also by ethnicity.

356
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,053
And so we broke them into male and 
female and also Dutch national and no 

357
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:03,020
one western ethnic minority.
And then we looked at,

358
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,020
at their initial performance before they
did the program.

359
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:10,460
And so the higher performing people 
where the Dutch women and then the Dutch

360
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,293
Dutchmen and then the non Western ethnic
minority women and then the non Western 

361
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,560
ethnic minority men who were out 
underperforming the Dutch women by about

362
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,394
70%.
So a huge margin and dropping out far 

363
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,610
more frequently.
When they did the program,

364
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,503
the nonwestern ethnic minority men 
caught up to the Dutch women and passed 

365
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,900
them within two years.

366
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,570
And then we,
no kidding,

367
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,950
man,
that just blew me away.

368
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,810
And so like,
cause that's,

369
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,190
that's so unlikely,
right?

370
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,053
Usually when you,
when you produce an intervention that's 

371
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,660
designed to improve things,
first of all,

372
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:48,500
it usually fails.
Sometimes it makes things worse.

373
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,370
And even if it does succeed,
what usually happens is,

374
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,660
is it makes the higher performing people
do even better.

375
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,740
But that isn't what this did.
What it did was take the people who were

376
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,843
doing the worst and it increased their 
performance up to the point where they 

377
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,950
were indistinguishable from the high 
performers.

378
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,563
And so,
so there's a bunch of things about that 

379
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,874
that's interesting in the first is that 
people make the claim all the time that 

380
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,030
say in European communities that if 
you're a visible minority,

381
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,780
the reason that you're not attaining the
same,

382
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,820
uh,
accomplishment level,

383
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,683
let's say,
is because of sociological or political 

384
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,500
or economic reasons.

385
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,053
But we produced a psychological 
intervention that helped people get 

386
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:30,714
their acts together at the individual 
level to set concrete goals for 

387
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,480
themselves that they want it and that 
removed the effects.

388
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,800
And so that's one of the things I wanted
to talk to you about because you know,

389
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,530
among your listeners there are going to 
be people of,

390
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,463
of all sorts who are drifting and,
and a lot of what I'm doing when I'm 

391
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,720
talking to live audiences as an on 
youtube is to,

392
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,763
is to tell people,
help people figure out how to get their 

393
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,990
act together and aim at what they want.
But what it,

394
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,883
what seems to be the case is if you can 
get men to sit down and think about how 

395
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:03,264
they can take responsibility for what 
they want in a way that would also 

396
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:06,954
simultaneously benefit the community.
Their performance goes way up and their 

397
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,840
quality of life improves and their 
mental health improves.

398
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,673
And,
and I've got like hundreds of letters 

399
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,343
now from people who have listened to the
lectures or done that program and said 

400
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,001
that,
you know,

401
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,670
it's turned their life around and 
stopped them from being nihilistic.

402
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,593
Stop them from wasting their time 
constantly and doing foolish things and 

403
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,130
set them on a path that they regard as 
much as much more powerful.

404
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,420
That's the thing too,
it's,

405
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,393
it's not that,
the other thing that isn't taught to 

406
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,960
young men now is that the reason you get
your act together so that you have power

407
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,760
and influence,
right?

408
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:46,080
So you get strong and indomitable and so
that nobody can get in your way.

409
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,840
And I don't mean that you become a cruel
monster.

410
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,920
Although being able to be a cruel 
monster is actually extremely useful,

411
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,113
but doesn't mean you should be one.
But being able to be one is means that 

412
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,000
you're no pushover and who you know,
you're,

413
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:02,520
what kind of man are you.
If you're a pushover,

414
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,030
you're hearing you're not good for 
yourself or anyone else.

415
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,730
So anyway,
so that's been very exciting.

416
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,090
Yeah,
it sounds amazing.

417
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,310
The results are just like,
that's,

418
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,410
that's fantastic.
Like hearing that stuff.

419
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:16,244
And I,
and I totally understand that and it's 

420
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,510
something that,
say for example,

421
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,344
it's something that I kind of would need
where I was even telling one of my 

422
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,210
friends the other day that,
you know,

423
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:26,990
I'm like,
you will,

424
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,400
you'll,
you'll succeed much better,

425
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,890
especially if you have something mapped 
out.

426
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,890
Like if you have it,
if you actually can physically see it,

427
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,630
if you not just like,
you know,

428
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,250
thinking about and you're bouncing all 
over the place.

429
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:38,084
It's something that I've,
I would do a lot and say recently I've 

430
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,170
been say,
okay,

431
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,510
I want to get better physically and 
mentally,

432
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,020
especially physically.
And uh,

433
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,870
I've just been kind of all over the 
place in war.

434
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:50,561
I was just like,
okay,

435
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,394
I need to sit down and I really need to 
figure out what I'm going to do and I 

436
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,680
need to,
I need to actually just write it out.

437
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,990
And this is,
this is the type of food I'm gonna eat.

438
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,240
This is all this legwork.
When I can actually see it.

439
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,240
Like it's so much,
it's easier to,

440
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,690
to just obtain,
it's so much easier to like,

441
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,850
it's,
it's not just,

442
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,470
I dunno,
like I always just feel like saying your

443
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:09,580
head,
you have so many thoughts.

444
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:10,414
So it's hard to just lock on to one 
thing though when you can actually just 

445
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,500
like focus on to something like that.
Um,

446
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,543
like this program that you have,
it sounds exactly what a lot of people 

447
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,100
would need.
Sounds like something that like my,

448
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:22,480
my friend that I hang out with,
um,

449
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,050
like,
um,

450
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,390
every week it sounds like something that
he can really benefit from.

451
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:27,220
So,
and I'm sure he'll watch this because he

452
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,070
actually does watch my channel.
He's like,

453
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,913
he's a good guy.

454
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,873
I think what I'll do is maybe what I'll 
do is I'll set up a discount code for 

455
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,804
your viewers and I'll send you that.
You can put it in the lake and your 

456
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,740
youtube video link.
Oh,

457
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:40,574
definitely.
Yeah,

458
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,510
that would be good.
And I'll send you a couple of codes to,

459
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,740
and if you feel like,
if you,

460
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,870
if you're inclined to do the program,
if you're interested,

461
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,210
maybe we can have a conversation about 
it after you're done.

462
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,741
Yeah,
I'll give it a shot,

463
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,371
man.
I mean,

464
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:52,204
I,
I'm sure I could benefit from it myself 

465
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,820
if,
especially my,

466
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,340
my,
my audience knows how,

467
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,530
um,
how chaotic my life has been.

468
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,420
How,
um,

469
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,761
they,
they,

470
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:03,580
they never know what setting I'm going 
to have in the background because I move

471
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,530
around so much and I'm,
I mean,

472
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,060
I'm just,
I'm just trying to,

473
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,340
you know,
I'm,

474
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,110
I'm figuring things out as I go do and 
I'm very open and honest,

475
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,450
so I never,
I don't know.

476
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,293
I never,
I never tried to hide the fact that I 

477
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,071
just like,
oh,

478
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:15,940
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm,

479
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:16,631
I'm,
I'm,

480
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,190
I'm getting pretty old.
I mean,

481
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,980
I'm not old,
but I mean it just to a standard of,

482
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,590
I shouldn't be bouncing from place to 
place because I'm,

483
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,813
you know,
traditionally I should probably have my 

484
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:27,184
own spot and,
and it should be completely focused in 

485
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,660
and established.
And,

486
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:32,461
you know,
like I said,

487
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:33,120
I just,

488
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,330
so you've obviously latched onto 
something.

489
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:36,841
I mean,
you've,

490
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,150
you've produced a pretty successful 
youtube channel,

491
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,150
so how,
how,

492
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
how common,
how did you manage that?

493
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,661
Well,
it was,

494
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,400
um,
I,

495
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,950
I mean from a young age,
I always knew that I wanted to entertain

496
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:48,784
people.
Like I just didn't know exactly what I 

497
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:53,650
thought it was going to be through music
because I always would play music.

498
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:54,370
I always,
uh,

499
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,930
you know,
started playing the guitar and the drums

500
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,250
and stuff.
And,

501
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,084
uh,
when I,

502
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,983
when I kind of reg recognize that that 
wasn't really what I wanted to pursue 

503
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:05,200
because of just the,
the independent,

504
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:07,420
like the independent thoughts and the 
stuff that I want to do,

505
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,820
the visions that I have,
it's very hard to work with people,

506
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:10,654
especially when there was other people 
have their own type of visions and 

507
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:13,504
ambitions.
So when there was something like 

508
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,390
Youtube,
oh,

509
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,360
when that became a thing,
um,

510
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,520
I started just,
just putting some stuff out there.

511
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:22,354
Like I actually,
I honestly thought I was going to be 

512
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,160
like a gaming channel when I first 
started the channel.

513
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,993
Um,
that was the first thing that I was 

514
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,310
going to try to do,
especially since,

515
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,810
uh,
gamers were doing so well.

516
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,640
It's like I would love to be a part of 
that community,

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,680
but when I saw,
um,

518
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,663
like I said,
free speech being threatened when I saw 

519
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:39,304
a,
the thing that propped up like say in 

520
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:41,350
2014,
ah,

521
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,910
Gamergate.
And,

522
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,790
um,
and,

523
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,370
and then there was all little where a 
lot of these,

524
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,390
you know,
radical leftist,

525
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,224
we're,
we're going after things like metal and 

526
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,430
saying that metal is sexist and stuff 
like that.

527
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,840
Um,
and we need to,

528
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
we need to do something about it.
And,

529
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:56,354
and that's when I started just putting 
out some content and people were 

530
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,720
starting to listen.
And,

531
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:00,554
um,
it's no secret that it's no secret that 

532
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,194
people,
a lot of people like to listen to me 

533
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,570
because they think like I'm a breath of 
fresh air.

534
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,700
It especially,
you know,

535
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,480
there's,
there's this,

536
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,070
there's a,
and there's a stigma,

537
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,791
um,
you know,

538
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,540
of,
of,

539
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,960
of black Americans where people are so 
shocked too that,

540
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,531
oh,
wow,

541
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,630
it's so nice to meet somebody that's not
x,

542
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:18,411
y,
z.

543
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,440
And you know,
it,

544
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,890
it sucks to say that it sucks to say 
that,

545
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,180
but it's just,
it's just the truth.

546
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,290
I mean,
you know,

547
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:24,930
the,
the,

548
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,763
the black men that I know in my area or 
say that I've met and I've lived in say 

549
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,990
south central Los Angeles just smack Dab
in the middle.

550
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,080
And it's just unfortunate.
It's an unfortunate community.

551
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:36,914
They're not really interested in like 
say they can really benefit from a pro 

552
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,090
the your program because they're,
they're just not interested in anything.

553
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,953
And a lot of people that I've met and 
I've worked a bunch of different jobs 

554
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,134
there,
they just,

555
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,500
they already,
they feel like they're,

556
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,680
they're doomed already.
Their,

557
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,430
their,
their destiny has already been set.

558
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,763
They are,

559
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,793
it's a terrible thing for people to say 
because the world is full of more 

560
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:01,170
possibility than people generally 
realize.

561
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:03,090
And um,
you know,

562
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,210
here's a couple of things that are,
that are interesting in that regard.

563
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:08,940
So you,
you may or may not deal with it.

564
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,010
I've done a lot of work on the 
psychology of religion.

565
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,450
And one of the things I did was look 
into the origin of the word sin.

566
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,883
And strangely enough,
so the word sin means essentially to 

567
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,950
violate the sacred moral code,
something like that.

568
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:25,320
And you can think about that is breaking
a rule,

569
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,513
but that's not exactly the right way to 
think about it because sometimes it's a 

570
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:32,640
sin not to break a rule.
You know,

571
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:36,450
if the rule is is,
is unjust or,

572
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,523
or tyrannical or outdated or blind,
then it's up to you to break the damn 

573
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:44,550
rule and to suffer the consequences.

574
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,383
And so to sit and means more to go 
against your own spirit and to violate 

575
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:54,930
your own spirit and to violate your own,
your own proper motive being,

576
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,640
you know,
to not to be true to yourself.

577
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:57,474
And it's actually derived from a Greek 
word and the word is 

578
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,473
[inaudible]. [inaudible] and [inaudible]
is an archery term and it means to miss 

579
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:08,040
the center of the target.
And so in my,

580
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:13,041
in my role as a clinical psychologist,
I'm always dealing with helping people.

581
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,050
Uh,
you might think what I'm doing is curing

582
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,160
mental illness,
but that's,

583
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,840
I don't think that's really what I'm 
doing.

584
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
What I'm doing is helping people get 
their lives together.

585
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,543
And lots of people come to me not 
because they have mental illness big 

586
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,780
because they have very,
very complicated lives.

587
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,660
They have,
their families are fractured or,

588
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,790
and they're under extreme societal 
pressure and they're,

589
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,683
you know,
they have economic trouble and maybe 

590
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:38,250
they're sick and like life is hard on 
them and they have real problems.

591
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,083
And what we try to do is to figure out 
what the target is and then figure out 

592
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:42,954
how they can hit it.
And I can tell you a couple of reasons 

593
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:45,654
why people fail.
And one reason is is that they don't 

594
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,630
ever define what constitutes success.
So they never even aim at the target.

595
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:59,190
And my experience has been,
if you specify a target intelligently,

596
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,024
like he can't,
you don't want to shoot your Arrow at a 

597
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,110
target that's 50 miles away that you 
can't see,

598
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,333
you're not going to hit it.
You have to put a target that's pretty 

599
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:10,140
close and then it's sort of within your 
skill level.

600
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,740
But most of the time if you set up a 
target property and you practice,

601
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:14,574
you can hit it.
And so the idea that people have that 

602
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,480
they're do from the outset.
That's,

603
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,280
that's true.
If you believe it.

604
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,700
And I know,
and I'm,

605
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,543
I'm not trying to say that that life is 
equally difficult for everyone and you 

606
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,120
should just pull up your socks and get 
at it.

607
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm not saying that because I know full 
well that that's not true,

608
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,450
but you can overcome a tremendous amount
of,

609
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,170
of,
uh,

610
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,180
opposition.
You can,

611
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,043
you can defeat a very,
very powerful set of adversaries if 

612
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:43,974
you're locked onto goal that you truly 
value and that and that you've thought 

613
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:47,934
through and articulate it.
And writing that down does really help 

614
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:54,120
as you observe before the psychological 
literature on that is very clear.

615
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,223
So I would say don't,
don't make the mistake of assuming that 

616
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:03,690
your life is doomed without putting that
theory thoroughly to the test.

617
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,150
And you know,
the other problem with that idea,

618
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,430
and this is something that goes along 
with nihilism,

619
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,560
is that you might say,
well,

620
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:11,394
it's,
it's pointless and I'm doomed and the 

621
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:15,030
world is against me.
It's like,

622
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,983
yeah,
the problem is that also gives you an 

623
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,444
excuse not to take any responsibility.
And maybe that's the underground reason 

624
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,900
why you're,
why you're saying that you're doomed and

625
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,600
that everything is stacked against you.
You know,

626
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,493
that,
and that's not to say that there aren't 

627
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:33,720
structural inequalities and all of that 
because obviously there are so,

628
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,780
yeah.
And,

629
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,613
um,
and that's something that I 100% agree 

630
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:38,280
with you.
I think that,

631
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:38,791
but I think,
yeah,

632
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:39,624
I think leaning more towards,
I think there's a lot of people that 

633
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,930
just try to opt out and they then,
you know,

634
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,430
they don't want to take any 
responsibility.

635
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,264
I think there's a bigger influence of 
that where there are clearly there are 

636
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:53,040
clear cut examples of,
of people just thriving,

637
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:53,900
you know,
um,

638
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,020
through the,
um,

639
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,120
the worst of circumstances.

640
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,680
I made this video called message to 
millennials at,

641
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,960
at New Year's around New Year's.
And that got to be very popular.

642
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:09,350
And I think it was,
I think I made the future,

643
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,190
I think I talked about the future 
authoring program in that video,

644
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:14,024
but one of the things I had thought 
about was I thought it would be comical 

645
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:20,750
and this was after I came across you,
I thought it would be comical if I could

646
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,260
run a discount code for the future 
authoring for black guys,

647
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,150
but I didn't know how I would do that.
But what's the demographics of your,

648
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
of your,
of your viewership,

649
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,610
do you know like who watches you?

650
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,583
There's a very small amount of,
my demographic normally is like say a 

651
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:39,670
Caucasian male of course.
And because of that there's a,

652
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:40,504
there are some,
some black dudes that just don't even 

653
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:43,820
want to,
that,

654
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:44,654
you know,
they want to call me a coon or an uncle 

655
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,134
tom or whatever.
And they're saying that I'm catering to 

656
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:51,850
the due to the white man and all this.
And

657
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,580
why do they say that though?
Because I mean like why is,

658
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:56,414
why is that,
why is that something that would be 

659
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:59,570
directed against you?
Because that seems like a,

660
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,410
like it's a curious kind of insult,
you know,

661
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,780
I mean I understand being insulted,
I get insulted,

662
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,050
but you,
your,

663
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,760
you have to wonder sometimes why it's 
that particular kind of insult that gets

664
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:13,550
directed against someone.
So why do you think that's being,

665
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,473
why are you,
why are you being put down in that 

666
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:16,874
particular way?

667
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I just feel like,
I feel like it's there.

668
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,870
I feel like there's a lot of people that
are just being told to think that way.

669
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,704
I don't,
I don't think genuinely because I never 

670
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,920
really had that issue.
Um,

671
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,793
I,
I really didn't have that issue growing 

672
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,920
up with,
um,

673
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,110
with like say when I would be in a,
in a,

674
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,740
in the black community.
Um,

675
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,520
there were a lot of them because there 
were some people that just like,

676
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,220
say for example,
that maybe grew up in a private school a

677
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:42,100
little bit and they had a diff,
a little bit of a different start.

678
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,430
Maybe they're an empty vessel and they 
were just able to just have like books,

679
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,550
like just literature and it didn't 
really grow up on TV and stuff.

680
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,743
And that's kind of how I got my start.
And then from there I just kind of 

681
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:55,060
entered the public spirit of,
of school and everything.

682
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,720
And so most people were pretty cool with
me.

683
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,660
But then as I started to gain a little 
bit of notoriety,

684
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:04,120
I started to notice that there's,
there's quite a few people that,

685
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:04,954
and I'm like,
where are you getting this thought 

686
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:07,780
process from where I'm,
I'm,

687
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:11,080
I'm like a trader or I am a coon if I 
don't,

688
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,710
if I'm not exactly like you,
if I'm not like say you know,

689
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,740
the stereotypical bt black guy that's 
just only exclusively into hip hop,

690
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,431
you know,
I like,

691
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,930
I love listening to hip hop,
but you know,

692
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,030
I also actually like,
um,

693
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,700
metal a lot more.
And because of that thing,

694
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:28,301
it's like,
oh,

695
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,380
you're,
you're a,

696
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,660
you're whitewashed or you're this.
And I'm like,

697
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:33,010
why?
Why?

698
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,240
Like why,
why are we,

699
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:34,590
he

700
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,423
seems particularly dopey to think of you
as a sellout because you've made 

701
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,324
yourself a presence on youtube.
It's not like anybody's handed that to 

702
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,250
you on a silver platter.
It was just something,

703
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,590
I mean,
that sort of thing is open to anyone.

704
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:49,470
And,
and we're in the wild west frontier days

705
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:52,860
of youtube and you built yourself a 
following,

706
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:55,500
pretty much of your own accord.
So I don't see,

707
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,543
I,
I mean it's to obviously some of it's 

708
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,840
got to be to do with resentment and 
jealousy.

709
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,370
You'd say that because that sort of 
thing that generally drives insults.

710
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,710
Right.
But I saw the same,

711
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,783
similar thing happening.
I thought it was very distressing at 

712
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,600
that free speech rally that we talked 
about.

713
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:15,990
There was a kid there who now works for 
rebel media,

714
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,910
Nikki opion guy and he's pretty dark
and pretty articulate,

715
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:21,321
you know,
and,

716
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,790
and now he's cut himself a good career 
with rebel media,

717
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:24,750
which is pretty funny.

718
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,763
But,
um,

719
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,840
when he was speaking at the open mic,
because it was an open,

720
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,290
open mic session,
the woman who founded black lives matter

721
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,930
in Toronto was standing about 12 feet 
away from him.

722
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,790
And she yelled coon Adam about a times 
and I thought,

723
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,931
well,
she's,

724
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:46,730
she's someone I have who I think is 
almost utterly contemptible and yeah.

725
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,860
And,
and because her,

726
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,160
her behavior generally speaking is 
beyond reprehensible.

727
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,173
But I thought that was,
I thought that was a remarkable thing 

728
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,890
for her to be doing.
Absolutely.

729
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,430
Jaw droppingly appalling things to think
to do.

730
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:04,700
But I was also curious about why that 
particular insult.

731
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,740
What does that mean to her?
I mean,

732
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,520
I,
I,

733
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,130
I wonder that myself.
Um,

734
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,233
I wonder that myself,
especially because like reading up from 

735
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:17,370
my understanding of what a coon actually
is and what a coon,

736
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,950
uh,
used to be was kind of like the,

737
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,630
was kind of like the whole,
uh,

738
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,493
the,
the shucking and jiving term where you 

739
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:26,220
had to like turn on,
you had to like put on like a,

740
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,150
a show to entertain,
you know,

741
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,390
the,
the masses or whatever.

742
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,490
You had to,
you had to like,

743
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,110
you know,
um,

744
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,900
for example,
be very stereotypical,

745
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,540
like say a lot of people that,
a lot of people in the black community,

746
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,150
the ones that are calling people a black
people like me,

747
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:42,984
a coon or kind of,
they're actually the ones that are at 

748
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:46,110
koons themselves.
Actually,

749
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,300
the Wa the way that I'm like,
yeah.

750
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:49,134
And it's like hate you mean?

751
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,101
Yeah.
And it's like,

752
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:50,911
dude,
it's so,

753
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:55,230
it's so embarrassing to see how like the
descent that I get on my channel,

754
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,640
I get a lot of,
um,

755
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,890
valid criticism from people.
Sometimes they'll,

756
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,580
they'll tear me a new ae because 
sometimes I'm just,

757
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,200
you know,
I deserve it.

758
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:07,320
Sometimes I deserve it.
But when it comes to like,

759
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,220
um,
black people,

760
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:10,620
usually the ones that are,
you can visibly see their thumbnails and

761
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:12,240
avatars.
It's just,

762
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,103
it's,
I actually feel very disappointed 

763
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:15,294
because it's usually just an ad hominem.
It's usually Kuhn and it's usually sell 

764
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:21,570
out.
I can just do the keyword search and,

765
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:22,404
and um,
search Koonin they see you as somebody 

766
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,074
joking around because I was,
I made a video like about a year ago or 

767
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:29,304
something just called like Hashtag 
[inaudible] Macoun just basically 

768
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,570
embracing it,
kind of showing me,

769
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,190
I don't really,
I don't really buckle.

770
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,200
I don't,
I really don't care.

771
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,320
Like the Ad Hominem attacks and just,
just petty insults.

772
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:41,720
It,
it does not affect me at,

773
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,830
at whatsoever.
So that was actually,

774
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,290
um,
I,

775
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,060
I,
I,

776
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,850
I was supposed to make a shirts and 
everything like that,

777
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,070
but I kind of got a little bit behind.
Um,

778
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,170
but yeah,
just kind of showing people that,

779
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:52,771
hey,
it's,

780
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:53,551
you know,
whatever,

781
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:56,040
just let that just slide off of you.
And,

782
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,330
um,
it's,

783
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,190
that's all,
that's all they have.

784
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:00,600
And I,
I just,

785
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,220
it does kind of break my heart a little 
bit.

786
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,810
I feel like,
say,

787
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,330
I would hope that I would be somewhat 
of,

788
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,880
um,
like of an example of,

789
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:10,140
hey,
you know,

790
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,550
it's not,
it's not hopeless.

791
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,960
Like you can,
you know,

792
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,490
it's,
it's stop,

793
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:18,070
stop talking about systemic racism and,
and saying that it,

794
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,123
you know,
chopping a doomsayer and try to better 

795
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:23,071
yourself,
you know,

796
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,090
try to,
if you're,

797
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,740
if you're living in a bad situation,
how,

798
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,170
how can you get yourself out of it?

799
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,560
I always use my mother as an example 
where she talks about just,

800
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,660
um,
all this stuff that she went through.

801
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:35,190
She went through a lot of stuff.
And,

802
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,160
and to be able to,
uh,

803
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,720
raise two kids and,
you know,

804
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,580
put us,
uh,

805
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,220
give us a good start in private school,
private elementary and,

806
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,123
and then on,
and then I went to public school 

807
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:45,731
afterwards.
But I had,

808
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:50,670
it just gave me a huge advantage to 
where my mind felt incredibly stimulated

809
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,560
to the point where I remember doing 
like,

810
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,510
uh,
uh,

811
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:57,330
fractions and taxes when I was in first 
grade.

812
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,583
Uh,
dealing with those type of things that 

813
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,560
were,
it was very typical that the time.

814
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,170
But now like very useful to the point 
where,

815
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,460
hey,
I do my own taxes,

816
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:08,740
I don't have any problems with that.
And like people are always like,

817
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:09,481
oh,
I don't know what to do.

818
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,550
I've got to pay somebody some money.
And I'm like,

819
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,150
Nah,
dude.

820
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,983
What?

821
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,830
I think also the insults,
like there's a,

822
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,020
there's a,
there's a kind of,

823
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,900
there's a kind of challenge that's 
associated with them too.

824
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:20,734
So if someone,
like if you're involved in a particular 

825
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:24,784
worldview and someone comes up who 
actually challenges that either by what 

826
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:28,684
they say or what they do,
the first thing you're going to do 

827
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,283
because you don't want to recalibrate 
your entire belief system is you're 

828
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:38,740
going to throw horrible things at them 
and see if any of them stick.

829
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,440
And so I guess partly what happens is 
that,

830
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,570
and I'm in,
I mean I've been insulted in that way as

831
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,580
well because people have called me a 
bigot and,

832
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,420
and it turns than up.
And uh,

833
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,573
I was protected against that to some 
degree I think because I'd already put 

834
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:53,464
500 hours of videos online.
And so if I was any of those 

835
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:58,144
reprehensible things,
people probably could have found that 

836
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:01,984
out pretty quickly by going through the 
material that I put online because I 

837
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,103
every,
almost every word I've uttered to 

838
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:12,640
students in the last five years has been
recorded and is publicly accessible.

839
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,473
So if there was anything in what I was 
saying or what I believe that was 

840
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,284
actually,
it actually deserved that kind of a 

841
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,770
derogatory classification,
then it would be found out very rapidly.

842
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,320
But it's also the case,
I think that people,

843
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,750
when they throw those sorts of things 
that you,

844
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,913
there's a part of them that's hoping 
that you can withstand it and tell them 

845
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,384
exactly why they're wrong.
Just on the off chance that you're the 

846
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:38,410
real thing.
And so you know,

847
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:39,244
you're,
you've got a certain amount of success 

848
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,490
that you generated yourself.
And so people are going to say,

849
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:43,324
well you sold out and then they're going
to sit back and watch and see what you 

850
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:47,320
say is like,
well,

851
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,470
I said he's sold out.
Maybe it's true,

852
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,633
but maybe he can defend himself too.
So it's sort of like people will throw 

853
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:58,120
the worst that they can at you and see 
if you can withstand it.

854
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,283
And that's part of the way they test to 
see if they actually should pay any 

855
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,220
attention to you.
And so,

856
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,810
so how come,
how come you're able to let the insults,

857
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:09,850
let's say,
why do you,

858
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,743
why do they,
I mean they must bother you to some 

859
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:12,874
degree,
but they don't bother you that much and 

860
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,950
you don't let them stop you.
And why is that?

861
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,170
Well,
it's the only thing like that,

862
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,770
that the only thing that bothers me is 
like say the insults when it,

863
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,200
when it comes to,
especially when it comes out,

864
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,043
when it's race related,
the ones that bother me are the ones 

865
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:32,980
that like say when it comes from,
when black people in general,

866
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,570
the ones that I would cause feel like 
say my content could help out.

867
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,441
Uh,
some,

868
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,110
some black Americans.
I've made some videos about saying,

869
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,113
you know,
stop basically stop just thinking that 

870
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,370
they're,
the world's against you.

871
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,790
Stop just thinking that uh,
United States is this a systemic,

872
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,510
a systemic racist system in 2017 or 
whatever.

873
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:55,090
And you can't,
there's just no point of trying,

874
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:56,260
like,
stop telling your children that,

875
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,280
you know,
like give them a,

876
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,443
give them a boost.
I would think that they would help me 

877
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,870
out.
So that's the only time when,

878
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,670
when they say stuff to me like that 
everybody else,

879
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,583
um,
I've been on the Internet for so long 

880
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,800
that people are just going to talk and 
say some of the worst things.

881
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,250
And most times they would never say it 
to your face.

882
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,620
They would never,
most people,

883
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:15,454
now it's starting to,
but now I'm starting to see a shift 

884
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,154
though,
especially from looking at the protest 

885
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,520
and,
and the speeches that you were trying to

886
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:23,500
give him and when people are trying to 
shut them down,

887
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,233
what I'm seeing is what normally used to
just be fantasy becoming reality and 

888
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,410
like in the,
in the entire spectrum where like say if

889
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,244
you've ever,
I don't know if you've ever actually 

890
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,990
been on tumbler.com I don't know if 
you've actually logged on there,

891
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:41,310
but see a lot of tumbler at all.
Yeah,

892
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,300
it is.
Um,

893
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,480
I would say that a lot of stuff that you
hear nowadays,

894
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,314
like when you hear about gendered 
pronouns diseaser and all the weird 

895
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:53,050
things that are coming up foot and the 
other Ken and,

896
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:53,884
um,
people just being just mean and just 

897
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:58,210
nasty to a lot of that stuff.

898
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,950
I would see that was tumbler.
Like I've never heard of any type of,

899
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,630
you know,
a hundred different type of,

900
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,610
uh,
pronouns until,

901
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,473
ah,
tumblr and I don't know what this was 

902
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:10,660
like the safe space for them,
I guess.

903
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,540
And now do you think Tumblr is like 
that?

904
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,760
Why do you think that's focused there?
I've,

905
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,560
I've wondered that myself.
I've,

906
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:18,270
um,
I,

907
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,940
I have a friend that I was,
I respect her greatly,

908
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,070
but she's one of those people that,
that,

909
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
you know,
uh,

910
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,653
changes her name and her and her 
pronouns and this and that and had a 

911
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,460
boyfriend that,
um,

912
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,190
you know,
he has a beard and stuff,

913
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:33,911
but he's like,
call me.

914
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:34,990
She,
and I'm like,

915
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,460
okay,
I'm sure.

916
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,713
Um,
but,

917
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,340
and I'm trying to figure out like what,
where I can't find the root and,

918
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:43,174
and seeing like his was there like a 
giant presence or maybe a public figure 

919
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,540
that maybe started talking about these 
ideas because I don't know,

920
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,403
the only thing,
that earliest thing that I could really 

921
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:51,994
find,
I remember like say back in 2011 I 

922
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:58,330
started seeing a trend happened in Texas
where it was being wolves.

923
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,930
Those were on that twilight movies.
This,

924
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,783
the twilight started to come out.
Maybe it was even younger because I 

925
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:03,880
think the toilets were,
yeah,

926
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:06,010
it came out a while ago on the movies.
But um,

927
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,143
I started seeing that a bunch of people 
are starting to dress like wolves or 

928
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:09,354
putting tails on and all these things.
And I was starting to see stuff like 

929
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:14,080
that and maybe it was just the pop 
culture,

930
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,420
things like that.
We're making it socially acceptable.

931
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:18,970
And then it started to be discussed on 
forums and everything.

932
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,310
And then maybe tomorrow.
I don't know how it became the,

933
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,301
the,
the,

934
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,134
the ground zero,
but it seems like that for me and now 

935
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,910
it's just being translated into 
academia.

936
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,920
Like your,
you're starting.

937
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,740
Okay.
So That's interesting because you know,

938
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,520
one of the things I've wondered about 
with all this identity

939
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,353
transformation,
and this includes not only the sort of 

940
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:42,410
gender let's call it play that you're 
talking about,

941
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,110
but also that other kin,
uh,

942
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,400
uh,
universe,

943
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,263
it looks a lot to me like the sort of 
fantasy play that's characteristic of 

944
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:50,984
kids when they were about ages say from 
about four to about nine or maybe four 

945
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,790
to 11,
you know,

946
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,260
that that would be the,
the,

947
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,080
the,
the maximal extent of it.

948
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:05,090
And I wonder to some degree if what's 
happening is that because,

949
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,943
because I don't think that modern kids 
get enough chance to engage in fantasy 

950
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,144
play.
Like,

951
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,720
like pretend play like they did 30 or 40
years ago,

952
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:18,350
that maybe that was,
that's been pushed aside by,

953
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,910
by mass media.
It's being pushed aside by computers and

954
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:26,180
video games.
It's been pushed aside by cell phones.

955
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:31,181
And it's also less common because 
children's play is so structured now,

956
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:32,444
partly because they don't have very many
siblings and play dates are set up in 

957
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,740
kids' lives are hyper structured.

958
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,300
And so kids have to go through that 
pretend play period.

959
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:45,470
And I'm wondering if maybe because we've
suppressed that in our society,

960
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,304
if it's blossoming out in universities 
when kids get away from their parents 

961
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,630
and can start to experiment with their 
own identity,

962
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,410
if they,
if they're doing that through uh,

963
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,281
in,
in,

964
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:56,841
uh,
in,

965
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,270
uh,
because it looks like pretend play.

966
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,870
I'm going to pretend to be a boy.
I'm going to pretend to be a girl.

967
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,380
I'm going to pretend to be an animal.
I'm going to pretend to be a war wolf.

968
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,000
It's fantasy play and there's a lot of 
objection when people say,

969
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,650
well,
I'm not going to play your game.

970
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,610
You can play your game,
but I'm not going you,

971
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,060
you don't have any right to compel me to
play your game.

972
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,133
But it may be that there's a 
developmental impulse that's being 

973
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,153
manifest there that didn't get its 
chance to express itself at the proper 

974
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:27,524
stage of development.
Something like that is it really is 

975
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:30,674
strange.

976
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,780
It is.
And I,

977
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,633
I,
I feel like there definitely is some 

978
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:36,580
type of correlation because when you,
when,

979
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,473
when I was,
when I was a kid and when know we're 

980
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,690
going out,
we were like,

981
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,520
oh,
I was just,

982
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,190
I'm old enough to where we didn't have 
any type of a technology other than like

983
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,830
say the Super Nintendo was,
was like,

984
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:47,760
oh,
this is amazing.

985
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,110
And I'm,
no,

986
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:49,944
I would take the bus.
I can only think kids can do this 

987
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:53,250
anymore.
Just take public transportation.

988
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,950
I'll be back by sundown.
I would go to another shitty,

989
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,993
sometimes I'll just go ride my bike and 
me and my friends would have like 

990
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:02,640
missions.
We would do crazy stuff hugely.

991
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,600
Like,
um,

992
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,480
I wish I recorded some of this stuff so 
I can remember it.

993
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,680
But my point is that yeah,
definitely kids don't have anything like

994
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,491
that.
And like you said,

995
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:12,810
the,
with the mass media,

996
00:44:12,811 --> 00:44:13,830
with a,
with the video games,

997
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:14,664
as much as I love video games,
there is so much structure that you 

998
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:19,224
can't really,
you can't really branch out and really 

999
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,460
create the,
you're very limited to what you can do.

1000
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,880
Even when like bdo games when you can 
like create a character and stuff.

1001
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,103
Sometimes that's as far as it can go,
but you're still kind of limited to 

1002
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,080
where you,
where you can,

1003
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,850
you,
you can't fantasize.

1004
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,833
It's why I say I still like,
I still love reading books because you 

1005
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,670
can just,
you create your own world in it.

1006
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:40,890
And then sometimes if somebody has read 
the same book,

1007
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,510
you can compare and contrast and be 
like,

1008
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,613
how do you see this character?
Even though if sometimes they describe 

1009
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,640
them,
you'll still have an imagery of how they

1010
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,260
look.
And I think that

1011
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,263
boy,
because I think what happened in part 

1012
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:52,440
was that,
you know,

1013
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:56,280
kids engage in pretend play when they're
too young to read,

1014
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,020
but then when they start reading 
fiction,

1015
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,213
they are still engaging in pretend play 
because they have to imagine the 

1016
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,084
characters.
Whereas in movies and in video games to 

1017
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:09,450
characters are basically put forth for 
them and that,

1018
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:12,610
and that there's utility in that because
there,

1019
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,970
there can be additional structure but 
the law,

1020
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,833
but the problem is,
is that additional structure also stops 

1021
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,310
you from having to use your imagination.
And it's,

1022
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,910
it's through your imagination that you 
experiment with all the different things

1023
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:27,330
that you could be.
And maybe that's just being pushed later

1024
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:28,164
into development now.
And that's why the young people are so 

1025
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:30,684
outraged when you,
when you violate their there pretend 

1026
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,560
identity,
you know,

1027
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:37,290
they look like kids playing to me except
that they're really,

1028
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,640
they're too old to be doing that.

1029
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,200
Yeah.
I mean,

1030
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,450
and that's where,
and that's why it's so,

1031
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,420
it's so absurd to me that say something 
like,

1032
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,580
uh,
uh,

1033
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,460
see 16 it could even be like,
pastor did that.

1034
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:53,280
There's even a need for it that there's,
because like you said,

1035
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,860
it does seem like make believe and 
pretend and it's like,

1036
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:59,310
how are you taking,
how can you take this seriously?

1037
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,420
How could you take this seriously and,
and,

1038
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,880
and,
and what's happening?

1039
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:05,640
It also seems like such a,
a major,

1040
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,630
uh,
regression,

1041
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,150
like something that you're trying to 
hammer down on,

1042
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,003
like say on free speech,
you can get in trouble by misusing 

1043
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:15,840
someone's pronouns.
And then now,

1044
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,130
um,
recently,

1045
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,233
uh,
m one oh three motion the motion has 

1046
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:21,654
been brought up and um,
what has been going on with in one word 

1047
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,460
in one or three?
Have you been keeping up with that?

1048
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,513
Oh yeah.
Well,

1049
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,473
well,
one of the things that's happening 

1050
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,250
that's really interesting is that,
um,

1051
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,223
as far as I'm concerned,
so I'm going to do a couple of lecture 

1052
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:37,990
series or a lecture series in the next 
year and I'm starting in May.

1053
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:38,824
And what I want to do is start at the 
beginning of the Bible and talk about 

1054
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:43,024
the psychological significance of all 
the stories right from the beginning to 

1055
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:47,830
the end.
But I also,

1056
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,370
and this is something I,
my Patriot patrion funding is helping me

1057
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:52,204
with this.
And then there's something else that I 

1058
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:53,884
want to do in parallel,
which is that I started talking to a 

1059
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:57,094
group of moderate Muslims about a week 
and a half ago while and some a couple 

1060
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:01,241
of months ago.
Very,

1061
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:05,560
very smart people and very committed and
they want to put forth,

1062
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,783
uh,
they want to start the process of 

1063
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:13,501
describing what a reformed and moderate 
Islam might be.

1064
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,183
And so,
and I think that's the right way to go 

1065
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:17,884
with regards to the tension that exists 
between the West and the Islamic world 

1066
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:25,090
or even within Canada,
between,

1067
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,540
there isn't a lot of tension in Canada.

1068
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,210
Yeah,
I'm about anything really.

1069
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,044
But to the degree that there is tension,
what needs to be done between new 

1070
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,334
immigrant communities and the 
communities that they're integrated to 

1071
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:43,231
obviously is for a dialogue of consensus
to be B to b started.

1072
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,300
And hopefully that I'm going to engage 
in that.

1073
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:49,840
And that's the proper way to fight 
Islamophobia.

1074
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,883
But the,
the current government insisted that 

1075
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,610
this motion,
which is,

1076
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:56,140
it's not a bill,
it's just a,

1077
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,243
it's emotion,
which is a expression of commitment on 

1078
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:02,250
the part of parliament to go and study,
uh,

1079
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,313
uh,
um,

1080
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,850
an issue or to make a moral stance on an
issue.

1081
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,460
And they described

1082
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,663
the concern with the emergent 
Islamophobia and the opposition parties 

1083
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:19,941
in Canada complained about the 
specifications of Islam in this,

1084
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,040
in the wording of this motion and said,
well,

1085
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:23,640
look,
we can,

1086
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,473
we will all support an Auntie prejudice 
and anti harassment and 

1087
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:31,260
antidiscrimination motion cross 
religions,

1088
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,153
no problem.
But if you use that word Islamophobia 

1089
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:37,230
specifically,
we're not going to support it.

1090
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,453
And so they offered to the,
to the current government the 

1091
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:43,920
possibility of unanimous consent for the
motion,

1092
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,070
but the originators of the bill wouldn't
withdraw the wording,

1093
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,790
which I thought was absolutely appalling
because Islamophobia is a really,

1094
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,360
it's not a good word,
stress ball.

1095
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,480
It takes a medical term phobia and uses 
it politically,

1096
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,720
which is really a treacherous and sneaky
thing to do.

1097
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,003
And second,
it specifies a specific religion when 

1098
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:08,070
there's no evidence that that religion 
is being specifically targeted.

1099
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,173
I mean it might,
there's no real evidence in Canada that 

1100
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,563
the adherence of that religion or 
suffering from any more discrimination 

1101
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,610
then the adherence of other minority 
religions or even the adherence of,

1102
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,880
of so called majority religions.
So it was a very bad idea.

1103
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,863
But,

1104
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,600
and so I,
I think just other approach is better.

1105
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,883
And so my I publicly opposed m one oh 
three a with a certain amount of the 

1106
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:37,530
fact because I'd be talking to the 
people who,

1107
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,160
who are running for the leadership of 
the official opposition in Canada,

1108
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:41,994
the Conservative Party.
And I've talked to a number of them 

1109
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:44,634
about [inaudible] three and about also 
we shoes of responsibility among young 

1110
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:48,024
men because the conservatives finally 
have something to sell at young people 

1111
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,390
and they never have it for the first 
time in the history of,

1112
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,020
of conservatism during my lifetime 
anyways.

1113
00:49:58,021 --> 00:49:58,854
The Conservatives have something to sell
to young people and that's 

1114
00:50:00,571 --> 00:50:01,404
responsibility.
And so we've also been talking a lot 

1115
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:05,730
about that.
But,

1116
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,960
um,
so,

1117
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:10,290
so there was some opposition to I'm one 
or three and I think the proper way to,

1118
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,213
to progress with that too,
to reduce the tension between the 

1119
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:18,290
Islamic world in general but also 
Islamic newcomers in Canada and,

1120
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,770
and longer term Canadians is to engage 
in a dialogue with moderate people.

1121
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,900
And I hope that that's going to get off 
the ground.

1122
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:25,734
We've,
we've got the ball rolling in some very 

1123
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,333
people already on board.
We've got the ball rolling for that and 

1124
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:34,460
I hope I'm going to play a role in that.
So that would be really exciting.

1125
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,640
It would be really fun to do that in 
parallel with this biblical series.

1126
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,870
So,
cause then I can,

1127
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,500
I can approach the fundamental stories 
of,

1128
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,363
of Judaism and Christianity at the same 
time as engaging in a public discussion 

1129
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:51,500
about the meaning of Islam and the 
implications of Islamic belief for,

1130
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,110
for,
for the broader political culture.

1131
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,890
So that's an exciting opportunity.
No doubt about it.

1132
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,380
Yeah,
that sounds great.

1133
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:02,410
And it sounds like a great way to go 
about it too.

1134
00:51:02,411 --> 00:51:04,060
If you can do those things 
simultaneously,

1135
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,150
especially he's still,
there can be any talk about like,

1136
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,510
oh,
he's just a criticizing Islam or,

1137
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,560
or,
or whatever.

1138
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:12,790
When you also,
you're just,

1139
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,421
you're,
you're,

1140
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:14,254
you're,
you're talking about just religion and 

1141
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,770
that kind of across the board,
you know,

1142
00:51:17,771 --> 00:51:19,990
and I'm trying to understand it.
Yeah.

1143
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,463
And I think a lot of people are too,
and I think that's kind of like what's 

1144
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:26,404
so frustrating about what's been 
happening and things like say in one or 

1145
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:33,871
three even like existing or say 
something for quite some time on,

1146
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,863
on youtube that just,
there are certain words that if you put 

1147
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:38,740
it in your title,
your tags,

1148
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:42,310
like your video would be demonetized.
They're saying it's advertiser,

1149
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:45,070
it is an advertiser friendly.
And you know,

1150
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,560
sometimes you wouldn't even be saying 
anything harsh.

1151
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,453
I like say sometimes they'll say,
I would just love to have an honest and 

1152
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:51,304
open dialect about Islam because I think
there's a lot of people that don't 

1153
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:54,154
understand it.
Now there was a lot of people that are 

1154
00:51:55,181 --> 00:51:55,931
just like,
oh,

1155
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:56,764
all Muslims are this.
And I've seen quite a few people that 

1156
00:51:59,021 --> 00:51:59,531
are like that.
I'm like,

1157
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:01,480
wow,
I think we need to talk about this.

1158
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,673
And,
and people don't want to talk about it 

1159
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:04,834
because people that were full time,
you're not gonna make any money off of 

1160
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:08,451
it.
And it sucks.

1161
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:09,284
Like,
I feel like it's such more of a 

1162
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,260
important issue that I would just,
I wouldn't like say I put out a video,

1163
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:16,000
um,
this just talking about what happened in

1164
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:18,560
London not too long ago,
just because I,

1165
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,020
and I knew it was going to do monetize 
my,

1166
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:20,920
like,
why not?

1167
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,140
I want to just at least put it out there
and just saying,

1168
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,010
can we,
can we,

1169
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:25,180
can we talk about this?
Can we,

1170
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:28,900
can we be honest and say that there's 
definitely some type of issues.

1171
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:30,640
And like on both sides,
there's,

1172
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,713
there's just,
um,

1173
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,553
you know,
there's a lack of communication and I 

1174
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:35,501
think,
yeah,

1175
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:37,300
what you're,
what you're gonna do is,

1176
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:40,570
is fantastic because it's,
it's desperately needed.

1177
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,893
Yeah,
yeah,

1178
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,823
yeah.
Well,

1179
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,113
you know,
I'm fortunate because last April when I 

1180
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,074
set up my patron account,
which was way before this political 

1181
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,860
political issue exploded,
I did it mostly out of curiosity because

1182
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:55,850
you know,
I was making,

1183
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,773
I would say,
fairly low quality videos from a 

1184
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:01,040
production perspective.
I was just using an ipad on a,

1185
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,120
on a tripod.

1186
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,113
Okay.

1187
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:14,440
I was just using an ipad on a tripod and
I thought,

1188
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,310
well,
maybe I could,

1189
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,240
you know,
I,

1190
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,130
by that time I'd had about a million 
views.

1191
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:18,970
And I thought,
wow,

1192
00:53:18,971 --> 00:53:19,990
that's,
that's a lot,

1193
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:20,824
man.
If I wrote a book that sold a million 

1194
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,010
copies,
I'd be dancing a jig out on the street.

1195
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:27,630
So I was starting to take youtube 
seriously because I thought,

1196
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,670
I thought about it for a while and I 
thought,

1197
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:30,841
well,
oh,

1198
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,490
I see what's happening.
This is,

1199
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,623
this is like a Gutenberg revolution.
It's the first time in human history 

1200
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:41,520
where the spoken word has as much reach 
as a book and as much permanency.

1201
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,590
And that's a whole new thing,
man.

1202
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,810
And,
and it's way faster than a book.

1203
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,220
Like you can,
as you know,

1204
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:48,090
you can.
Well,

1205
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:48,924
this video we're making right now,
we can have this published and in front 

1206
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,780
of an audience,
an immense audience,

1207
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:58,860
and attract a couple of hundred thousand
viewers within a few days.

1208
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,600
It's unparalleled.
And so I thought,

1209
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:01,434
oh,
I'll set up a patriot and account 

1210
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,680
because that was a new thing too.
And because I was,

1211
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:05,514
I've been really curious about how 
creative people can monetize what 

1212
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:08,514
they're doing and it's very difficult.
And so I was looking into that and I 

1213
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,550
found Patriot and I thought,
well I'll set up a patriot account,

1214
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,403
see what happened.
But I was fortunate because I decided 

1215
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:21,360
not to use advertiser generated revenue 
on Youtube.

1216
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,020
I decided to use patron and I didn't 
know it at the time,

1217
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:25,854
but that also made me more or less 
immune to threats of such things as 

1218
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,990
demonetization,
which is,

1219
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,200
which is a form of,
it's not exactly a form of censorship,

1220
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:35,760
it's more,
it's more like,

1221
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,073
it's more like an attempt to turn the,
the tremendous diversity of music on 

1222
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:46,740
youtube into elevator music.
Right.

1223
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,460
It can be contentious because then you 
can't sell advertising on it.

1224
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,230
Well,
if it's not contentious.

1225
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:54,000
And interesting.
No one's going to watch it.

1226
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:57,000
So it's a,
it's a suicide move in some sense on the

1227
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:00,300
part of the advertisers because if they 
sanitize youtube,

1228
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,700
then all that's going to happen is 
another,

1229
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,620
another free speech video site is going 
to pop up and people are all gonna flock

1230
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:11,220
there in no time flat.
Like it's longterm suicidal move.

1231
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,503
But um,
but there are ways to protect yourself 

1232
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:16,200
against it.
Um,

1233
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,113
and,
and Patriot on seems to be an 

1234
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,920
interesting way of doing that.
How many,

1235
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:22,410
how many youtube videos have you had?
Demonetized

1236
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,950
um,
I've had,

1237
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,610
I've,
I've,

1238
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,910
luckily I haven't had too many,
I probably had a total of like six.

1239
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,410
And um,
the,

1240
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:30,780
the,
the ones that,

1241
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:31,783
the main ones that have been demonetized
where the were pretty old and I wasn't 

1242
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:37,120
really going to generate any money for 
them anyways.

1243
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,670
So it was,
and however,

1244
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,360
this month,
um,

1245
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,090
I've had one of them that was one of my 
better videos,

1246
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:48,190
the,
or at least it did better.

1247
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,500
And it was the one about,
um,

1248
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,373
the,
the attack in London and that was 

1249
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,400
immediately to monetize.
And I was just like,

1250
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:55,090
well,
okay,

1251
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,560
fine.
And then another one,

1252
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,740
because because of,
um,

1253
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,120
the whole ad hysteria with a bunch of 
the companies pulling out,

1254
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,540
they started to crack down a little bit 
harder.

1255
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:07,130
And they am,
I responded to,

1256
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:07,983
there's this company called Mike and 
they just still put out a bunch of 

1257
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:10,510
nonsense.

1258
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,343
Like a lot of people are starting to 
pull back a little bit on their social 

1259
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:16,300
justice warrior,
ultra progressive nonsense,

1260
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,433
but they're still pushing on.
And they had a video called things by 

1261
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:22,330
people killed in 2016 and we're just 
like a bunch of trends,

1262
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:23,164
right?
A dancing moves and all this stuff 

1263
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,260
saying that if why people do it,
it's,

1264
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,860
you know,
it's cringy a,

1265
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:29,470
and I'm,
and it's still,

1266
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,191
you know,
just being,

1267
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:33,070
it's only true for nerdy white people.
It's right.

1268
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:33,904
I mean,
that's really what it comes down to 

1269
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,720
like,
but like,

1270
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,230
I mean,
and it comes out even like say,

1271
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:39,064
I mean just nerdy people in general when
you see people dance or do something 

1272
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:42,724
that just have no rhythm,
it's just so cringey but you just can't 

1273
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,600
look,
you get the secondhand embarrassment.

1274
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,040
Right.
And um,

1275
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,900
but yeah,
they just put out some ridiculous stuff.

1276
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,733
So I reacted to that and that video did 
very well and that got demonetized 

1277
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:55,721
recently,
so I'm like,

1278
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:56,554
oh great.
So I'm not going to get anything from 

1279
00:56:57,941 --> 00:56:59,760
that anymore.
One last thing I want to ask you because

1280
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,390
people really wanted to know,
uh,

1281
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:04,780
what is your opinion on pineapple pizza 
as a topping?

1282
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,720
Um,
well a pineapple is upon you hate,

1283
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:12,040
you hate pizza.
I used to work at a pizza restaurant and

1284
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,203
I learned was that you actually have a 
lifetime maximum of pizza ingestion and 

1285
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,770
once you hit that,
you can't actually eat any more pizza.

1286
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,130
And so I hit that when I was about 16 
cause I worked in a pizza restaurant for

1287
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:24,964
about four years.
And so I ate my 10000th pizza and that 

1288
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:28,930
was like,
oh,

1289
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,763
that's it,
man.

1290
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:30,703
There was something about the spice.
I think it might be a Reagan know that 

1291
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,024
that specific spice that I don't like,
and so even covering it up with 

1292
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,350
pineapple,
that would improve it,

1293
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,070
but it still makes it really difficult 
for me to eat pizza.

1294
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,390
All right.
Fair enough.

1295
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:44,420
Fair enough.
All right.

1296
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,520
All right.
Sounds good.

1297
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,350
All right.
I'm Dr. Peterson.

1298
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,290
Thank you so much for taking the time 
out of your,

1299
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,710
I'm sure your insanely busy schedule to 
talk to me,

1300
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:54,544
man.
It's been an absolute honor and it was 

1301
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,400
real fun and I like your channel and I 
wish you the best of luck,

1302
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,660
truly,
and I hope you,

1303
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,830
I hope you get yourself oriented and,
and knock 'em dead.

1304
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,260
Good.
Most definitely,

1305
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:09,011
man.
Thanks again.

1306
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:10,520
I appreciate it all.
All right.

1307
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,653
All right.
Bye.

1308
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,603
Bye.
