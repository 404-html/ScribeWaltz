1
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,583
Neat.
You talking about the European state of 

2
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,000
mind at the end of the 19th century.
So Nisha says,

3
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,010
well we're in this terrible situation,
right?

4
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,350
God is dead.
We've killed them.

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,303
What does that mean?
While we've taken our evolved 

6
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,560
metaphysics,
which structures are moral viewpoint and

7
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,870
undermined by rational criticism,
a peculiar move,

8
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,740
Toma softly cause it was never 
established on rational grounds.

9
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:56,574
Anyways,
we've undermined it rationally and 

10
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,510
replaced it with well nothing,
nothing.

11
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,483
What's the consequences that,
well he outlines that here of what is 

12
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,764
great.
One must either be silent or speak with 

13
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:14,301
greatness and you can think about this 
as a prophecy on the events of World War

14
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,204
One and World War II and the Gulag 
archipelago and the 60 million people 

15
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,124
dead in the Soviet Union and the whole 
unfolding of 20th century history and 

16
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,730
the great ideological battles that 
characterize that unfolding.

17
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
So this is something nature sees coming 
and knows was why he says of what is 

18
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:33,420
great.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,090
One must either be silent or speak with 
greatness,

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,013
with greatness.
So that means cynically I'm with 

21
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,234
innocence.
What I related to the history of the 

22
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:44,850
next two centuries.
I describe what is coming,

23
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,170
what can no longer come differently?
The advent of nihilism,

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,580
right?
The belief and nothing.

25
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,223
Our whole European culture is moving for
some time now with a tortured tension 

26
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,364
that's growing from decade to decade,
I was towards a catastrophe restlessly 

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,893
violently headlong like a river that 
wants to reach the end that no longer 

28
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,350
reflects.
It's afraid to reflect.

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,910
He that speaks here has conversely done 
nothing so far,

30
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
but to reflect as a philosopher and 
solitary by instinct who is found his 

31
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,394
advantage and standing aside outside.
Why is the advent of nihilism become 

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,224
necessary?
Because the values we've had hitherto 

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,240
thus draw their final consequence 
because nihilism represents the ultimate

34
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:33,030
logical conclusion of our great values 
and ideals.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,373
Because we must experience nihilism 
before we can find out what value these 

36
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,910
values really had.
We require at some sometime new values.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,590
Nihilism stands at the door when it 
comes this uncanny,

38
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,860
first of all,
guests nihilism,

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
right?
Your beliefs or undermined once.

40
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,260
What's the consequence of that?
Well,

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,103
one consequences.
The belief has undermined the other 

42
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,270
consequences.
More metaphysical,

43
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:06,160
which is fooled once you no longer have 
the belief.

44
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,010
But maybe it's even worse than that 
because human beings can generalize,

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
fooled once you never have any,
you no longer have any belief in 

46
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,220
beliefs,
which mean you say something like this,

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,220
I don't care what you think.
It doesn't matter what you think.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,173
The world is such a terrible place that 
no interpretation whatsoever can 

49
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,060
possibly suffice.
That's nihilism.

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,930
No meaning system whatsoever can 
possibly suffice.

51
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,840
Well,
what's the flaw or the flyers?

52
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,501
Well,
of course,

53
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,334
no system of coherent belief can suffice
because most of the world's 

54
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:40,480
transcendent,
you can't encapsulate everything that is

55
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,100
in your sphere of belief.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,113
And what you might say then is that if 
you ever believe that what you believe 

57
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,010
is what should support you,
the facts,

58
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,180
you know,
say,

59
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,100
or the interpretation you place in the 
world,

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,780
then your faith is badly misplaced.
You don't believe in what you believe.

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,790
You believe in something that's deeper 
than that.

62
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,060
And so then you see what's wrong with 
Tolstoy,

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,550
right?
And tolstoy story.

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,340
And tolstoy says,
uh,

65
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,220
accounting for his collapse in the 
stability of Christian belief.

66
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,290
He said,
this all happened,

67
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,100
this collapse of my belief when I was 
not yet 50 years old,

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,500
I should have been considered a 
completely happy man.

69
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,603
I had a good loving and beloved wife 
find children and the largest state 

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,010
growing and expanding without any effort
on my part.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
I was respected by friends and 
acquaintances,

72
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,620
praised by strangers and could claim a 
certain renown.

73
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,440
I was not physically nor mentally 
unhealthy.

74
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,530
On the contrary,
I enjoyed a physical and mental vigor.

75
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,870
I had rarely encountered among others my
age.

76
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,973
I could keep up with a peasant's working
in the fields and work eight and 10 

77
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,274
hours at a stretch without suffering any
after effects from the stream and in 

78
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,940
such a state of affairs.
I came to a point where I could not live

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,523
and even though I fear death,
I had to employ ruses against myself to 

80
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,184
keep from committing suicide.
It was as though I had lived a little 

81
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,683
wondered a little until I came to a 
precipice and I clearly saw that there 

82
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,010
was nothing ahead except room and there 
was no stopping or turning back.

83
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,143
No closing my eyes so that I would not 
see that there was nothing ahead except 

84
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,234
the deception of life and of happiness 
and of the reality of suffering and 

85
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,130
death of complete annihilation.

86
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,863
I grew sick of life.
Some irresistible force was leading me 

87
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,044
to somehow get rid of it.
This thought was such a temptation that 

88
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,890
I had to use counting against myself in 
order to not to go through with it.

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,083
And there I was,
a fortunate man carrying a rope from my 

90
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,314
room where I was alone every night as I 
addressed so that I would not hang 

91
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,374
myself from the beam between the closets
and I quit going hunting with a gun so 

92
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,380
that I would not be too easily tempted 
to rid myself of life.

93
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,550
I myself did not know what I wanted.
It was afraid of life.

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,340
I struggled to get rid of it,
yet I hope for something from it.

95
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,983
My position was terrible.
I knew that I could find nothing in the 

96
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,194
way of rational knowledge except denial 
of life and in faith I could find 

97
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,590
nothing except the denial of reason.
And for me this was even more impossible

98
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:08,120
than a denial of life.
I myself according to rational knowledge

99
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,790
at followed that life is evil and people
know it.

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,840
I describe my spiritual condition of 
myself in this way.

101
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,180
Okay.

102
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,013
My life has some kind of stupid and evil
practical joke that someone is playing 

103
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:20,464
on me in spite of the fact that I did 
not acknowledge the existence of any 

104
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:24,454
someone who might've created me.
The notion that someone brought me into 

105
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,264
the world as a stupid and evil joke seem
to be the most natural way to describe 

106
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,374
my condition.

107
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,040
Yeah.

108
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,680
I could not be deceived.
All is vanity.

109
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,670
Happy is he was never been born.
Death is better than life.

110
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,020
We must rid ourselves of life.
Having realized all the stupidity of the

111
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,854
joke that is being played on us and 
seeing that the blessings of the dead 

112
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,350
are greater than those are the living 
and that it's better not to exist.

113
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,393
The strong act and put an end to this 
stupid joke and they use any means of 

114
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,290
doing it.
A rope around the neck,

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,530
water,
a knife in the heart or a train.

116
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,050
Now,
the interesting thing about this,

117
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:05,600
I think is first of all,
a Russian wrote it and second of all,

118
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,434
it was written in the late 19 hundreds 
and even more particularly is that you 

119
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,530
note that when the strong act using a 
rope around the neck,

120
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,810
water,
a knife in the heart and a train,

121
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,003
well tolstoy is talking about suicide,
but there's no necessary reason to 

122
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,130
presume that this should only be 
violence and gender against the self,

123
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,530
right?
If life is a stupid and evil joke,

124
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,364
then what's stopping you from 
benevolently putting an end to the 

125
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,070
suffering of others,
right?

126
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,090
Benevolently in theory at least.

127
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,731
Well,
you know,

128
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:41,990
that's one perspective,
right?

129
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:42,824
But then there's always the perspective 
of the lady who went to see the 

130
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,410
psychiatrist in ts Elliot's poem,
which is,

131
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,960
well,
if when your eyes are open,

132
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:54,560
life appears as nothing but suffering 
and pain to you.

133
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,573
It could be that that is how life is.
But it can also be that there's 

134
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,980
something wrong with the way that you're
looking at the world.

135
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,950
And in some ways that's a much more 
humble perspective,

136
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,080
right?
Because the alternative the as well,

137
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,973
I know what's going on and I just look 
out there and there's the world and I'm 

138
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,024
pretty much got it.
Like I know what it means and what it 

139
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,524
means is pointless suffering and pain 
and that's my model and I don't see any 

140
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,590
reason to question it,
but then the alternative is,

141
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,850
well,
wait a second.

142
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,983
There's always the possibility that I 
don't know absolutely everything and 

143
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,094
this final and horrible judgment that 
I'm placing on the conditions of 

144
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,814
existence could conceivably be misplaced
given the sort of presumptuousness of 

145
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:35,480
the claim.
Right.

146
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm in a position to render final 
judgment on the moral value of existence

147
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,740
as such.
It seems to me

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,313
reasonable to presume that that's not 
the kind of statement that you should 

149
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:53,270
easily make.
Can I remember when George Bush launched

150
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,550
his most recent war?
The initial terminology,

151
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,260
I think this was for the Afghanistan 
battle was operation infinite justice,

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
but he retracted that phrase after a 
number of religious leaders objected to.

153
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,304
It's kind of presumptuousness,
which I thought was quite reasonable 

154
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,214
because infinite justice is something 
that most people should probably not 

155
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,960
hope for,
right?

156
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,063
Because you never know precisely what 
infinite justice means because it might 

157
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:23,100
just mean that every bloodied mistake 
you've ever made,

158
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,083
you're going to pay for.
And I suppose that would be just as 

159
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,860
applicable to George W.
Bush as it would to anybody else.

160
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,190
And then Milton again describes the 
development of this adversarial spirit.

161
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,690
He says,
first pride,

162
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,330
pride,
and worse ambition threw me down.

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
That's Satan's lament when he's in hell.
And Milton's description of hell is 

164
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,430
extremely interesting.

165
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,830
He said,
the reason that hell is characterized by

166
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,130
its structure is not so much because of 
its nature.

167
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,964
Precisely.
It's because of its distance from the 

168
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,544
good.
So the farther you are away say from 

169
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:59,520
what constitutes the good,
the more suffering is the more suffering

170
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,520
is endemic to that state.
So it's,

171
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,590
it's the distance away from something 
that constitutes the suffering.

172
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,424
And then Melton says,
it's very interesting to do an analysis 

173
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,560
of Satan's character and the notion of 
hell per say,

174
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,394
because how in the world can you 
reconcile the idea of a good God with 

175
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:17,610
the notion of this continual suffering?
And so Milton says,

176
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,444
well,
Satan can step out of hell in one 

177
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,573
moment.
All he has to do is meant that he was 

178
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,374
wrong.
And that's the one thing that he will 

179
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,700
not do under any circumstances 
whatsoever.

180
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,650
So then we put one more twist on the 
story and we say something like this.

181
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,483
Okay,
we already know that part of the reason 

182
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,094
that people have belief systems is so 
that they can structure their 

183
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,930
interactions with the world.
It's a toolbox.

184
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,080
Say we're playing a game,
we share the rules,

185
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,880
that's fine.
We can cooperate with one another.

186
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:45,714
It could be other than it is,
but it's the way it is and it works for 

187
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,344
us.
That's fine.

188
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,920
There's nothing absolute about it except
that a structure like that's necessary.

189
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,110
Now whenever there's a threat to that 
shared view of the world,

190
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,060
well then we're afraid and for good 
reason.

191
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:00,894
And,
and it's not surprising under those 

192
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,430
circumstances that we fight to defend 
what we've made ours.

193
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,820
But then you say,
let's say you adopt this perspective,

194
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,654
right?
And it's this vengeful desire to wreak 

195
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:17,100
havoc that extends beyond other 
individuals and beyond society.

196
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,010
Even to the structure of experience as 
such.

197
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,844
And then you think,
well,

198
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,710
what's the best mask for that?

199
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,990
And how do these two processes sort of 
interact?

200
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:25,824
And you think,
well,

201
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,983
the most efficient way to do terrible 
things is to mask them with the highest 

202
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,914
order morality.
And that's precisely what the 

203
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,940
totalitarian does.
So that way he gets to have his cake and

204
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:39,774
eat it too.
He's perfectly well protected from 

205
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,653
apprehension of the world because his 
belief system is complaint plus these 

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,193
underground motivations,
which is this constant desire for 

207
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:49,854
revenge,
can find their expression within the 

208
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,420
totalitarian structure and remain 
invisible even to himself.

209
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,660
So he can say to himself,
well,

210
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:03,661
the reason I threw all those farmers out
of their house in 1920 I'm stalled.

211
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,564
Their soup and their food and their 
grandmothers blankets and everything 

212
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,410
they'd work to own was because I was 
building the socialist paradise.

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,333
Right.
And it was a good thing for me to go 

214
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:14,704
into that house and not a bad thing.
And as long as he believes that or acts 

215
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:18,664
as if he believes that,
then he can look in the mirror without 

216
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,440
screaming.
And there's no recognition whatsoever of

217
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,660
precisely the sort of game that he's 
involved in.

218
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,850
So he has it both ways,
right?

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,833
He can do everything terrible that he 
always dreams of doing and consider 

220
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,224
himself not only good but good,
even at a higher level then the people 

221
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,790
that he was actually afflicting.
And of course,

222
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,240
that's just standard description of what
happened in the Soviet Union.

223
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,863
He just says,
I love this definition of morality is 

224
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,790
the most cynical thing niche ever said.
I think

225
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,153
the idiosyncrasy of decadence with the 
ulterior motive of revenging oneself 

226
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:06,450
against life successfully,
I attach value to this definition said,

227
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,840
well,
why are you an idiot log?

228
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,540
Well,
it's a good way to simplify the world,

229
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,460
right?
It's a procrustean bed.

230
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,410
You just chop off everything that 
doesn't fit,

231
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,420
then you don't have to think,
right?

232
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,090
So that's good because thinking is 
difficult and it's trouble.

233
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:19,924
Someone,
it takes courage and so forth to 

234
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,860
transform chaos into order is no trivial
matter.

235
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,843
And if it's all ordered for you,
well then there's really nothing left 

236
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,230
for you to do.
But then need,

237
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,950
she goes even below that,
he says,

238
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:30,784
yeah,
well there's more to the story than 

239
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:31,751
that,
isn't there?

240
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,584
It's like once he got this little 
procrustean bed all arranged for your 

241
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,310
enemies,
then you can,

242
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,710
you can allow your most base vengeful 
instincts,

243
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,590
full flow by just continually chopping 
people.

244
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,424
So they fit
and you do it all the while by well 

245
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,520
saying,
wow,

246
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,830
it's obviously the best thing that could
possibly be done.

247
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,953
Okay.

248
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,430
And so then you look
at Stellan say,

249
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,690
because not everybody who's adopted a 
vantage full tack on existence,

250
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:11,830
it's sort of like the archetype of 
vengefulness or adversarial spirit.

251
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,260
But he had to get now and then the 
people like stolen,

252
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,980
who are good counter example say to the 
people like Gandhi and so stones,

253
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,860
very instructive.
And so we could start by looking at what

254
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,861
he did in the Ukraine.
So at the end of 1929 the Kremlin decree

255
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:29,110
that millions of peasants from 
individually owned farms would be forced

256
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:33,640
into agricultural collectives or cold 
causes seen in the eyes of the politburo

257
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,563
as pliant providers of Soviet 
agricultural needs in defiance of the 

258
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,560
facts.
So they did the Ologists,

259
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,080
hammered out inappropriate Marxist 
terminology to explain what was going on

260
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,080
throughout grain producing areas.
It was sad.

261
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,930
Okay.

262
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,763
Resistance to this scientific scheme was
being by so called rich peasants are 

263
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,240
cool acts with his customer of 
brutality.

264
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,074
Therefore stellan decreed the 
liquidation of the cooler acts as a 

265
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,900
class we'll stand in like this idea of 
like group guilt.

266
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,793
That was a major theme for Stalin that 
man I really didn't have to ever pay 

267
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:10,010
attention to you as an individual.
I could just decide if you were a doctor

268
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,933
engineer or a Kulak or a German or 
whatever ethnic racial or educational 

269
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,084
division happened to characterize my 
particular target at the time and it 

270
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,280
didn't matter if you were guilty as an 
individual.

271
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,900
That whole notion never even obtained.
It was class guilt.

272
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:27,260
It mattered and if you were in one of 
those classes as well,

273
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,143
we are better without you and of course 
the nature of the class just changed 

274
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,574
constantly,
but it was perfectly logical thing to 

275
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,600
think if you believed in like historical
determinism.

276
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,793
If your parents were rich version law,
what was the probability that you are 

277
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,650
going to be a useful part of the 
workers' collective bs?

278
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,484
You're just to get rid of you ahead of 
time so you didn't cause too much 

279
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:46,334
trouble.
So then you think about these kulaks 

280
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,364
rich peasants.
Well who are these people like when we 

281
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,351
get down to the individual level.
So you go on village village was full of

282
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,154
surfs like not 40 years before.
So these are people just struggling out 

283
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,940
of the feudal society,
right?

284
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,013
And you got some people in there who've 
managed to be successful enough as 

285
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,464
farmers,
which is no easy thing to like have a 

286
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,460
house and maybe hire one person and you 
know,

287
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,294
maybe have a little extra food in a 
larder and a few kind of material 

288
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,660
possessions.
So these are successful people.

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,910
And so you could say,
well they're the ones that actually knew

290
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,620
how to farm to one theory.

291
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,950
Or You could say the reason they had all
this stuff was cause they stoled it from

292
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,090
all the other people,
right?

293
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,141
And then you think,
okay,

294
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,380
so I marched into town.
I'm a Soviet revolutionary and I say,

295
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,650
hey guys,
you know those rich people,

296
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,420
they stoled everything they have from 
you.

297
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,740
And then you think,
okay,

298
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,780
which of you guys is going to listen to 
that?

299
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,123
Well,
it's not going to be the sort of 

300
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,910
struggling people just underneath them 
who are really trying to get ahead,

301
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:44,744
right?
Because that's where they're hoping to 

302
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,460
get.
It's going to be.

303
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:49,490
They're resentful and revengeful few who
think,

304
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,503
well,
the world is fundamentally unfair and 

305
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,484
it's obvious that those sons of bitches 
got what they want by stealing it from 

306
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:55,754
me.
And here it turns out that if I just go 

307
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,170
down the street and steal it back,
well not only,

308
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,573
not only am I allowed to do that,
but according to this new and emergent 

309
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:05,660
ideology,
man,

310
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,360
that's the best thing I could possibly 
do.

311
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,403
So then multiply that story by several 
million participants and you have like 

312
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,410
the first five years of the Soviet 
Empire.

313
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,244
And so what do we have there?
The result was a catastrophic onslaught 

314
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,084
on millions of peasant households at 
first party activists and local 

315
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,970
officials read bullies,
right?

316
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,253
Brutalized hesitance,
forcing them to surrender their 

317
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,250
homesteads and their possessions,
deportations,

318
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,470
arrests,
and killing soon followed as terror,

319
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:34,304
generalized the violence mounted to full
scale rebellion in various places with 

320
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,600
regular troops engaged for months.
For example,

321
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,640
suppressing peasant uprisings resistance
took various forms,

322
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:50,670
usually reflecting the hopeless 
desperate anguish of a population in the

323
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,860
Ukraine.
There were even women's rebellions,

324
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,813
spontaneous uprisings of peasant women 
who attack the local Coco's is Tibet 

325
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,283
demand.
The return of confiscated farm products 

326
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,990
with a colossal impact on the Soviet 
economy.

327
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,290
Peasants slaughtered their animals by 
the millions rather than see them seized

328
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,260
for two years.

329
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,093
The fighting raged as the dreadful 
process of deep cooler conization 

330
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,774
continued Stella in order to further 
assault on the recalcitrant peasantry 

331
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,020
what conquest calls the terror famine of
1932 Moscow rights conquest.

332
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,780
It's from a book called the harvest of 
sorrow.

333
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,933
Knowingly decreed grain poker 
procurements from Ukraine and elsewhere 

334
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,180
exceeding by far with the local 
population could produce right,

335
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,014
which meant that everyone who lived 
there was forced in ordered to deliver 

336
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,674
more grain than they had ever grown.
Communists Brigades roam the 

337
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:45,144
countryside,
forcing agriculturalist to discourage 

338
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:50,280
the little they had been able to produce
under conditions of severe dislocation.

339
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,860
Grain sat unused in state reserves while
the local population starved.

340
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,180
This is from wisdom park riffle.
Biblical writings

341
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,860
before they reasoned unsoundly saying to
themselves short and Sora for all is our

342
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:12,094
life and there is no remedy when a man 
comes to his end and no one has been 

343
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,664
known to return from Haiti's because we 
were born by mere chance and hereafter 

344
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,284
we shall be as though we had never been 
because the breath in our nostrils is 

345
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:26,620
smoke and reason a spark kindled by the 
beating of our hearts.

346
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,723
When it is extinguished,
the body will turn to ashes and the 

347
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:30,364
spirit will dissolve like empty air.
Our Name will be forgotten in time and 

348
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,404
no one will remember our works.
Our life will pass away like the traces 

349
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,944
of a cloud and be scattered like mist 
that is chased by the rays of the sun 

350
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,933
and overcome by its heat for our 
allotted time is the passing of the 

351
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:46,780
shadow.

352
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,680
And there no return from our death 
because it is sealed up and no one turns

353
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:55,210
back.
So a piece of writing thousands of years

354
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,043
old.
And so Nisha says at the end of the 19 

355
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:57,784
hundreds well,
rationality undermines our faith and 

356
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:00,034
religion,
but you have a piece of writing from 

357
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:03,760
more than 2000 years ago that says,
look,

358
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,200
what is it about being alive?
It's short and there's nothing to it,

359
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,063
right?
Our thoughts are biologically produced 

360
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,880
and when we die,
there's nothing left.

361
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,920
Well,
that's a very modern thought.

362
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,020
Yep.
It was expressed thousands of years ago.

363
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:20,270
So you know,
I think merely from observing that,

364
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,104
that the crisis of faith that 
characterizes modern society is a 

365
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:28,210
reflection of the permanent crisis of 
faith that characterizes human beings.

366
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,883
What's happening with the totalitarian,
while the totalitarian is afraid of the 

367
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:35,830
unknown for good,
for good reason.

368
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,813
I mean,
and he's very interested in sustaining 

369
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,260
his own belief structure.

370
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,843
And the combination of those two things,
it can start off trivially is that the 

371
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,344
more convinced that you have to maintain
the stability of your current belief 

372
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,020
structure,
the more afraid you are of going to have

373
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,413
anything that's unknown and the more 
afraid you are of anything that's 

374
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,924
unknown,
the less likely you are to go out and 

375
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:00,994
explore it.
And then the less likely you already go 

376
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,274
out and explore it,
the weaker you get cause you start 

377
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:08,560
gathering information and then the week 
or you get the more necessary it is that

378
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,350
you have to have this frame of reference
in,

379
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:14,920
it has to remain intact and this sort of
thing starts to cycle and cycle.

380
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,754
So you undermine your own sense of your 
own autonomy and ability and you make 

381
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:19,864
yourself more and more a rigid tool of 
the propagandistic system and you're 

382
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:28,150
more and more adopt the stance of enmity
towards anything you don't understand.

383
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,710
And that's a spiral that goes rapidly 
downhill right rapidly into a state.

384
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,890
It's characterized by complete internal 
chaos.

385
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,763
And I think that's a good definition of 
what is meant in metaphysical language 

386
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,420
by hell.
Hell is a bottomless pit.

387
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,980
Why?
Well,

388
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:47,920
I don't care how bad things are for you 
or around you.

389
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,530
There's always some bloody thing you 
could do to make it worse,

390
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:51,850
right?
There's always some suffering.

391
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:52,684
You can extend others.
There's always some bit of stubbornness 

392
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,534
or rejection that you can pull off 
that'll make your already terrible 

393
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,990
situation worse,
right?

394
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,020
So there's no bottom,
and that seems to me to be right.

395
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:02,854
If he,
if you do just a cursory historical 

396
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,164
analysis,
no matter what terrible account you can 

397
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:09,970
come across with regards to say,
concentration,

398
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,750
camp brutality in some other book,
there's some worst story,

399
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,360
right?
Limited only by the absolute,

400
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,380
the absolute ends of the most brutal 
form of imagination.

401
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,960
All a consequence,
I think of this process,

402
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:23,794
right?
And you can't really say what causes it 

403
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,290
because on the one hand there's 
cowardice and lack of faith,

404
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,124
right?
Anything I don't understand powered his 

405
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,544
pride in lack of faith,
anything I don't understand doesn't 

406
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,334
exist.
Plus I'm not the person to confront it 

407
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:38,884
anyways,
right?

408
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,903
That's the lack of faith.
Each of those things feeds into the 

409
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,730
other and it's very difficult to say 
where it starts.

410
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,523
Ooh.

411
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,643
The thing that's kind of interesting 
about the self referential processes is 

412
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,740
that
they don't have to start dramatically.

413
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,720
Like the loop can start very,
very small and it picks up speed very,

414
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:03,554
very rapidly.
So you imagine you're speaking into a 

415
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,584
tape recorder and the speakers on you 
get too close to the speaker with the 

416
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,130
microphone and you get some feedback.
And if you bring the microphone a little

417
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:13,964
closer,
the feedback develops more and more 

418
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,070
intensely.
It can blow up.

419
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:21,071
The whole system doesn't have to start 
dramatically to move forward very,

420
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,540
very rapidly.
And what that means,

421
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,374
at least in principle,
is that even small mistakes anywhere 

422
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:27,794
along this circle can start the 
development of precisely this kind of 

423
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:32,960
spiral.
And so you'll say,

424
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:33,830
well,
people do,

425
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,280
people need to be abused to become 
totalitarian.

426
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,660
Well,
and the answer to that is no,

427
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:43,280
because everyone's been abused 
sufficiently by Samo currencies in their

428
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:47,240
life to justify taking negative tack on 
the nature of experience.

429
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,811
They say,
well,

430
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:51,200
how cowardly do you have to be in order 
to run away from things?

431
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:51,711
And you think,
well,

432
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:56,390
not that cowardly because under most 
circumstances your life is characterized

433
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,740
by sins of omission,
right?

434
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,574
It's,
there are things you left on done and 

435
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:05,270
like how just exactly how rigid do you 
want your belief systems to be?

436
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,260
And you say,
well,

437
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,990
I like them to be stable because without
that stability,

438
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,540
then I'm terrified.
And then you can say,

439
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,040
well,
fair enough,

440
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,800
but that's all a sign of a kind of 
existential weakness.

441
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,850
And then if social circumstances come 
around and give your life a good tweak,

442
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,310
say like they did with the Germans prior
to World War II,

443
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,950
you just never know what side you're 
going to end up on.

444
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,590
And so all these little tiny mistakes,
you know,

445
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,873
mistakes that I think are marked by your
own conscious are precisely that leads 

446
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,290
you down this terrible path.

447
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,371
And if you think,
well,

448
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,720
no,
that can't be right.

449
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,630
Well then you have to remember that in 
these processes,

450
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:39,464
say of d Kula causation and that immense
wave of desks that characterize the 

451
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,570
Soviet Union.
And the Nazi Germany,

452
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,350
most people were involved and if they 
weren't involved,

453
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,933
indirect acts of commission,
they were absolutely involved in direct 

454
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,890
acts of omission,
right?

455
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,500
They knew,
but they didn't say anything.

456
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,203
Well,
classically sins of commission or 

457
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:03,650
regarded as much more evil say than sins
of omission.

458
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,663
But I actually think that's backwards.
The sins of omission are worse because 

459
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:12,640
every time you walk away and what do you
do when you walk away from a Nazi?

460
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,680
What are you walking away from?
Well,

461
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,780
we know what you're walking away from,
right?

462
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,763
If you're walking away from
a domain that's likely to expand into 

463
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:26,931
something that's completely
undifferentiatable from hell and it's no

464
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:29,364
wonder you'd walk away from that,
but the fact that you walk away from it 

465
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,140
makes it much more likely that it's 
going to happen.

466
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,110
Okay,

467
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,080
so then I think to end this,
something like this,

468
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,210
okay,

469
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,360
we look for economic reasons to explain 
great,

470
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,040
terrible acts,
right?

471
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,400
We look for social reasons,
we look for political reasons,

472
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,350
but we have niches,
observation,

473
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,184
which is something like this.
I don't care whether or not your life's 

474
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:57,110
been characterized by suffering and 
deprivation.

475
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,800
The mere fact of suffering and 
deprivation does not allow you to draw a

476
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,040
particular conclusion.
You can't say that there's a causal path

477
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,874
between economic deprivation say,
and the rise of a totalitarian state 

478
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
because any events susceptible to 
multiple interpretations.

479
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,920
Well,
how do these states come about?

480
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,001
Well,
I think,

481
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:14,834
well,
we look for political and economic and 

482
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,370
social reasons because that's the 
easiest place to look,

483
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,204
right?
If you ratchet up the level of 

484
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:24,710
description to social forces that are 
beyond your control,

485
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,693
then you never have to worry about what 
it is that you're doing or not doing 

486
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,420
this actually causing this sort of 
thing.

487
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,060
But I think if you look at the 
historical record,

488
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,240
especially if you look at it from a 
mythological perspective,

489
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:38,810
the stories basically clear and it,
it goes something like this.

490
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Every time you make a mistake that you 
know is a mistake and you don't fix it,

491
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,930
the world moves more towards that.
And it might be trivial maybe,

492
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,690
but it might not be.
So you look at Adolf Eichmann,

493
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,940
for example,
who is the little bureaucrat who planned

494
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:58,110
the final solution and you find out he's
just your little ratty guy,

495
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,700
right?
You see him in a bar.

496
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,850
You don't even notice him.
He's a negligible nobody.

497
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,120
But he's the guy who planned the final 
solution.

498
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,370
He was a normal person.
I mean,

499
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,010
maybe even slightly less than normal,
right?

500
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,383
He was no monster.
He wasn't the sort of person you'd 

501
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,770
remark on if you saw him.
Precisely the opposite.

502
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
Invisible,
quiet,

503
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,060
unassuming,
presuming.

504
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:21,894
No doubt that at least until he was 
arrested that he was just doing what he 

505
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,720
was told.
And that was just fine.
