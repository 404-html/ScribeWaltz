1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,550
So the first thing I want to show you is
this thing called a golden board.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,613
Now they have the,
this was worked out by Francis Gulf 

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,170
who's actually quite an interesting 
person.

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,004
You'll,
you'll see if you hear about Francis 

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,733
Galton,
you'll often hear that he was the first 

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:21,150
person he tried to measure human 
intelligence.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:21,984
But that's actually not true.
What golden tried to do was measure 

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,830
human eminence and he thought of eminent
says,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,180
I suppose something like high position 
in the cultural dominance hierarchy.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,223
And this was back in Victorian England 
in the late 18 hundreds and so eminence 

11
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,990
would have been intellectual 
achievement,

12
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,250
financial achievement,
um,

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,760
cultural achievement,
achievement,

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,594
broadly speaking,
but really considered within the 

15
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:50,850
confines of a dominance hierarchy.
So at that point in time,

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,103
the English regarded themselves as the 
prime nation and ethnicity on the 

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,374
planet.
And then the aristocratic Englishman 

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,863
regarded themselves as the prime human 
beings in that prime country and 

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,730
ethnicity.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,290
And so it was really an idea that would 
be more associated with,

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,173
with dominance hierarchy,
upper most dominant hierarchy position 

22
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:17,970
than anything we would conceptualize as 
intelligence today.

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,570
And Goldberg,
our golden was a polymath.

24
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,404
He was a genius in many,
many fields and got very interested in 

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,190
the idea of measuring human differences.
And uh,

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,993
he tried to determine whether the 
differences that he could measure in 

27
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,040
some of those things where like reaction
time and height and,

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,710
and uh,
uh,

29
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,190
physical fitness and,
um,

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,180
I can't remember all the other things 
that he attempted to measure,

31
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,014
but he wanted to see if any of those 
things could be used to predict 

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,260
eminence.
Um,

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,133
it turned out that they couldn't,
partly because eminence is not the kind 

34
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,930
of category that you can make into a 
scientific category.

35
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,623
Um,
and partly because his measurement 

36
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:07,200
instruments in many ways weren't 
sensitive enough.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,033
He didn't make enough measurements and 
the statistics weren't sufficiently 

38
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,634
sophisticated.
But the idea that you could measure 

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,653
elementary attributes and that you could
use them to predict something important 

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,793
was still an important idea.
And it's one of those examples in 

41
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,540
science,
sort of like phrenology.

42
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,850
I mean everyone makes fun of phrenology.
Now.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,893
You know,
the idea that you could read someone's 

44
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:34,200
character by mapping out the protrusions
and depths and so forth on the,

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,690
on their skull,
it sounds

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,790
ridiculous to modern ears,
but there was,

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,624
again,
there was some idea behind it and that 

48
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,304
was the idea that critical functions 
could be localized and that cognitive 

49
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,670
functions could be differentiated into 
separate functions.

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,670
We still do that.
We think of emotions and motivations and

51
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,130
personality traits.
And intelligence is,

52
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,860
even though intelligence is,
is not a very good idea,

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,950
the idea that you can differentiate,
um,

54
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,240
human psychological function and then 
that would be related in some way to the

55
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,480
underlying neurological and physical 
architecture.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,673
That's not a stupid idea.
So an idea can be very intelligent at 

57
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,700
one level of analysis and not so 
intelligent that the others.

58
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,534
So I would say the problem with that 
phenologist was actually a problem of 

59
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,900
operationalization.
They had the theory right in some sense,

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,900
but they didn't have the measures right.
Um,

61
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,140
now one of the things Bolton who came up
with was the normal,

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,900
he came up with this thing called the 
golden board.

63
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,670
And a golden board demonstrates how a 
normal distribution is produced.

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,450
Now basically what the normal 
distribution is a,

65
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,943
an axiomatic,
it's an axiom of modern statistics and 

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,703
every system has to have its axioms.
And the axiom of normal distribution is 

67
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,244
basically the idea that around any 
measurement there's going to be a set 

68
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,244
of,
there's going to be variations in 

69
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,560
measurement and those measurements are 
basically going to be random.

70
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,663
And then another axiom is that extreme 
outlying measurements are going to be 

71
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:11,680
rare and small outlying measurements are
going to be more common.

72
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,210
So you can imagine,
um,

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,800
if I measured any one of you a hundred 
times with,

74
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,640
uh,
with,

75
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,110
uh,
let's say with a tape measure,

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm going to get a set of variables that
are not always exactly the same.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,653
And so there'll be an average and then 
there'll be some deviation around that 

78
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,074
average.
And if I looked at a hundred 

79
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,680
measurements that I took of each of one 
of you,

80
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,020
then I would get a normal distribution 
around that,

81
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,243
that distribution,
and that's sort of the fuzziness of the 

82
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,604
mean.
Now that might be partly because my 

83
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,990
measurement instrument isn't very 
accurate.

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,063
It might be partly because at some point
when you're being measured for the 50th 

85
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,714
time you're slouching a little bit or 
maybe other times you standing up a bit 

86
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,654
straighter or maybe I measure you in the
morning sometimes and in the evening at 

87
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,590
other times.

88
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,620
If you're actually taller in the morning
than you are in the evening because your

89
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,570
spine has a chance to decompress at 
night,

90
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,240
so maybe that adds half an inch to your 
height in the morning.

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,133
And so there's,
there's going to be shifting and 

92
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,324
movement around the,
around the central tendency around the 

93
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:11,860
average.
Now if I turns out,

94
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,890
if I measure all of you,
the same thing's going to happen.

95
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,660
What we're going to get is an average 
height,

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,630
which would be the average height of the
people in this room,

97
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,464
and then there's going to be a 
distribution had basically a normal 

98
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,044
distribution.
Those of you who are much taller than 

99
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,104
the average are going to be much fewer 
than those of you that are close to the 

100
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:29,854
average,
and those of you that are much shorter 

101
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,194
than the average are going to be.
There's going to be far fewer of you 

102
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,080
than there are going to be.

103
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,830
Those of you who are just somewhat 
smaller than the average.

104
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,933
Now,
generally the idea of a normal 

105
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:46,951
distribution is predicated on the idea 
that the variation around the average is

106
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,274
actually random and that's an important 
thing because the variation around that 

107
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:56,230
average is not always random.
Now,

108
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,064
psychologists will tell you and and so 
what most social scientists who use 

109
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,550
classical statistics that the normal 
distribution is the norm.

110
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,384
Or maybe they'll say more than that,
is that it's the standard case that 

111
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,284
whatever set of variables you measure is
going to come out in a normal 

112
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,960
distribution.
And that means that you can apply all of

113
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,794
the stats that you're going to learn to 
decompose the world and reconstruct it 

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,470
to your data sets because the data sets 
will fit the assumptions of the,

115
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,010
of the,
um,

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,420
statistics.
The problem with that is that it's often

117
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,254
wrong.

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,393
Now,
I asked you guys to buy the Black Swan 

119
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,580
and we haven't talked about the black 
swan much yet,

120
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,370
and I'm not going to test you on it,
but I would recommend that you,

121
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,623
that you read it,
especially if you're interested in 

122
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,700
psychology because you gotta watch your 
axioms.

123
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,360
And the idea that the normal 
distribution might not always be correct

124
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,510
and certainly might not be a correct 
description of your data,

125
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,290
is a fundamentally important idea.
Because if it's wrong,

126
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,090
if your doubt isn't normally 
distributed,

127
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,193
then the phenomena that you're looking 
at isn't what you think it is and the 

128
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,820
statistics that you're going to use 
aren't going to work.

129
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,223
Now this came as quite a puzzle to me at
one point because it turned out that 

130
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:09,824
when we,
when we produced the creative 

131
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,330
achievement questionnaire,
um,

132
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,280
you know,
and,

133
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,200
and you'd think I would've known better 
if by this time,

134
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,610
cause it was,
it wasn't that long ago.

135
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,240
It was like 15 years ago.
The data never came back,

136
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,074
normally distributed.
It came back distributed enough in that 

137
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,553
what they call a pareto distribution,
which is everyone stacks up on the 

138
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,610
lefthand side and the,
the curve drifts off to the right.

139
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,444
And that's one of those curves where 
almost everyone has zero or one and a 

140
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,390
smaller minority.
People have very high scores.

141
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,913
Now when you get a prieto distribution,
there's something going on that's not 

142
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,960
random and that doesn't mean you can 
ignore it.

143
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,794
Now,
one of the things that psychologists 

144
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,384
will do sometimes if they get a 
distribution that's not random is 

145
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,984
they'll do it.
And mathematical transformation like a 

146
00:07:55,461 --> 00:08:00,200
log rhythmic transformation to pull in 
the outliers and to try to make the data

147
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,090
fit the normal distribution.
Again,

148
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,403
assuming that there's some kind of 
measurement error there or that the 

149
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,760
scales got a logarithmic function,
um,

150
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,073
it isn't always obvious that that's a 
useful and appropriate thing to do 

151
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,293
because it's the case in many situations
where the extremeness of the 

152
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,230
distribution is actually an accurate 
representation of,

153
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,390
of the way that that phenomena behaves 
in nature.

154
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,750
Now I want to show you how a normal 
distribution works.

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,920
Um,
have,

156
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,023
have you ever,
have any of you ever seen a 

157
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,874
demonstration of why a normal 
distribution is normal in why it takes 

158
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,750
the shape it takes?
Does anybody ever seen that?

159
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,243
No.
It's weird day because you think that 

160
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,074
given it's unbelievable importance,
especially in psychology where 

161
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:51,080
everything we do is measured and has an 
average in a standard deviation,

162
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,830
that there'd be some investigation into 
why we make that presupposition.

163
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
There's a great book.
One Book I would recommend for those of 

164
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,900
you who might be interested in 
psychology is a career.

165
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,360
There's a book called a history of 
statistical thinking.

166
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,180
Now you'd think Jesus,
if there's not anything more boring than

167
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,000
statistics,
it's gotta be the history of statistics.

168
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,310
But it turns out that that's really 
wrong.

169
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,593
I mean,
the history of statistics is actually 

170
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,100
the history of the social sciences and 
not only of the social sciences,

171
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:17,934
because statistics became not,
statistics was actually initially 

172
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,040
invented by cosmologists who are 
measuring planetary position.

173
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,413
And then the statistical processes that 
have been used to underpin modern 

174
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:34,050
science have been tossed back and forth,
weirdly enough,

175
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,070
between social scientists and physicists
over about the last 200 years.

176
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:42,720
Because the physicists ended up having 
to describe the world from a statistical

177
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,590
perspective,
right?

178
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:47,430
Because if you go down into the realm of
the atomic and subatomic particles,

179
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:50,040
what you find is that things behave 
statistically down there.

180
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,060
They don't behave deterministically and 
it's the same at the level of the,

181
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,370
of the human scale.
You know,

182
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,650
we behave statistically not 
deterministically.

183
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,484
So you know,
sometimes you hear this old idea that 

184
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,290
that psychology has physics envy or 
something like that.

185
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,124
But it turned out that for much of the 
history of the development of 

186
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:11,070
statistical ideas,
physics had psychology envy,

187
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,040
which I think is quite funny.
So anyways,

188
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,874
if you look at this book,
historic history of statistical 

189
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,143
thinking,
you can see how the idea that 

190
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,043
populations could have behavior in that 
populations could be measured and that 

191
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,304
the idea that states like political 
states could be measured and that human 

192
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,690
behavior could be measured.

193
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,440
And I didn't realize until I wrote,
I read this book that,

194
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,740
um,
how revolutionary the idea of statistics

195
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,770
actually was because of course it's part
of the idea of measurement.

196
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,970
So I had this very interesting client at
one point,

197
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:48,190
he was an old guy and he'd been a 
psychologist and that finance,

198
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,180
you're anna statistician and he was in 
love with mathematics.

199
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,440
You know,
he was one of these guys who,

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,800
who for whom mathematical equations had 
this immediate glimmer of beauty.

201
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:00,474
And he made this very interesting little
gold sculpture that I have up at my 

202
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,624
office,
that that's a representation of what 

203
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:10,020
people claim to be the most perfect 
mathematical equation ever constructed.

204
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,854
And He,
so we made this little gadgets like a 

205
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,990
religious icon almost.
And,

206
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,990
and that's really what he thought of it.
And,

207
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,490
um,
uh,

208
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,570
I'm afraid foolishly enough that I can't
tell you the name of the equation.

209
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,860
Some of you might know it,
it,

210
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,120
it relates I e and Pi.
Is there anybody in here who yes.

211
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,490
What is that?
Yes.

212
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:35,491
And what is that equation?
Okay.

213
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:37,480
And do you,
do you,

214
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,000
do you know why it's such a remarkable 
equations?

215
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,560
I won

216
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,570
in one equation,
right?

217
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,500
So he thought that that in some sense 
this equation summed up the magnificence

218
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,334
of the mathematical universe.
And so it was so funny cause he also 

219
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,910
made little pins that people could wear 
of this,

220
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,070
of this equation that we are also made 
out of gold.

221
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:01,090
And there was another person in our 
department at that point and uh,

222
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,160
I was wearing this pin around and she 
said,

223
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,420
oh well she told me what the equation,
but she pointed,

224
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:06,254
you did that.
And she got all excited because it was 

225
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,044
this perfect equation that related all 
these fundamental constants to one and 

226
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,640
zero.
So anyways,

227
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,040
he taught me a lot of this while he was 
a client of mine.

228
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,070
He was very much obsessed with Matt 
mathematical ideas.

229
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:18,904
He couldn't get them out of his head.
It was a true obsession and a useful 

230
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:22,120
one.

231
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,953
But he had,
he taught me a lot of things about 

232
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,170
statistics that I just never knew it 
all.

233
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,393
And,
uh,

234
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,040
one of them was the prieto distribution,
which would just,

235
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,780
it just staggered me that I didn't know 
it.

236
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,820
I only learned this stuff about five or 
six years ago,

237
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,160
and it just made me feel like a complete
moron because I've,

238
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,200
you know,
gone through men,

239
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,190
Manz,
Manz,

240
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,024
mother's psychological training.
And I was measuring things like 

241
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,490
prefrontal ability and intelligence and 
personality and creativity.

242
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:49,324
And then in the creativity measurement,
I stumbled into these prieto 

243
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,350
distributions.
I thought they were bloodied mistake.

244
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,070
I didn't know what the hell they were.
You know,

245
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:55,904
when I've also found economists who 
didn't know about the credo 

246
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,830
distribution,
which is pretty bloody bizarre thing,

247
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,310
like it really is a strange thing.
So anyways,

248
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,900
one of the things he showed me is how 
the normal distribution comes about.

249
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,740
And,
uh,

250
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,070
I had a student who did a phd thesis on 
Gulfton,

251
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,260
so I knew something about golden at this
point.

252
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,290
He was,
he was doing a part of his thesis on the

253
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,210
history of the measurement of 
intelligence.

254
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
And a golden was a key figure in the 
establishment of that sort of 

255
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,574
measurement.
So,

256
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,633
um,
but this is one of the things gotten 

257
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,920
invented.
So let's take a look at it here.

258
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,223
Okay.
So that's your basic rock and roll 

259
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,890
golden board apparently.
So let me show you a picture of,

260
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,070
of a golf board so you'd get a better 
sense of exactly what is doing.

261
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,173
So there's a good one right there.
Let's see if we can make that a little 

262
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,560
bigger.
Yeah.

263
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,490
So basically all that happens within 
Goldman board is that you have a,

264
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,743
you got a bunch of pains on a board.
It's the board is horizontal and you 

265
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:27,854
dropped balls down at marbles or 
whatever it is and the marbles come in 

266
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:35,480
one place and then they bounced down the
pins and they distribute themselves in a

267
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,220
normal distribution.
Now,

268
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,054
the reason they do that is because there
are far more ways of getting down the 

269
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,190
middle.
Then there are of getting either side.

270
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,623
Now you see,
because to get to the only to the right 

271
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,370
side,
say the ball has to go write,

272
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:49,851
write,
write,

273
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:50,361
write,
write,

274
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:50,841
write,
write,

275
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,674
write and then fall in the Little Cup 
and then on the left it has to do 

276
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,120
exactly the same thing.

277
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,820
There's only one way it can do that,
right?

278
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,010
But to get into the middle,
it can go left,

279
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:01,581
right,
left,

280
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,181
right,
left,

281
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:02,780
right,
right,

282
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,220
left,
et cetera.

283
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,830
There's a,
there's a far greater number of pathways

284
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,780
for the ball to go from the middle down 
to the middle.

285
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,550
Then there is for the bowl to go to the 
sites.

286
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:11,384
And so all that means fundamentally is 
that the probability that a given ball 

287
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,524
is going to land in the middle or near 
the middle is much higher than the 

288
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,600
probability that a ball is going to land
in the extremes.

289
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,913
And so it's just a description of how 
random processes laid themselves out 

290
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,840
around a mean.
Okay,

291
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,674
so that's a normal distribution.
Now if you have normal distribution one 

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,360
and you have normal distribution to,
you can overlap them.

293
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,733
Right?
And if they overlap perfectly the mean 

294
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,650
and the standard deviation or the same,
then there's nothing different about,

295
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,873
you know,
cause one thing you want to ask as well 

296
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,970
are how do you know if two means are 
different?

297
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,803
And the answer is you don't know unless 
you know what the means are measuring 

298
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,653
and you don't know what the means are 
measuring unless you know the variation 

299
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:53,894
of the measurement.
And so you have to know what the mean 

300
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,834
and the standard deviation.
So the standard deviation is like the 

301
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:03,671
width of the meme in some sense.
And all statistics do generally take one

302
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:04,684
normal distribution and another and slap
them on top of each other and then 

303
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,083
measure how far apart they are,
how much they overlap and correct that 

304
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,314
for the sample size.
And then you can tell if the two 

305
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:19,240
distributions are different,
significantly different.

306
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,223
So what you would do is you'd run a 
whole bunch of normal distribution 

307
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,373
processes by chance and you're going to 
get a distribution of distributions in 

308
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,594
some sense.
And then you can tell what the 

309
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:34,270
probability is that the normal 
distribution that you drew for group aid

310
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,510
is the same as the normal distribution 
that you drew for group B.

311
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,733
And that's all there is basically to s 
two standard group comparison 

312
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:42,820
statistics.

313
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,480
And that's how we decide when we have a 
significant defect.

314
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:50,400
If there's a significant difference 
between two groups or better still,

315
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,893
if you randomly assign people to groups 
and then you do an experimental 

316
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,590
manipulation and then you measure the 
outcome,

317
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,453
the means,
then you can test to see whether your 

318
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:01,854
experimental manipulation produced an 
effect that would be greater than 

319
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,430
chance.
And then you infer that,

320
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,050
well there's a low probability one in 20
that you would,

321
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,813
you would,
um,

322
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,900
produce that effect if you were just 
running random simulations.

323
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,943
And therefore you can say with some 
certainty that there's an actual causal 

324
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:25,170
effect that's with an experimental 
model.

325
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,060
Now,
hey,

326
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,050
you know,
why do you think,

327
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,700
all right,
let's say,

328
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,773
let me give you a conundrum.
So I used to study people who were sons 

329
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,870
of male alcoholics.
Okay?

330
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,600
Now there was a reason for that.
We didn't have women.

331
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,090
Why might that be?
We didn't use women.

332
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,790
Why,
why,

333
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,090
why would they be confounding part from 
the fact that they're women?

334
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,660
I supposed to be a joke.
You know,

335
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,300
Jesus,
it's a better joke than that.

336
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,373
Okay.

337
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Well it could be that it was some sort 
of emotional coping mechanism difference

338
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,503
between the way that deal with the 
father daughter relationship is 

339
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:09,650
different then.

340
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,311
Okay.
Well so that,

341
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,790
that's a part that's not about Aaronson 
but it's,

342
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,320
it's not the answer that was appropriate
for our research.

343
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,154
And I'll tell you why because you 
couldn't infer it from the question we 

344
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:23,561
were interested in what factors made 
alcoholism hereditary cause it does seem

345
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,674
to have a strong hereditary component.
And what we basically concluded after 

346
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:28,364
doing a tremendous amount of research 
was that people who are prone to 

347
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:31,994
alcoholism,
at least one type of person who's prone 

348
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,740
to one type of alcoholism,
God,

349
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,574
a very,
very powerful stimulant effect from the 

350
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:44,801
alcohol during the time that their blood
alcohol level was ascending in the 10 or

351
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,124
15 minutes after they took a drink.
Especially if they took a large drink 

352
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,660
faxed or multiple large drinks fat.
You can probably tell.

353
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,310
By the way,
if you're one of these people,

354
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,400
if you want to go do this and the bar 
the next time you go,

355
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,390
go on an empty stomach,
take your pulse,

356
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,800
write it down,
drink three or four shots fast,

357
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,890
wait 10 minutes,
take your pulse again.

358
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,620
If it's gone up,
10 or 15 beats a minute,

359
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,073
look out because that means alcohol is 
working as a psychomotor stimulant for 

360
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,274
you.
And we found that for many of these 

361
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:24,170
people that was an opiate effect.
What seemed to happen was that when they

362
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:28,280
drank alcohol fast,
they produced probably Beta endorphin,

363
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:31,940
although that we were never sure we can.
It can be blocked with Naltrexone,

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,640
which is an opiate antagonist.
Anyways.

365
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,540
The other characteristic of that pattern
of,

366
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,620
of,
of alcohol consumption is that the,

367
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,454
the real kick only occurs when you're on
the ascending limb of the blood alcohol 

368
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:47,261
curve.
So you know,

369
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:48,094
first of all,
your blood alcohol goes up and then it 

370
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,210
goes down.
And generally when it goes down,

371
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,044
it's not pleasant.
That's when you start to feel hung over 

372
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,660
and hangovers actually alcohol 
withdrawal by the way.

373
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,090
So it's like heroin withdrawal,
acceptance,

374
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:01,924
alcohol withdrawal,
and it's generally not pleasant for 

375
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,060
people.

376
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,720
So they usually sleep through it or it 
puts them to sleep.

377
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,990
But if you're one of these people who 
get a real kick on the ascending limb of

378
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,690
the blood alcohol curve,
then you can just keep pounding back the

379
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:14,524
alcohol and it'll keep hitting you and 
keep you in that position where you're 

380
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,851
at.
You know,

381
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,370
on the on ass ending part of the blood 
alcohol curve.

382
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:23,170
And you can probably tell if you're one 
of these people,

383
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:26,350
if you can't stop once you get started,
you know,

384
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,080
so if it's like you have four drinks 
quick and it's like,

385
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,973
man,
you're gone until the alcohol runs out 

386
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:32,944
or until it's four in the morning or 
till you've spent all your money or 

387
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:35,914
you've been at last bar in town or that 
you're sitting on your friend's bed 

388
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,620
after everybody's going home from the 
party and you're still drinking,

389
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,170
you might suspect that you're one of 
those people.

390
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,333
And if you are one of those people,
well then you should watch the halo 

391
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,660
because,
um,

392
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,420
alcohol is a vicious drug.
And it,

393
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,433
it gets people in its grasp hard and 
it's hard for them to escape once they 

394
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,590
do.
People also drink to quell anxiety.

395
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,053
So now the problem,
because we were looking at the genetics 

396
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,654
of alcoholism,
it wasn't easy to study offspring of 

397
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:09,364
alcoholic mothers.
And the reason for that is they might 

398
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:16,621
have consumed alcohol during pregnancy,
in which case that's a bad idea.

399
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Especially there's certain key times in 
pregnancy were even a few drinks are not

400
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,550
good.
And that's turns out,

401
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,384
if I remember correctly,
that turns out to be the times when the 

402
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,070
fetus is producing the bulk of its 
hippocampus tissue.

403
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,413
And so anyways,
so if it turned out that daughters or 

404
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:39,121
sons of female alcoholics were markedly 
different from the general population in

405
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:41,164
some manner,
we wouldn't be able to tell if that was 

406
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:47,290
a consequence of alcohol consumption 
during pregnancy or if it was,

407
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,850
it was a genetic reflection.

408
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,923
So what we want it to do was study sons 
of male alcoholics and so their mothers 

409
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:57,910
actually couldn't be alcoholic and we 
wanted their fathers,

410
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,960
the best subjects had an alcoholic 
father and an alcoholic grandfather.

411
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,003
And at least one or more alcoholics,
first or second degree male relatives 

412
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,510
and they couldn't be alcoholic and they 
had to be young.

413
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,410
So because obviously if they were 40 and
they still work alcoholic,

414
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,550
then they probably weren't going to be 
alcoholic.

415
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,400
So we wanted to catch them,
you know,

416
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:21,040
between say well it had to be 18,
which was,

417
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,340
it was in Quebec.
That was even a little late probably.

418
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,174
But you know,
that's best we could do from an ethical 

419
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,214
perspective.
So we used to bring these guys into the 

420
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,330
lab and get them quite drunk.
Um,

421
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,780
the National Institute of Alcohol is,
I'm an alcohol abuse,

422
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:39,280
pretty much put a stop to that research 
because we used to bring them in and you

423
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,870
know,
we'd get their blood alcohol level up to

424
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,580
0.1,
2.1.

425
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,413
It had to be pretty high.
It actually looked like the real 

426
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,840
physiological effects seem to kick in 
when,

427
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:51,110
uh,
when people hit legal intoxication.

428
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,363
So you don't really get the opiate 
effect till you park yourself up about 

429
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:57,260
point your weight,
which was the legal limit for driving at

430
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,730
that point.
Um,

431
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,280
so we used to get,
some of these guys were pretty big.

432
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:04,580
They come in there and maybe 230 pound 
guys to get them up to,

433
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,013
you know,
0.1 or 0.2 you had or 0.12 you had to 

434
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,200
give them quite a bit credit,
lack of alcohol and then what we usually

435
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,034
do is we let them sober up till the 
point it will six bout that and then 

436
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:19,880
we'd send them home in a cap.
Well when the Eni Aaa got all ethical on

437
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,714
the whole situation,
they wouldn't let us send them home 

438
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,840
until they hit 0.02.

439
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,771
It was like,
well,

440
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,604
if you're a 240 pounds and we've just 
nailed you with enough alcohol so that 

441
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,780
your blood alcohol level hit 0.12 you're
going to be sitting in our bloody lab,

442
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:33,614
bored to death,
feeling horrible for like six hours or 

443
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:38,430
seven hours and you'd be pretty damn 
irritated about it.

444
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:41,720
It's like it wasn't obvious how we were 
supposed to keep the people there.

445
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,440
It's like,
well,

446
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,820
can I leave?
No,

447
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,043
I'm not paying you if you leave.
It's like that's going to produce real 

448
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:49,970
positive outcomes,
but with like drunk people in the lab,

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,833
that's going to work really well.
Of course then they never come back 

450
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,980
either because it was such a bloody 
awful experience.

451
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,110
So I stopped doing that research partly 
because it became impossible anyways,

452
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,063
we did find out a lot.
We found out that there was this one 

453
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:07,970
particular pattern of of alcohol abuse 
that seemed to be hereditary,

454
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,520
so every couldn't study it.
Women.

455
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,923
Anyway,
so now there was a problem with this 

456
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,440
line of research and the problem was,
well,

457
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,350
alcoholism comes along with other 
problems.

458
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,990
So this was correlational research,
right?

459
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,470
We take,
we,

460
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,373
we,
we pick a group of people and we've 

461
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:29,750
matched them.
The sons of male alcoholics,

462
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:33,230
we'd match them with people who weren't 
sons of male alcoholics.

463
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,480
So they were still sons.
They were still the same age,

464
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,870
but their fathers weren't the alcoholic.
Now here's the problem.

465
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,690
What should we match them on?

466
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,800
Age,
gender?

467
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,800
Well,
you can't match them on number of drinks

468
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,830
obviously because

469
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,350
you want the people who are alcoholic in
one group,

470
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,543
not to be,
you don't want to alcoholics in the 

471
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:58,974
second group.
So do you match them on number of 

472
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,470
drinks?
Well,

473
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,304
if you don't,
then you don't know if this effect that 

474
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:04,764
you're measuring is a consequence of the
genetic difference or on the number of 

475
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:10,650
drinks per week or drinks per occasion 
that the people had.

476
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,484
Right.
That'd be a confounding variable if you 

477
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,404
match them for antisocial personality or
anti-personnel anti social personality 

478
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:17,814
symptoms because lots of people who are 
alcoholic have they tilt towards the 

479
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:22,404
antisocial side of the spectrum.
So do you control for that while you 

480
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:26,364
don't know because you don't know if 
antisocial personalities part of 

481
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:29,034
alcoholism,
like it's part of the same underlying 

482
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,464
genetic problem or if it's a secondary 
manifestation or if its consequences 

483
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,970
drinking,
you don't know any of that.

484
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,400
Do you match them on depressive 
symptoms?

485
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,250
Do you match them on schooling?
You match them on education.

486
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,263
Do you match them on personality?
Do you match them on other forms of 

487
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:49,110
psychopathology?
Do you match them on what they drink?

488
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:53,160
Do you match them on how many drinks per
occasion they drink when they drink,

489
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,990
et cetera?
Well,

490
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:55,824
the answer to that is you don't know.
And so what that means is there's 

491
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,630
actually an infinite number of potential
covariants

492
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,570
because you don't know what differences 
there are between the two groups are the

493
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:12,450
differences that are relevant to the 
question at hand.

494
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,730
Now that's actually one of the big 
problems with psychiatric research.

495
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:18,564
In fact,
it might be a problem with psychiatric 

496
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,180
research that so serious that it cannot 
be solved.

497
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,493
You know?
So if you take kids who are attention 

498
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:29,600
deficit disorder,
say this is horrible,

499
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,463
diagnosed a criteria and you match them 
with kids who aren't and then you look 

500
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:37,200
to see what the,
what makes the adhd kids different,

501
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,030
what do you match them on?

502
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,210
Well you don't know.
And that is,

503
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,420
so usually what happens is the people 
who do psychiatric research

504
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,323
finance this a bit,
they matched them on the important 

505
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:52,050
variables,
age,

506
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,290
physical health,
maybe education,

507
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,470
but the poor.
The problem is you actually have no idea

508
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,304
what the important variables are.
And there are an unlimited number of 

509
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:02,574
them.
And so that's actually why random ass I 

510
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,980
nation to groups is so important.
Now,

511
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,980
if I take all of you and I say,
well,

512
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,270
let's look at the effects of alcohol.
So what I would do is I'd say you'd come

513
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:20,280
towards me and I do a golden board 
sorting.

514
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,960
You go to the left,
you'd go to the right,

515
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,480
you go to the last,
you go to the right.

516
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,850
This says nonbiased separation of the 
two populations.

517
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,043
And then maybe I'd give one group two 
ounces of alcohol and water and the 

518
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,630
other,
or in coke say,

519
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,583
and in the other group I put a few drops
of alcohol on the top of a glass of 

520
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,040
coke.

521
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,873
So it smelled like alcohol and tasted 
like alcohol when you had your first 

522
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,354
drink.
And then I put you through a whole 

523
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,810
battery of neuropsychological and 
personality tests,

524
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,763
which I did by the way,
to a bunch of people would think it was 

525
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:51,570
the first publication I had back in 
about 85 or something like that.

526
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,793
Um,
random ass I nation gets rid of the 

527
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,010
necessity for the infinite number of 
covariates,

528
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,873
right?
Because you're all different than a 

529
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,524
whole bunch of important ways.
But we can assume as long as I threw 

530
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:07,380
half of you in this group randomly and 
half of you in that group randomly,

531
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,750
then all your various idiosyncrasies,
no matter how many they are,

532
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,584
our would cancel out.
And that's the massive advantage to and 

533
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,460
mass I nation.
Now,

534
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,130
one of the things you're going to notice
when you go through psychology,

535
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,320
especially if you do the 
psychopathological work,

536
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,290
is that the studies are almost always 
correlational.

537
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,210
And they do,
they'll do,

538
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,690
they'll coat,
they'll control for relevant covariates.

539
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:34,590
That's what it will say in the paper.
But the problem is you don't bloody well

540
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,990
know what the ran the relevant 
covariates are.

541
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,150
If you did,
you'd already understand the condition.

542
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,860
You wouldn't have to do the damn 
research.

543
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,123
So you can make a pretty strong case 
that all psychiatric research that is 

544
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:49,720
studying psychopathological groups 
compared to act control,

545
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,613
it's all not interpreted them.
And it turns out in that kind of 

546
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:56,884
research that who should,
who the control should be is the killer 

547
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,020
because you don't know picking the 
psychopathological populations easy,

548
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:08,920
you just pick them according to whatever
diagnostic checklist you happen to use.

549
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,740
But when you figure out who to control 
them against,

550
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,574
it's like,

551
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,930
okay

552
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,480
siblings,
I mean,

553
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,720
what are you,
what do you do?

554
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,583
What do you,
how do you have match a population and 

555
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,720
answer his account.
So anyways,

556
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,600
the reason that we didn't include women 
was because

557
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,860
of the,
of the,

558
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,263
uh,

559
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,443
um,
the uncontrollable potential con 

560
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,430
confounding effects.
And the only way that you can do that is

561
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:36,264
to assign randomly.
And that's an important thing to 

562
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:38,934
remember.
It's why experimental designs are way 

563
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:43,320
more powerful than correlational 
designs.

564
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,900
And the problem is frequently in 
psychology,

565
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:46,734
what you see are correlational designs.
Now I think if you're careful and you 

566
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,150
dig around and,
and you know,

567
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:51,984
you're obsessively careful,
you can extract information out of 

568
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,500
correlational studies,
but it's no,

569
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,100
it's no simple thing to do.
You see this problem come up too.

570
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:01,800
When you hear about studies on Diet,
you know it's like,

571
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,450
well you should eat low fat diet or you 
should eat a high fat diet.

572
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,284
Or usually what happens is they track 
people across time who hypothetically 

573
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:10,044
have been having one diet or the other.
But the problem is you don't know what 

574
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,280
the hell else.
It makes those people different.

575
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,980
And the problem with that is there is an
infinite number of potential things that

576
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:22,830
make them different.
And that's a big problem.

577
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,660
The probability that you've picked,
the one thing that makes people who have

578
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:28,494
a high fat diet different from other 
people and that it happens to be that 

579
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,960
they have a high fat diet.
And that's the only difference.

580
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:35,070
It's like,
yeah,

581
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,490
no,
no,

582
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,380
no,
not at all.

583
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,540
Definitely not.
So,

584
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,580
okay,
so anyways,

585
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,973
random ass I nation gets rid of the 
problem of the infinite number of 

586
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:49,260
covariates and that's worth knowing.
And then the other thing that we've just

587
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:50,760
figured out is that,
you know,

588
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:51,594
if you make a measurement,
you're going to get a distribution 

589
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,230
around the measurement.
And if you do that in two groups,

590
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:56,064
you can check out the overlap between 
the two groups and you can determine 

591
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,484
what the probability is that that 
overlap is there as a consequence of 

592
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,930
chance.
Now you might say,

593
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,243
why not set your probability level two 
like one in 10,000 so you can be 

594
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:12,960
absolutely damn sure that the two groups
don't overlap.

595
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,090
You know,
so why wouldn't you do that?

596
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,133
Why wouldn't you set p equals 0.0001 
instead of p equals 0.05 so that would 

597
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:25,110
be one in a thousand instead of one and 
20 yes,

598
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,423
yes,

599
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,500
that's exactly right.
So you're basically damned if you do and

600
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:32,334
damned if you don't,
which is a very important thing to 

601
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:37,890
remember about life because generally 
when you make a choice of any sort,

602
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,750
there's error and risk on both sides of 
the choice.

603
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,860
Right?
It's really,

604
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,500
really useful to remember that because 
people always ask,

605
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,890
act like their current situation is 
risk-free,

606
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,060
which is never ever the case.
Yeah.

607
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:52,340
So people were trying to figure out,
well,

608
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:56,510
how do we balance the risk of finding 
something that doesn't exist against the

609
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:00,680
risk of not finding something that 
exists and the reason it's one in 20 and

610
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:03,890
why is that?
It's because someone made that guests 40

611
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:06,260
years ago or 50 years ago and it's just 
stuck.

612
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,100
There's no reason.
And so the other thing to notice is that

613
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,660
you want to be careful about the p 
equals 0.05 phenomena.

614
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,493
Because one of the things you'll see is 
that people treat any experimental 

615
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,520
result.
They get,

616
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:23,060
like it's significant if the probability
is 0.05 or less.

617
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,103
And it's not if it's 0.06 or greater.
And that's not smart because the cutoff 

618
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,064
is the cutoff is arbitrary.
You need to know three things to 

619
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:36,520
interpret an experimental result.
It's like you,

620
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,363
it's like you can't calculate the area 
of a triangle without knowing three 

621
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,480
things.
I think it's three things anyways.

622
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,970
Um,
you need to know the number of people in

623
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:48,330
the study.
You need to know the size of the effect.

624
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:49,164
So that would be the relationship 
between two or more variables that 

625
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:51,884
you're interested in looking at and then
you need to know the probability that 

626
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:59,711
you would find that effect size among 
the population of that size by chance.

627
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,170
And you cannot interpret one of those 
numbers without the other two.

628
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,420
It's not possible.
And now psychologists,

629
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:13,040
the status statistician's amongst 
psychologists who have a clue,

630
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,113
I've been jumping up and down for 50 
years trying to get psychologists to 

631
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:22,550
report all three of those every time 
they report anything effect size,

632
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:23,870
which seems logical,
right?

633
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,033
The effect size is the difference 
between the two means divided by the 

634
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,440
standard deviation of the entire of the,
of the pool group.

635
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,753
Well,
you need both of those because it's the 

636
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:39,500
standard deviation that tells you how 
damn big the man the numbers are.

637
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,350
Because what is 70 mean?
Well,

638
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,770
it doesn't mean anything.
70 it's like if I just came out here and

639
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:46,604
said that you,
I could say 70 and 40 are those 

640
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:50,240
different?
Well,

641
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,520
what the hell does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

642
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,440
You need to know what the units are and 
the distribution gives you the units.

643
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,420
And so once you know the units are,
you can say,

644
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,763
well here's how big the differences 
between these two groups and here's the 

645
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:06,110
probability that that would be acquired 
by chance.

646
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,130
And so that's how confident you could be
that it's an actual difference.

647
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,443
And so you want to always report effect 
sizes and most of you are going to be 

648
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:17,480
taught to look at the damn probability.
And that's stupid.

649
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,690
It's like when you want to know how,
how tall,

650
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,150
how much difference there isn't height 
between two people.

651
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:25,520
You want to know how much difference 
there is in height.

652
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,870
You also might want to know to what 
degree that's there because of chance.

653
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,930
But it's the effect size.
That's the critical variable.

654
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,793
Now you can't understand the effect size
without understanding how many subjects 

655
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,184
were in the experiment and also the 
probability that you would acquire that 

656
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,990
by chance.
So you want to keep that in mind.

657
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,300
And when you're reading scientific 
papers,

658
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,980
you want to be looking at the effect 
size,

659
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,230
how large an effect size is this?

660
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,640
Now I teach all the effect sizes are you
can transform one into another.

661
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:54,474
So yeah,
of correlation coefficients which go up 

662
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:56,694
to one,
you have the square of the correlation 

663
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,024
coefficient,
which is the amount of variance that's 

664
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,973
accounted for.
And that also goes up to one and you 

665
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,620
have your basic correlation.
Your basic correlation coefficients are,

666
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,550
sorry,
your,

667
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:13,551
your standard deviation effect sizes,
which is mean one minus mean to over the

668
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:18,561
standard deviation of the entire group.
And so large effect sizes and psychology

669
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,794
I've talked to you about this before,
are correlation coefficients of about 

670
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:27,420
0.5 or above or r squared's of 25% of 
the variance,

671
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:32,421
which is 0.5 squared or um,
uh mean one minus mean two of say half a

672
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:35,694
standard deviation or greater.
And you can derive that conclusion that 

673
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:40,404
those are relatively large effect sizes 
by looking at the distribution of the 

674
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:46,290
effect sizes across the published 
literature.

675
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,783
And most of you will be told estimates 
for effect sizes that are actually way 

676
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:55,260
too large because those were guests as 
to how big is a large effect size.

677
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:57,510
Well,
some statistician guessed 50 years ago.

678
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,600
So it's just like the point of five 
rule.

679
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,850
It's arbitrary,
but doesn't mean it's stupid,

680
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:05,100
but it's arbitrary and you don't want to
get stuck on it.

681
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,550
Like it's like it's some sort of fact.
Okay,

682
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,503
so

683
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,663
now

684
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,870
let's look at um,
pareto distribution.

685
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,513
Okay?
The first thing you're going to see 

686
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:47,090
about a prieto distribution,
because it's definitely not normal.

687
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,373
Now,

688
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,460
one of the things that I mentioned to 
you before,

689
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,000
but I want to hammer this home because 
it's,

690
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,093
it's unbelievably important for 
determining how to understand the way 

691
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,834
the world lays itself out.
And how do we interpret the way that 

692
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:06,480
people distribute themselves in terms of
their success across time.

693
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,950
Now,
this is a,

694
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,520
this is a fundamental law and I'll,
I'll show you how it works.

695
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:12,354
Okay?
So their law is most of you get nothing 

696
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:16,560
in a few of you get everything,
okay?

697
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,990
So that's the law.
Now you might say,

698
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:19,824
well that's because of,
you might attribute that to various 

699
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,490
things.
So for example,

700
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,200
if you're a left wing,
your,

701
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,034
you attribute to it,
to the inequities of the social 

702
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,910
structure.
And if you're a right winger,

703
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:34,620
you basically attributed to the fact 
that while most people are not that good

704
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,700
at anything,
it's no wonder they end up with nothing.

705
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,980
So they're not very smart and they're 
not very hardworking,

706
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,190
so they don't get very much of whatever 
it is that thereafter.

707
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,593
Okay?
So

708
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,500
we'll take that apart a little bit.
But before we do that,

709
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,330
I want to show you an animation.
Now

710
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,120
you got to watch this wound care for the
hell.

711
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:53,954
Yes.
That's

712
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,650
okay.
Yeah,

713
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,010
this thing moves very,
very quickly.

714
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:05,844
So

715
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,860
go back to the beginning and
all right now.

716
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,050
So here's the deal.
Each of you gets $10 okay?

717
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:21,580
So that's a non random starting likes,
right?

718
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,370
You're all starting in the same place.
That's definitely not random,

719
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,140
okay?
Now here,

720
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,310
here's how you play this game.
You flip a coin,

721
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:31,630
you turn to your partner and you flip a 
coin.

722
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,520
And if,
uh,

723
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,600
it both comes up heads,
then you win and they lose.

724
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,210
And if it comes up tails and heads,
then you lose and they win.

725
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,450
And if the winner gets a dollar from the
loser,

726
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,943
okay?
And so you can imagine that this is a 

727
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:48,190
simulation.
So basically it's like your age training

728
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:50,080
bananas.
If you,

729
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,340
if you,
if you,

730
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:52,840
uh,
give away a banana,

731
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,733
then you're done with the banana.
So one of your walkaway with 11 and one 

732
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:01,180
of you will walk away with nine and then
you turn to someone else who just wander

733
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,400
around the room and randomly trade.
Okay?

734
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,690
So what happens?
Well,

735
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:06,610
the first thing that happens is this.

736
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,770
Okay?
So we started the graph with everyone at

737
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,300
10.
No,

738
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,880
you've done a bunch of trades.
Um,

739
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,530
we don't know how many trades you've 
done,

740
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:20,140
but a fair number.
And so what happens,

741
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,123
what you see happening is some winners 
are starting to emerge right on the 

742
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,664
right hand side.
Those are the people who've won every 

743
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,810
single trade.
Maybe they've traded 10 times,

744
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:31,930
so now they have 20.
And then there's the people on the other

745
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,190
side who've lost nine out of the last 
trades.

746
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,760
Now what?
What happens when you lose nine?

747
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,680
What's the big problem that you have?

748
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,380
What happens?
You only have $1 left.

749
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,090
So what happens if you lose another 
trade?

750
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,273
That's right,
you hit zero and zero is not a number 

751
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:59,610
like any other number.
Zero is like the black hole of numbers.

752
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,730
You fall into the zero hole and that's 
it.

753
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,910
You're not in the game anymore.
And poverty is like that.

754
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,870
It's like that.
It's a kind of a trap and it's very,

755
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:12,390
very difficult to get out of.
So,

756
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,310
and it seems to be in part because once 
you fall off the charts enough,

757
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,950
a bunch of things start conspiring 
against you.

758
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,390
So for example,
um,

759
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,770
you don't have enough money to buy a 
large amount of decent food cheaply,

760
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,770
so you have to buy expensive junk food 
in short term.

761
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,310
So that might be one possibility.
Or let's say you end up on the street,

762
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,173
well you can't even get a job then 
because you don't have an address and 

763
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,460
you can't get social security because 
you don't have an address.

764
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,640
Like things start to conspire against 
you very badly.

765
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:47,474
Or maybe you're unemployed,
you've been unemployed for a year and a 

766
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,630
half because it's been a prolonged 
downturn in the economy.

767
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,090
Well,
if you're 17,

768
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:56,924
who the hell cares?
But if you're 50 that might be that for 

769
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:00,560
you,
right?

770
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,393
You've hit zero,
you'd been out of the market for 18 

771
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,550
months,
nobody's gonna hire you.

772
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,893
And so you've hit zero.
And the problem is we don't know what 

773
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:10,700
the hell to do.
When people hit zero,

774
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,930
it's difficult to pry them out of zero 
and throw them back in the game.

775
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,760
Now you could say,
well,

776
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,960
what if you just rearm them with money?
And that would actually work if the game

777
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:21,794
was truly random.
But it isn't obvious that the game is 

778
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,620
truly random.
And that's where things get weird.

779
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,880
Okay.
So anyways,

780
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:29,714
by this point in the game,
there's some winners piling up and 

781
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:33,860
there's some losers planning up.
What,

782
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,850
what's the difference between the people
who have 19 and the people who have one?

783
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,560
Well,
we know the one people,

784
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,310
they're going to be wiped out.
They got a 50% chance,

785
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,480
a hidden zero.
What about the 19 people?

786
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Uh,
uh,

787
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,291
right,
exactly.

788
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,720
So they're in this place where the 
basically sitting pretty,

789
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,703
they can fail nine times and that just 
puts them back to where they were to 

790
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,970
begin with.
So,

791
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:02,380
okay.
So we keep playing

792
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,680
well.
So you see what's happening is that with

793
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:34,514
repeated random play,
the normal distribution turns into a 

794
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:42,470
[inaudible] distribution and most of the
population stacks up at zero.

795
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Hmm,
okay.

796
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,490
This old guy I told you about,

797
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,670
he had a theory of social structure that
was predicated on this.

798
00:43:56,671 --> 00:43:59,640
There's a bit of a Marxist twist to it.
He thought that what happened is that,

799
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:00,923
so if you ran a game long enough,
most people will stack up at zero and a 

800
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,910
few people have everything.
Okay,

801
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:10,110
so let's say now you're down at zero.
What's your best strategy?

802
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,540
Well,
you might say,

803
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,010
well,
we should reset the game,

804
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,083
right?
Because if you're at zero and it's 

805
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:17,964
basically a random game,
if you wipe out that game and you put a 

806
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:21,564
note in another one in place,
there's some probability that when the 

807
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:26,400
next game starts playing,
you're not going to end up at zero.

808
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,160
And that was his theory of revolutions.
Fundamentally,

809
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,790
once the,
once the game played itself out in until

810
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,710
resources,
we're maximally distributed.

811
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,753
It didn't cost the people at the bottom 
anything to be revolutionaries because 

812
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:41,154
they aren't already hit zero.
And so one of his hypothesis was that 

813
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,673
one of the things that
political and economic systems have to 

814
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:52,020
do,
they have to figure out how to do,

815
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:52,854
is to make sure that the people who end 
up on the zero side of the distribution 

816
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,450
don't have nothing to lose.
Because if you have nothing to lose,

817
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,640
God only knows what you're going to do 
next.

818
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,970
Now it's a big problem because merely 
shoveling money down there is not likely

819
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,290
to change the outcome very much.
Yes.

820
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,740
Yes.

821
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,690
I was to say that sounds a little bit 
like the policy though.

822
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,063
Like if you just,
once you've reset beginning your 

823
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,040
probability of ending up happens first 
time.

824
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,430
Yeah.
But the p the probability that any given

825
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:28,264
person will end up at zero is the same.
But the probability that you'll end up 

826
00:45:32,411 --> 00:45:33,280
the same isn't it?

827
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,113
Cause at the beginning of the game and 
you have just as much probability of 

828
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:40,580
moving up to the top as you do a moving 
down to the bottom.

829
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,370
Once you write zero though,
you don't get to play anymore.

830
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,820
So at zero your probability of moving up
is zero.

831
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,523
Whereas at the beginning,
your probability of moving up is 50% so 

832
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:53,654
when the gambler's fallacy is merely 
that if you keep dumping good money 

833
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:58,160
after bad,
you'll win it back.

834
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,023
You know,
because let's say you've lost 10 times 

835
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:01,280
in a row and you think,
well,

836
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,233
I've lost 10 times in a row,
it's 50 50 I must have a virtually a 

837
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:06,920
hundred percent chance of winning the 
next time.

838
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:07,431
It's like,
well,

839
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,890
no you don't because probability doesn't
have any memory.

840
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,850
That's the gambler's fallacy.
So all right.

841
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,850
Now,
one of the things we might ask ourselves

842
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,713
is this is something that I,
that I discussed with him and lake 

843
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:25,340
because he really thought of this as a 
random process and you know,

844
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:27,170
because he,
he thought here it's very,

845
00:46:27,171 --> 00:46:28,640
very interesting and very complicated.

846
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,170
It's like we know,
for example,

847
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:33,170
that the Iq distribution in this room is
approximately normal.

848
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,160
And so we can assume that it's a 
consequence of random factors.

849
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,141
Okay,
so what,

850
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:40,550
what do we mean random factors?
Well,

851
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,553
there'd being random genetic things 
going on in your lineage since life 

852
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,750
began.
And here you are.

853
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:49,520
You know,
you're smarter than him.

854
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,260
Perhaps.
Why?

855
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,393
Well,
we're going to eliminate the 

856
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,820
environmental effects for now.
Just forget about them.

857
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,030
We're going to assume that everybody's 
been raised in an environment where they

858
00:46:59,031 --> 00:47:02,450
had enough to eat and where they have 
enough resources,

859
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:03,843
um,
informational resources so that their 

860
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,314
intellect can capitalize.
So none of you people have been starved 

861
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,284
for information or food.
So I would say in many ways the 

862
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:13,910
important variation in the environment 
is already be.

863
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,190
Now your note for most of,
not completely.

864
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,533
Okay.
So it's random occurrences in the past 

865
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:23,750
and the evolutionary history that's put 
you wherever the hell you are and the Iq

866
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:24,584
distribution.

867
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,620
So you're the beneficiary of random 
forces.

868
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,690
So he thought of the problem is being 
random all the way down to the bottom.

869
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,410
Now the problem I have with that is wait
a second,

870
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,513
we have evidence that some things 
predict where you're going to end up in 

871
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:42,970
the distribution.
And so what are those things?

872
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,040
Well,
Iq,

873
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,610
conscientiousness,
emotional stability,

874
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,850
openness.
If it's a creative product.

875
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,803
And then some other smattering of 
personality features depending on the 

876
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:57,430
particular domain.
So for example,

877
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,090
if you want to be a salesperson,
some extroversion is huge,

878
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,500
is useful.
If you want to be a manager,

879
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,423
it tends to be better if you're 
disagreeable to some degree rather than 

880
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:06,784
if you're agreeable.
If you want to be a nurse or a 

881
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,550
caretaker,
then agreeableness is useful.

882
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,580
But the big performance predictors 
across time,

883
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:17,581
our intelligence and conscientiousness.
Now if the damn game is random,

884
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,403
which the statistics seem to indicate,
or at least that you can model it using 

885
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,543
processes that model random processes.
Why in the world do Iq and 

886
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:30,010
conscientiousness,
we'll just stick with those two for now.

887
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,710
Why in the world do they predict 
success?

888
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,110
So does anybody have any ideas about 
that?

889
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,030
Let's start with Iq.

890
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,393
Mean for example,
if you apply your Iq to the stock 

891
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:45,694
market,
if I distribute do you all a bunch of 

892
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,360
money and I,
and I mentioned your Iq and I said,

893
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:52,060
okay,
put together a portfolio.

894
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,690
You get to pick 30 stocks,
you can't sell them for a year.

895
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,340
You get to sell them at the end of the 
year.

896
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,563
Um,
what's the probability that the high Iq 

897
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,980
people would pick a better set of stocks
than the low Iq?

898
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,190
People
answer that as far as I can tell,

899
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,033
is zero.

900
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,970
It's not.
It's not going to because you can't pick

901
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:12,740
stocks.
As it turns out,

902
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,960
all the information has already eaten 
up.

903
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,231
So I,
and,

904
00:49:16,231 --> 00:49:19,040
and the stock market's an interesting 
analogy of the environment,

905
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:19,910
right?
Do you know what I mean?

906
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:20,744
Because the stock market is basically an
index of continually transforming human 

907
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,050
economic and social environment.
It's basically random.

908
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,630
You can't predict the damn thing,
even if you're smart.

909
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,410
So why is it that smart people when 
across time,

910
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,490
and then again,
why is it that hard working people cross

911
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:37,324
time?
It'd be imagined each peg on the golden 

912
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,370
or as like a choice point in life.
Then if people with a higher ed,

913
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,370
you are more likely to choose the choice
point that will be done,

914
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,111
you know?
No,

915
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:49,630
but that's only a restatement of what I 
just said.

916
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,440
It's not a causal account.
You're basically saying that the high Iq

917
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:55,030
people make better choices.

918
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,013
Yeah.
But that's,

919
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,420
if it's a random environment,
how can they,

920
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,633
I'm thinking instead of money,
we can view it as opportunities and 

921
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:04,534
genetics,
which make somebody adoptable multiple 

922
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:11,671
environments and each coin flip as each 
subsequent generation of that lineage.

923
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,120
So that there is an increase.
Like the more adoptable genetics,

924
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,870
emotional stability and situational 
wealth you have,

925
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,460
the more likely your next generation has
it.

926
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,310
You know,
like they have to lose a lot more to get

927
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,540
them to zero.
Okay.

928
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:33,470
So what about a given individual though?
Forget about some being,

929
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:35,120
forget about it.
Planning across time.

930
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,500
And that's also a weird thing because 
some of the single celled organisms that

931
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,960
you,
that were your ancestors 3 billion years

932
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:46,310
ago are still single celled organisms.
Whereas here you are,

933
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,271
you know,
you know,

934
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:48,950
same environment,
roughly speaking.

935
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:52,520
So there's this tremendous branching of 
possibility across time.

936
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,470
And you might say,
well Iq is adaptive,

937
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,760
which is a terrible word.

938
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,050
Adaptive.
It's like,

939
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:57,501
yeah,
okay,

940
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,780
so how do you account for all the single
celled organisms?

941
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,000
They're just not that bright.
But there they are.

942
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,133
There's broad,
there's more of them by weight than 

943
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:04,964
there are of us people by weight.
So I probably think this out a bunch of 

944
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:09,674
different ways and you can,
you can think about this and see what 

945
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:11,864
you think.
I mean the first thing that seems to be 

946
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,860
to be the cases that you don't have to 
play one game,

947
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:17,983
you know,
like imagine that you're sitting around 

948
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:19,634
with your friends and there were 50 
board games going on and you can keep a 

949
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:25,070
hand in,
in each of them.

950
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,270
Well then at some point in one of the 
board games,

951
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,400
you're going to start to amass some 
success,

952
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,630
right?
Just by chance.

953
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,490
And if you're playing 50 board games in 
25 of them after playing for some time,

954
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:38,570
you're going to be at the top of it.

955
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,643
You know when you're going to be moving 
towards the top 50% rather than the 

956
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,610
Bordeaux,
we might say,

957
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,570
okay,
play 50 games played 20 turns.

958
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,910
Throw away the ones that you're doing 
the worst yet,

959
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,223
the 5% that you're doing the worst yet.
And then just keep doing that until you 

960
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:55,334
end up with the one game that you win.
And maybe you can do that better if you 

961
00:51:58,341 --> 00:52:02,340
have high Iq cause you're faster.
So maybe you all you can.

962
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,260
All that happens is that if you're smart
is that you can play many games faster.

963
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,770
And as a consequence of that,
you can choose the ones that you seem to

964
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:10,604
be winning and stick with those.
And then maybe what happens with 

965
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:16,250
conscientiousness is that you actually 
stick to them.

966
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,570
So that means that you actually don't 
have to predict the future.

967
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:22,404
In order to master it.
It means that you have to simulate 

968
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:26,970
multiple futures,
keep your options open,

969
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,940
and sort of play dynamically as the 
environment unfolds.

970
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,753
So now it might be more complicated than
that because it's also possible that in 

971
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,520
some environments,
at least for local periods of time,

972
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:44,700
the,
the game is actually not random.

973
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,470
You know?
So it's,

974
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,313
it's funny like if,
do you think money is the monopoly 

975
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:50,634
random?

976
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,573
What do you think?
You've all who everybody hears played 

977
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:55,800
monopoly,
I presume,

978
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,090
right?
Is there anybody who hasn't?

979
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,480
Okay.
So what,

980
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,313
what do you think?
Did the smart people win monopoly more 

981
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:01,434
often?

982
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,290
I think it's the people that

983
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,683
you do you think so you would say it's 
the conscientious people that win more 

984
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:08,520
often

985
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,730
what each move too?

986
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,240
Yeah.
Well it's pretty clear that you can,

987
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,330
you can lose stupidly in monopoly,
right?

988
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,520
Although I'm not sure if you can win 
intelligently,

989
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,330
you know,
you can avoid obviously bad choices.

990
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:25,140
Like one choice would be don't buy any 
property and just hold onto your money.

991
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,750
That seems to be a losing strategy.
Right?

992
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,840
So that'll wipe me out.
So maybe another thing that smart people

993
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,320
can do is that they don't do things that
are self evidently.

994
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,330
Okay.

995
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,680
That,
that make it certain that you will lose.

996
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,530
It might be something like that.
So,

997
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,593
all right.
So one of the things we might ask 

998
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:48,901
ourselves too is given that Iq and and 
conscientiousness do predict success,

999
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:54,040
how much success do they predict across 
talk?

1000
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:59,490
And the answer to that is
they predict a substantial amount.

1001
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,580
If you combine our Iq and personality,
I'll show you the equations.

1002
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:12,071
These were formulated in the 1990s.
So we're going to look at this here.

1003
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:14,264
So,
um,

1004
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,430
let me walk you through it a bit.

1005
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,900
Okay,

1006
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,420
so this is a spreadsheet I put together 
quite a long time ago.

1007
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:25,700
It's a little bigger so you can see it.

1008
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:34,150
So here's what,
here's the elements of the,

1009
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,930
of the equation.
So you need to know,

1010
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,243
Ooh,

1011
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,500
first element in equation,
how many people?

1012
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:47,311
So we're going to say,
well,

1013
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,144
how powerfully can you predict the 
performance outcome of people across 

1014
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:51,864
time?
And were they the value we're going to 

1015
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,690
use his dollar value and dollars are 
basically,

1016
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,093
they're sort of like a,
they're obviously they're the universal 

1017
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,380
currency because you can trade money in 
for virtually anything.

1018
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:06,720
So we use dollars as their standard of 
value.

1019
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,900
Um,
the first question might be,

1020
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:10,734
well,
how many people do you want to predict 

1021
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:13,410
for?
So let's say we're going to take 10.

1022
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,390
So He'd,
we put that in this part of the equation

1023
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,650
here,
10 people.

1024
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,240
Then you might say,
well,

1025
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,890
over what period of time do you want to 
calculate their success?

1026
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:23,724
And one decent answer is five years 
because people seem to stay in the same 

1027
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,100
job position or career position for 
about five years,

1028
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:34,620
although that shortening,
okay,

1029
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:36,750
so that's another thing that you guys 
should keep in mind.

1030
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,603
You probably not going to be in the same
position in your life for more than 

1031
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:40,824
about five years at a time.
And so you have to plan and plot for 

1032
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,910
dynamic transformations in your career 
and you have to do that in a way that,

1033
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,750
um,
that,

1034
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,673
that works to your advantage,
which partly means you have to keep 

1035
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:57,450
options open and you have to be able to 
say no.

1036
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,550
So,
okay,

1037
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:01,980
the next thing you might ask yourself 
is,

1038
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,510
well,
how high a predictor,

1039
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:06,240
what's the Roi for your predictor of 
what's the correlation coefficient?

1040
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:08,970
And we put together a neuropsychological
battery.

1041
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,040
Um,
I published the results of this with,

1042
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:11,874
uh,
with uh,

1043
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:12,903
with,
uh,

1044
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,050
someone named Dan Daniel Higgins quite a
long time ago.

1045
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,063
We used neuropsychological battery 
looking at dorsal lateral prefrontal 

1046
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:20,994
ability,
which we thought of as something 

1047
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:22,974
potentially from fluid intelligence,
which problem but which probably just 

1048
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:29,200
turned out to be quite a good measure of
fluid intelligence.

1049
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,303
And we also used conscientiousness and 
we found that when we validated that in 

1050
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,624
a,
we validated it in a factory and we 

1051
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:38,884
looked at the performance of the 
administrators and managers in the 

1052
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:42,214
factory because they had relatively 
complex jobs and we had access to seven 

1053
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:46,324
years of their performance records,
which someone else had gathered 

1054
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:49,174
independently of us.
And what we found was that for those 

1055
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,320
people who had performance records that 
were more than four years old,

1056
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,363
we could predict their performance at 
about 0.59 about about 0.6 tremendously 

1057
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:03,964
powerful prediction.
Now one of the things we found was that 

1058
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,443
the degree to which our predictions were
accurate increased with the increase in 

1059
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,420
the number of years of performance data 
we have.

1060
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,441
So,
for example,

1061
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:18,390
if I want to predict how you do next 
year and then I'd get a performance it,

1062
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,230
you enter a new job and I get a 
performance index after your first year,

1063
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,123
I'm not going to be able to predict out 
very well from your intelligence and 

1064
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:27,244
your conscientiousness because the 
measure of your performance actually 

1065
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:30,874
won't be very good because it turns out 
that you can't even figure out how well 

1066
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:37,600
someone is performing in a job until 
about three years.

1067
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,810
So it turns out that if you take a 
complex job on,

1068
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,243
you get better and better at it over 
three years if you're going to get 

1069
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,274
better and better at it.
And so we can't tell how well you're 

1070
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:49,600
doing until about that period of time.
So that's another thing that's useful to

1071
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:50,770
know.
By the way,

1072
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,430
when you guys go off to find your next 
complex role in life,

1073
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,563
you can't really expect to be good at 
what you're going to do until about 

1074
00:57:58,151 --> 00:58:00,520
three years.
After about four years,

1075
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,100
additional experience doesn't seem to 
matter.

1076
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,593
So that's also worth knowing.
So you're going to feel like a bloody 

1077
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:09,880
moron for the first bit of your new job.
And that's because you are,

1078
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:11,530
but you,
you,

1079
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:13,570
if you keep at it,
you'll accrue,

1080
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,610
um,
experience and,

1081
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,820
and,
and expertise quite rapidly over a three

1082
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:19,654
year period.
And that's probably the right amount of 

1083
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:22,384
time over which to evaluate your 
performance because you need to know 

1084
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:25,720
that,
right?

1085
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,110
Should you be freaking out if after six 
months you're not doing a good job,

1086
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,680
well you got to see how you're doing 
compared to your peers.

1087
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,650
Hopefully you're not doing a worse job 
than them,

1088
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:36,484
but if it's a complex job,
it's going to take you a long time to 

1089
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:39,820
master it.
So,

1090
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:40,780
okay,
so anyways,

1091
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:41,614
our predictor was 0.59,
which we are pretty damn thrilled about 

1092
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:45,723
and we are comparing that.
We're going to compare that to a 

1093
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,150
comparison predictor of zero.
For now zero is random.

1094
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,510
So if I was going to predict your 
trajectory through life,

1095
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:57,820
let's say I want to predict your 
industrial productivity.

1096
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,890
I'll take 10 of you.
I'm going to,

1097
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,940
I'm going to predict your industrial 
productivity over the next five years.

1098
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,290
That's,
that'll be the goal.

1099
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,710
Um,
or we can do this.

1100
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,630
I will do this a slightly different way.
Um,

1101
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,110
let's see.

1102
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,080
So that's the selection ratio.
The last one is the selection ratio.

1103
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,210
So let's say,
um,

1104
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,530
I wanted to select you guys for a 
position at a,

1105
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,370
uh,
let's say you're going to be managers in

1106
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:23,450
a,
in a,

1107
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,440
in a relatively complex corporate 
organization,

1108
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:31,610
there's about 110 of you or something 
like that in here.

1109
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:35,210
Now maybe let's say a hundred.
Say I'm going to pick 10 of you.

1110
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,470
That means my selection ratio is right 
there.

1111
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,760
It's one,
it's,

1112
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,800
it's one in 10 that you can transform 
that into a standard score of 1.76.

1113
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,233
Now,
it's important to know how many people 

1114
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:49,664
you get to choose from.
Because if you're going to hire one 

1115
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,054
person and you only have one applicant,
there's not a lot of sense doing any 

1116
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:58,280
selection because you only have one 
applicant.

1117
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:00,310
So I don't care how much you knew about 
that person.

1118
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:02,090
It's not going to be helpful if you have
to hire them.

1119
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,283
But in this situation,
we're going to assume that I can screen 

1120
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,170
all 100 of you and only recommend 10.
Okay?

1121
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:14,770
So we're going to assume you have to put
in a variable for job complexity because

1122
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,513
the relationship between intelligence 
and conscientiousness increases the 

1123
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:20,564
relationship between intelligence,
conscientiousness and predictive power 

1124
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:25,760
increases.
As the job becomes more complicated,

1125
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,830
she's is exactly what you'd expect,
right?

1126
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:32,150
So if you can do a job by wrote,
all that Iq would conscientiousness will

1127
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:36,560
predict is how fast you can learn it.
But if it's a dynamic job where you have

1128
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:38,810
to make decisions not on a nonstop 
basis,

1129
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:39,913
then Iq and conscientiousness are going 
to predict your performance over the 

1130
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,244
long run.
So we're going to assume that you're in 

1131
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:45,434
a complex job.
We're gonna assume that you have an 

1132
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:52,061
annual salary of $75,000 so then the 
question is armed with that knowledge,

1133
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,733
how much money would the company that's 
using my products obtain by using the 

1134
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:05,390
selection compared to with,
if they just picked 10 of you randomly,

1135
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,780
and the answer is right there
in five years

1136
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:18,050
they would have made $4 million more 
than they would've if they would've just

1137
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:18,884
picked randomly.
And that would be a productivity 

1138
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,700
increase of 104%

1139
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,200
so there,
that's graft here.

1140
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,273
So with random selection,
50% of the people you hire are going to 

1141
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:39,570
be above average and 50% are going to be
below.

1142
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,763
And using a good psychometric battery,
you can get that to vote 80 20 and the 

1143
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:50,121
consequence of that is
$4 million in increased productivity.

1144
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,590
So now we're going to turn that into one
person.

1145
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,430
So over five years,
if you selection processes properly,

1146
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,410
you make $400,000 more by hiring one 
better person,

1147
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,130
it's $40,000 it's what is that to 
$100,000 a year?

1148
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,410
It's actually more than you're paying 
them in salary.

1149
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,130
And now the reason for that,
there's a bunch of reasons.

1150
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,080
The first reason is,
is that there are tremendous amounts.

1151
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,350
There's tremendous differences in 
individual productivity.

1152
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,393
Now,
one of the things that's weird about 

1153
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:31,830
these formulas is this formula is 
predicated on the idea that productivity

1154
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,903
is actually normally distributed,
but actually productivity is prieto 

1155
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,703
distributed.
So what that means is that the basic 

1156
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,704
consequence of using this sort of 
prediction is probably higher than this 

1157
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:46,290
formula indicates.

1158
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:48,483
Now,

1159
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,010
there's a variety of reasons to know.
This.

1160
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:04,844
One is obviously the practical idea.
The practical idea is of what use is it 

1161
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:10,484
knowing something about the people that 
you're going to hire and that's or work 

1162
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:14,624
with?
And the answer to that is it depends on 

1163
01:03:15,561 --> 01:03:16,394
what you know.
But if the things that you know are 

1164
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:22,880
valid and they include personality and 
intelligence,

1165
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,660
it's not only valuable to know it,
it's virtually vital because the success

1166
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:34,220
of your enterprise will depend on the 
people that you hire an associate with.

1167
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:40,040
The second thing is I think that knowing
this should change the way that you look

1168
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:40,874
at the world.

1169
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,053
If you understand that the outcomes in 
life are distributed on a prieto 

1170
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:48,944
distribution and that there are in belt 
temperamental factors that play an 

1171
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:58,190
important role in determining that one 
of the problems that you have before you

1172
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:01,280
as modern people is what the hell do you
do about that?

1173
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,900
From a conceptual,
social,

1174
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:03,734
political and economic perspective?
Because nobody who's currently 

1175
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,673
considering how societies are structured
pays any attention to this sort of 

1176
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:14,174
thing.
They don't assume that there are 

1177
01:04:15,531 --> 01:04:18,830
differences between people with regards 
to their life outcome chances,

1178
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:19,723
not of this sort of magnitude.
And so none of the social policies that 

1179
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:24,074
we have in place reflect any of this.
And so I would say like our 

1180
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:28,904
psychometrics are 21st century in our 
political and economic theories are 

1181
01:04:31,941 --> 01:04:32,774
basically 17th century and it's not a 
good thing and you guys are going to 

1182
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:37,034
suffer for this or benefit from it 
because as society becomes more 

1183
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:44,390
technological and as it transforms more 
and more rapidly,

1184
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:45,523
the degree to which the prieto 
distribution is going to kick in is 

1185
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,310
going to increase.

1186
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,353
Now you already see that.
That's why that the separation between 

1187
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:56,174
rich and poor in industrialized 
countries is becoming increasingly 

1188
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,880
severe.
Now,

1189
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:02,923
that's modified by some degree to the 
fat by the fact that the middle class 

1190
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:10,760
worldwide is growing like mad.
And so that's a really good thing.

1191
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,300
But still the longterm plays the prieto 
distribution,

1192
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:18,520
and it's partly because an person is one
thing,

1193
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,990
but an intelligent person with infinite 
computational power.

1194
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,090
That's a completely different thing,
and that's where we're headed.

1195
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,230
So I don't know exactly what to make of 
all this sort of thing politically,

1196
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:32,140
but I know that to the degree that we 
ignore it,

1197
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,040
we're going to have very unhappy and and
unstable societies.

1198
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,150
So we'll see you Thursday on that happy 
note.

1199
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,250
Let's see you Thursday.
