1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,960
Okay,
running.

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,283
All right,
so,

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,663
so let's talk about your brain.
So there's lots of different ways of 

4
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:26,580
dividing up the brain and believe me,
people are still arguing about how to do

5
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,870
that.
So,

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,490
um,
I don't remember if I

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,570
signed the Swanson paper to you as a 
reading.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,610
Do you,
do any of you remember that?

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,500
Yes,
it's there.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,210
It's very hard paper.
Very,

11
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,080
very,
very hard.

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,230
What I want you to do is to familiarize 
yourself with it.

13
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:46,064
I mean it,
someone's whole life work and he's 

14
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:52,451
really smart so you're just not going to
be able to digest the entire paper,

15
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:53,444
but it's a brilliant paper and Swanson 
is a developmental neuro added an 

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,153
anatomist and he basically envisions the
brain using a conceptual schema that's 

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,890
based on how it transforms itself.
I think I turned it on across time.

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,093
So,
and what I really love about Swanson is 

19
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,390
that he builds the brain from the bottom
up,

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,400
from the body upwards.
Okay?

21
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,234
So,
and that's incredibly useful because 

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,683
there's a real dualism that still 
saturates almost all of the conceptions 

23
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:29,330
that you hear about the brain in most 
areas in psychology,

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,033
certainly being one of those,
we kind of treat the brain as if it's 

25
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,560
the place of the mind and the mind to 
something separate from the body,

26
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,394
and you could just sort of take your 
brain out of your body and you'd still 

27
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,380
have a mind and it's like no wrong.

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,423
One of the things the ai people 
discovered after many decades of trying 

29
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:50,270
to make things intelligent was that 
until they put them in a body,

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,433
things weren't intelligent.
So intelligent seems integrally linked 

31
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:59,891
to the ability to maneuver yourself 
through space in a physically embodied,

32
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,390
limited forum and to manipulate the 
world.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,640
So,
so your body is.

34
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:08,510
Your brain is first of all,
your brain isn't in your head anyways.

35
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,344
It's distributed throughout your body.
All you have to do is look at the 

36
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,010
nervous system to figure that out.
Second,

37
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:13,844
there's more neurons in your autonomic 
nervous system than there are in your 

38
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,870
central nervous system.
I mean,

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,690
you know,
your brain is not only in your head,

40
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,520
it's a really foolish way of thinking 
about it,

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,640
so all right.
Having said that,

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,893
there are multiple ways of 
conceptualizing the brain and a lot of 

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,793
whether or not the conceptual structure 
is accurate is whether or not it's 

44
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,094
useful,
so I'm going to go through a couple 

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,410
because they are useful in different 
ways.

46
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,410
This is one that's basically based on 
the model that Russian neuropsychologist

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,040
produced,
led by Luria,

48
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,903
who was the greatest Russian 
neuropsychologist and who had amazing 

49
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:47,654
students and many of them laid down the 
groundwork for the models that we're 

50
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,290
going to describe and they were heavily 
influenced by cybernetic thinking by the

51
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,200
way.
So the,

52
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,710
the two fields played like this over 
from the 19 twenties till now.

53
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,110
Really so.
So from the,

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,093
from the Lurie and perspective,
your brain is basically something that 

55
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,550
acts.
It's acts in the world and perceives the

56
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,530
world,
and the back half of the brain,

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,543
roughly speaking,
is for perceiving and the front half is 

58
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,580
for acting.
Now here's something to think about.

59
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,414
You know,
I'm sure you've been taught the 

60
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,680
prefrontal cortex is the seat of 
abstract thought.

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,440
You know the seat of executive decision 
making,

62
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,274
for example.
It's like I'm not so convinced about 

63
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,664
that theory for a variety of reasons,
but one of the things that's that is 

64
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,200
true about the prefrontal cortex is that
during the course of evolution,

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,280
it grew out of the motor cortex,
so if you look at this representation,

66
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,110
the top one there is the primary zone,
which is the motor strip,

67
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:47,944
and then the secondary zone,
which is the premotor strip and the 

68
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,360
tertiary zone,
which is the prefrontal Cortex,

69
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,194
and basically what happened was that 
first animals learn how to act and then 

70
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:00,520
they learned how to represent actions 
before they implemented them.

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,593
So the purpose of thinking is to 
represent actions before you implement 

72
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,580
them,
but it's not only auctions because there

73
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,890
aren't only actions,
right?

74
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724
Because to act,
you also have to perceive and so really 

75
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,574
what the prefrontal cortex does is run 
simulations of how a personality might 

76
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,824
operate and embodied personality might 
operate in a fictional world and that's 

77
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:22,684
what you're doing when you're thinking 
it's also what you're doing when you're 

78
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,730
watching movies or reading fiction or 
any of those sorts of things,

79
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,564
right?
Instead of having to act something out 

80
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,460
and potentially dying as a consequence 
of it,

81
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,563
you can watch something being simulated 
and see what happens and then if the 

82
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,724
outcome is good,
you can implement it and if the outcome 

83
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,760
isn't good,
then you can let it die.

84
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,970
And so I think it was Alfred North 
Whitehead that said,

85
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,850
um,
the purpose of thought is so that we can

86
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,180
let our hypotheses die instead of us.

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,210
That's smart.
That's a very smart thing.

88
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,044
And so what,
what's happened in some senses that 

89
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,270
human beings have gone from evolution to
mete evolution,

90
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,980
right?
Instead of evolving,

91
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,680
we can model evolution and then 
implement.

92
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,230
The idea is the personality,
so to speak,

93
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,840
that we think are most functional.
And we let the,

94
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,883
we let our fantasy do the selection 
instead of the actual world and it's a 

95
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,650
brilliant solution,
so brilliant solution.

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,783
So in some sense the sensory unit,
which is the back half of the brain is 

97
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,560
setting up your frameworks of perception
and integrating them.

98
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,394
And then the front half is determining 
how to sequence activities and modes of 

99
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,190
perception in order to act successfully 
in the world.

100
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,680
Right?
And so there's the actual implementation

101
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,620
of the auction and then there's the 
modeling of the implementation,

102
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,130
which is what gives rise to thinking.
And I,

103
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,013
I do think that it's very useful to 
think of thinking as a simulated 

104
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,290
personality.

105
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,123
Fundamentally you're running avatars of 
yourself in some sense in your 

106
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,550
imagination and trying to determine ones
are going to be successful.

107
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,160
Now you may have noticed,
given that I used the word Avatar,

108
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,490
that we've also now figured out who 
acts,

109
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,663
how to externalize the process of 
fantasy back into the actual world so 

110
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,074
that we can run simulations in fantasy 
on machinery and we can play out 

111
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,670
potentials that way instead of only 
having to do it in our brain.

112
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,120
You know?
And it's,

113
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,930
that's very,
very smart,

114
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:21,764
that's,
that's extraordinarily smart and it's 

115
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,060
really going to change things.
God only knows for how.

116
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,330
So one of the things about Larry is 
model.

117
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,610
You see that there's primary,
secondary,

118
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,444
and tertiary zones.
The tertiary zones are zones of 

119
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,570
integration,
the primary zones or zones where,

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,600
especially in the sensory systems where 
each senses elaborated in its entirety,

121
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,020
resolution sense before it becomes 
integrated with the other senses.

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,853
And so the tertiary zones are actually 
areas of overlap between the sense 

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,610
between the census.
So for example,

124
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,603
when you,
when you read silently my experience of 

125
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,920
reading silently as I hear the words in 
my head,

126
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,530
so to speak,
while you might think,

127
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,280
well,
you know,

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,020
you look at a word and you hear it in 
your head,

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,090
how,
how in the world is that possible?

130
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,900
And the answer is your eyes are using 
your auditory system.

131
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,243
So there's overlap between the visual 
and the auditory system in the tertiary 

132
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,964
zones.
And so basically what you're doing is 

133
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,154
hearing with your eyes and you know,
your consciousness has this property of 

134
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,170
unification,
right?

135
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,620
It's sort of like a unified experience.
And Larry,

136
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,463
I believe that it was the tertiary zones
that gave rise to that phenomena of 

137
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,620
unified experience.
He's a very smart character.

138
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,053
So the point is,
is that the motor unit is basically 

139
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:42,614
utilize the part of us that does 
planning forward planning and forward 

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,810
thinking is utilized to layout simulated
personalities in the world.

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,700
That's a good way of thinking about it.
So,

142
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:53,534
okay,
so that's one kind of neurological 

143
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:55,604
model.

144
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,680
Now,
let's see.

145
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,740
You want to go to more of the neurology 
here first.

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,650
All right,
so if you look at the motor strip,

147
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,743
this is called a whole mount keyless.
And when wilder penfield was initially 

148
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,640
doing open like brain surgery on people 
with epilepsy,

149
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,474
you know,
you're generally conscious during brain 

150
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,484
surgery,
which is rather horrifying thing to 

151
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:24,440
contemplate because they don't want to 
cut out a part that you might need.

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,620
And so they poke around in there often 
with electrodes and you know,

153
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:30,100
you can report what's happening to you.
Um,

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,900
well,
what pennfield did was,

155
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,123
was do Electra Electra electrode mapping
of the manner in which your body was 

156
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:43,520
represented in the primary motor area 
that was responsible for,

157
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,730
for sequencing action.
And what he found was this,

158
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,620
now usually you don't see it like that 
because the way your body is laid out in

159
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:52,454
your brain,
it's sort of torn apart and stretched 

160
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,680
out over the strip.

161
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
And there's weird,
there's weird places where the parts 

162
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,990
come together.
So for example,

163
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,240
there's a motor court,
a motor Homunculus,

164
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,523
and there's a sensory homonculus.
And one of the weird characteristics of 

165
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,914
the sensory homonculus is that the 
genital region is right beside the 

166
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:14,040
region for the feet.
And one of the things that you can infer

167
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:14,874
from that is that's why people take such
delight in such things as foot massages 

168
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,530
and why feet fetishes,
for example,

169
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,740
are quite common because the areas do 
bleed into one another.

170
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,350
So that's pretty amusing.
So anyways,

171
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,970
there's the hmong canvas,
have you might say,

172
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:27,804
well,
that's how your brain thinks of your 

173
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,410
body in terms of what you can do with 
your body.

174
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,290
And so that's like a human being.
That's in fact,

175
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,270
that might be more what a human being is
like.

176
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,463
Then the human being used,
see when you just look at a human being 

177
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,110
and what you see is,
well,

178
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,980
we're pretty handy when we're pretty 
damn mouthy.

179
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,310
And so one of the ways you can think 
about that,

180
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,144
and I think it's right,
is that human beings running around 

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,753
taking things apart and putting them 
back together with their hands and then 

182
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,380
they talk about that all the time.
And,

183
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,760
and we have a tremendous amount of 
control over our tongue.

184
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,680
Now it's wired up right at birth by the 
way,

185
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,514
and lips as well.
So that's a primary investigative 

186
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,520
Oregon,
you know,

187
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,680
and it's used for multiple purposes.
So,

188
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,803
you know,
children really explore the world with 

189
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,854
their lips and tongue.
And of course it's a primary area for 

190
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,150
sexual exploration,
but it's also,

191
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,243
uh,
it's also the part of our body that we 

192
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,194
use to transform the things that we can 
do with our hands into patterns of 

193
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,024
communication so that we can speak about
what we do with our hands so that other 

194
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,420
people can learn how to do that with 
their hands.

195
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,253
And if you look at your hands,
what you'll see is you're mostly thumbs 

196
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,801
right in,
you know,

197
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:38,634
one of the things that you always learn 
from scientists is that it's an 

198
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,760
opposable thumb that makes us human.
And certainly the thumb,

199
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:49,410
especially on the right hand is like you
see you've got more motor cortex devoted

200
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:51,600
to your damn thumb than you do to your 
whole body.

201
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,950
And that's because,
well,

202
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,080
I tried picking up a ranch with your 
back.

203
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,390
You know,
you're just not going to get very far.

204
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,224
And so it's really useful to think about
the brain body in this hunkeler killer 

205
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,034
fashion because it also helps you 
understand other things because you'll 

206
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,810
hear people say,
well,

207
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:07,644
dolphins are super human in their 
intelligence because they're in 

208
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,810
centralization.
Quotient is higher than ours,

209
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:13,644
and the encephalization quotient is the 
ratio of brain tissue to the race to 

210
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,180
bodyweight.

211
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,520
Fundamentally brain weight to body 
weight.

212
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,900
Yeah,
yeah.

213
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,003
That's a measure of intelligence.
But the thing is is that imagine adults 

214
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,294
in homonculus.
It's like what the hell are they going 

215
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:29,884
to do with all that intelligence?
Like nose up some dirt on the bottom of 

216
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,620
the ocean.
That's about it.

217
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,783
They can't build anything.
They can't take things apart and put 

218
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,814
them back together.
And so whatever their brain is being 

219
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:41,724
used for,
it has very little relationship to what 

220
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,054
our brain is being used for.
Our bodies are articulated where Adolfo 

221
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,980
does sort of like a test tube,
you know,

222
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,920
and they can swim like mad and they're 
obviously extremely playful,

223
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,330
which is one of the attributes of 
intelligent creatures,

224
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,340
but they're not taking things apart and 
putting them back together like we are.

225
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,110
And that's what we're doing all the 
time.

226
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,950
We do that with our speech is in fact 
the,

227
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,790
the essence of taking things apart and 
putting them back together.

228
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,840
You know,
and the hypothesis are with,

229
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,370
with regards to speech development that 
we.

230
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,750
We developed our capacity for 
articulated movement before we developed

231
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:23,950
our capacity for language and that the 
only reason we ever developed a capacity

232
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,784
for language was because it sort of 
developed as a secondary consequence of 

233
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,570
our developed ability to produce 
articulated action.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,330
Now the two things probably spiraled 
across time,

235
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,310
so I don't think you can.
You know,

236
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:39,130
it's not a chicken came first and then 
the egg issue,

237
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,390
it's that chickens have eggs and eggs 
have chickens and that just keeps going.

238
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,810
But the point is is that our ability to 
represent things in an articulate manner

239
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,350
is directly related to our ability to 
use our joints in an articulated manner.

240
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,100
And so that's what we're like in the 
world.

241
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,610
We're out there doing things to it and 
then talking about it,

242
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,220
we're very handy and we're very mouthy.

243
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,563
So that's useful to know because that's 
sort of how the brain pictures of the 

244
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:13,531
body and the fact that the brain 
pictures of the body that way means that

245
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,760
that's how the brain conceptualizes the 
body as an entity for use in,

246
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,210
in,
in the environment.

247
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,291
And so you say,
well,

248
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,690
how do human beings adapt?
Well,

249
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,543
we run around taking things apart and 
putting them back together with her 

250
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,460
hands and talking about it and we're 
very good at that.

251
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,810
And so you could say,
well,

252
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,620
in some sense that's our primary.
I think that that's.

253
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,590
It's a reflect.
No,

254
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,753
it's a reflection of the same processes 
that gave rise to the idea of the hero 

255
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,230
because there's two ways of adapting to 
the world in some sense.

256
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,320
One way is just to do what everyone else
has done.

257
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,290
That's always worked.
All animals do that.

258
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,970
That's what they do.

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,340
Like bears now and bears a thousand 
years ago.

260
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,370
It's like they're the same bear even 
though they're very complicated.

261
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,660
Same with chimps.
You know,

262
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,090
people say chimps have culture and can 
make tools.

263
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:05,380
It's like,
that's wrong,

264
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,723
and here's why it's wrong.
If a chimp could increase its domain of 

265
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:15,490
cultural expertise by a 10th of a 
percent,

266
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,710
a generation,
which is like nothing,

267
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,460
well run that for 7 million years at 
compound interest and what happens?

268
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,920
Well,
you get drawn to,

269
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,303
right?
I mean I don't know how much we 

270
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:31,450
transform our culture with each 
generation,

271
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,703
but doesn't have to be very damn much 
for there to be cities after 2 million 

272
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,030
years of iteration.
Well,

273
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,400
chimps are still living in the jungle 
now.

274
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,234
They do use tools,
but what seems to happen is that the 

275
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:43,654
environment,
and they do use different tools in 

276
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,144
different locales,
but what seems to happen is that the 

277
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:48,964
environment suggests the tools to them 
so they have a certain level of 

278
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:57,560
intelligence and they can figure out how
to use what's at hand and what's at hand

279
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,940
is different in different places.

280
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,773
So they use different tools,
but that doesn't mean they're thinking 

281
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,354
up different tools.
They're not clearly because there's no 

282
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,190
accumulation.
There's no accumulation of culture.

283
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,024
So I don't see how you can escape from 
that mathematical argument and you can 

284
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,030
make the same argument to pretty much 
any other creature.

285
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,643
Even ants,
it's like they're making the same damn 

286
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,410
ant hills they were making or God only 
knows how long ago.

287
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,210
I mean they're very successful at it,
but there's,

288
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,433
there's no innovation and so being the 
same as the things that live before you 

289
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,114
that lived is a pretty good strategy,
but that isn't the human strategy or 

290
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:33,554
it's actually half the human strategy 
because half our strategy is to do what 

291
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:43,241
everyone else has always done and the 
other half is to fix that where it's not

292
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,350
working very well or at least to try to 
fix it.

293
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,183
And I think this is an excellent 
representation of the abilities we have 

294
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,124
embodied to do precisely that.
So here's another way of thinking about 

295
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:57,794
the brain.
This is mostly partly from Laurie again 

296
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:00,764
and the Russians.
This is from one of his students whose 

297
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,010
name is [inaudible],
Conan Goldberg,

298
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,650
who's a practicing neuroscientist to New
York.

299
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:10,250
And I think he's a very bright guy.
And I like his theory because you know,

300
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,084
you've heard classic theories about 
linguistic versus non linguistic 

301
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,324
hemisphere.
So the the left hemisphere usually is 

302
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,264
regarded as the linguistic hemisphere 
because in right-handed males in 

303
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,404
particular,
language tends to be pretty located in 

304
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,370
the left hemisphere.
Now,

305
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,473
what I would say instead of that is that
there are linguistic and non linguistic 

306
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,034
systems in the brain and most of the 
time they segregate out so that the 

307
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,860
linguistic system is in the left 
hemisphere and the non linguistic system

308
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,070
is in the right hemisphere,
but it doesn't have to happen that way.

309
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,340
It can be reversed with people who are 
left handed.

310
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,503
It's more distributed in women,
and if you lose your whole right 

311
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,344
hemisphere when you're like 18 months 
old so you don't even have a right 

312
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,734
hemisphere,
your left hemisphere will specialize so 

313
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,000
that it has the linguistic system and 
unknown linguistic system.

314
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,373
Partly the way to think about that is 
that you know you're the top part of 

315
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,410
your brain,
the cortical cap.

316
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,240
You can kind of think about that as a 
plenary valence territory.

317
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,853
Lots of things could happen to it,
and what happens is that as you develop 

318
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,413
the underlying systems,
the more biologically archaic systems 

319
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,390
colonize the Cortex.
They fight.

320
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,490
They fight basically,
so you know,

321
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,324
your ears in your eyes fight over which 
part of the back of the brain they're 

322
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,384
going to have access to and usually the 
eyes when at the back part of the brain 

323
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,360
in the years when more here.

324
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,610
But you know,
if you don't have any eyes,

325
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:40,160
the ears are going to call an ice the 
visual systems.

326
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,170
And that's partly why.
If you can't see,

327
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,730
you can hear better.
So,

328
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,564
and even if you lose your hand,
like if you lose your thumb when you're 

329
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:49,040
an adult,
what'll happen is the part,

330
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,440
the motor cortex that represents your 
fingers will grow.

331
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,513
It'll grow into that area so that these 
get you have more brain now devoted 

332
00:17:56,521 --> 00:18:00,150
towards these fingers.
And if you're born without hands and use

333
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:00,984
your feet,
than the feet will start to develop a 

334
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:05,430
map that looks like the map of the hand.
And there's some,

335
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,530
there's some flexibility in that even in
adulthood.

336
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,813
So there's,
there are these underlying systems that 

337
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,700
grow up and you know,
they,

338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,570
they,
uh,

339
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,403
expand their capacity for 
differentiation and synthesis by 

340
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,753
occupying the cortex.
And that can happen in a variety of 

341
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,454
ways,
even though it tends to happen in the 

342
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,610
standard way during normal development.

343
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,090
So you could say it's better for your 
eyes to invade the visual cortex because

344
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,950
it's sort of set up for that.
But if they can't advance,

345
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,803
the visual cortex ended invades the 
auditory cortex that works like 90 

346
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,150
percent as well.
It's something like that.

347
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,193
So the,
the top cortical cap is somewhat 

348
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,490
specialized,
but it's not.

349
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,833
It's not.
It's not specialized to the degree that 

350
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:54,090
it's lost its plasticity for the first 
stages of development,

351
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,073
it's white child nurse.
Certain neuro psychology tends to be 

352
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,294
such a mess is because the child's brain
is so plastic that you can't really say 

353
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:05,820
with any certainty what any given part 
of it happens to be doing except down in

354
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,654
the,
you know,

355
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,200
in the ancient areas where were some 
stability has been attained.

356
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,633
So here's a way of conceptualizing the 
difference between the left and the 

357
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,380
right hemisphere.
Although again,

358
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,480
I wouldn't think about it that way.

359
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,760
Now the classic distinction is 
linguistic non-linguistic.

360
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,860
Now Goldberg puts that on his head.
He says,

361
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:26,490
no,
no,

362
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,570
linguistic non-linguistic is an emergent
property of a more fundamental division.

363
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,943
The more fundamental dee dee division is
between novelty and routine and anomaly 

364
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
and that maps onto the sorts of 
discussions that we've been having.

365
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,380
What do you have to deal with in the 
world?

366
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,120
Things that work the way you think they 
will and the way that you want them to,

367
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,440
and then things that don't,
so you have a system that works with the

368
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,780
things that work the way you want them 
to,

369
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,703
and you have another system that deals 
with the things that don't and roughly 

370
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,724
speaking in the standard human brain.
The right hemisphere seems to be wired 

371
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:07,860
for normal novelty detection,
emotional response,

372
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,873
and provisional processing.
Whereas the left hemisphere seems to be 

373
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:16,650
specialized for routinized activities 
and that would include representation in

374
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,484
language.

375
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,260
Now what happens,
for example,

376
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,050
if you practice a novel task,
is that when you first do it,

377
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,450
it's very computationally demanding and 
so you set out a lot of energy and a lot

378
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:28,284
of your brain is at work,
especially in the right hemisphere and 

379
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:31,524
as you practice it,
the right hemisphere stops working and 

380
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:34,884
the left hemisphere works more and more,
and then a big part of the left 

381
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,570
hemisphere works and then as you keep 
practicing it,

382
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,404
that moves back until there's little 
tiny part of your brain that's really 

383
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,930
active when you're doing it and you're 
good at it,

384
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,330
and so partly what happens is imagine it
this way,

385
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,430
is your brain.
When you're first trying to do something

386
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:52,264
complex,
it's maybe you're trying a new piano 

387
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:56,350
piece or maybe you're doing some 
improvisation.

388
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,630
It's like you're trying out all sorts of
things,

389
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:59,464
right?
A lot of it's error and error 

390
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:00,610
correction.

391
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,200
It's a bloody mess.
It's exhausting.

392
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,363
You're doing all this and you're getting
rid of that thing that doesn't work in 

393
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:07,870
that thing and you really practice this 
part that's awkward,

394
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,590
and as you do that,
there are fewer and fewer errors.

395
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,160
Less variability and more and more 
routinized,

396
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,473
and as you're doing that,
you're building a little machine at the 

397
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,710
back of your head that does this 
perfectly,

398
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,530
but that Rita can't do anything else.
Now,

399
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,423
that's really an interesting thing to 
think about because what it implies is 

400
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,853
whatever you practice,
you build into your implicit processing 

401
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,104
systems,
so be careful what you practice because 

402
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,364
once you get one of those little 
machines back there and it really knows 

403
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:43,300
what to do,
it's there.

404
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,523
Now you could build another little 
machine that stops it from doing what 

405
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:47,614
it's doing,
but it's pretty damn hard to get rid of 

406
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:50,710
that machine once you've built it.

407
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,710
And so if you build it cocaine consuming
and desiring machine in your head,

408
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,640
that machine might end up being more 
powerful than you are,

409
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,230
in which case you're basically ruined.
And that's really what happens to people

410
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,064
who are addicted because they build 
expertise in cocaine seeking and 

411
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,833
preparation and ingestion,
and it's really a powerful system 

412
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:17,350
because it gets hit by dopamine every 
time it's successful,

413
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,850
so it grows into this like monstrous 
subpersonality and all that.

414
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:23,980
You need to activate that 
subpersonality,

415
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,933
even if it's been dormant for a long 
period of time and you know you're out 

416
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:31,270
of the addiction is the site of 
something associated with cocaine.

417
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,510
It's like up at comes and you're under 
the.

418
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,550
That's the monkey on your back,
so to speak.

419
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,384
And so what happens when you're trying 
to get people on addicted is that you 

420
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:44,920
can take them to a treatment center and 
let them go through all the minor league

421
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:45,754
horrors of withdrawal,
which are nowhere near as bad as people 

422
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:49,720
generally claim.

423
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,320
So like heroin withdrawal is like a very
bad flu for about four days.

424
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:57,070
It's not exactly pleasant,
but it's not like alcohol withdrawal,

425
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:57,904
which just kills you often.
So you let the person get through all 

426
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:02,224
that.
They're no longer dependent on the 

427
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,790
chemical and they're fine as long as 
they're in the treatment center,

428
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,624
but as soon as you put them back in 
their environment and they see like 

429
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,550
their friend Joe who's like,
you know,

430
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:15,370
they're drinking and cocaine partners 
like poof.

431
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,940
Up comes the monster and they're gone.
And it's very,

432
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,420
very difficult to treat addictions.
And that's because an addiction is not a

433
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:23,254
psychological thing,
it's like you built a real monster in 

434
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,304
your head and the pro and you're going 
to have to like bore him to death over 

435
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,080
years before it goes away.
And so,

436
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,023
and then if you're stressed,
well that's going to make it even more 

437
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,990
difficult for you to inhibit it.
And well,

438
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,820
it's a bloody mess.
It's a mess.

439
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,833
Or if you get money,
which is like the worst thing that can 

440
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,580
happen to you if your dad dicked,
you know,

441
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,443
it's like

442
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,783
I've had addicts as clients and the 
worst thing that ever happens to the MS 

443
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:52,744
dot payday,
it's like they're going on payday for 

444
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,900
like three days.
They're gone and then they come back and

445
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,620
they're all beat to death because they,
you know,

446
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,520
they've screwed up horribly and they're 
broke.

447
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:03,980
And so then they're safe till the next 
time they get some money.

448
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,203
So.
So these are the sorts of associations 

449
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:10,730
that go along with the novelty versus 
root and ization model of the brain.

450
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,320
So.
So it is,

451
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,450
right,
right versus left roughly.

452
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,100
But it's better to think of it the other
way.

453
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,993
Novelty versus routinized,
and so the novelty processing part of 

454
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:23,510
the brain is responsible for the 
production of negative emotion.

455
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,820
Why?
Well,

456
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,770
when you run into something that you 
don't expect,

457
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,173
you should immediately be cautious 
because it's something that you don't 

458
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,420
want might happen to you.

459
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,240
Now you can be excited because maybe 
something new will happen,

460
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,074
but the but the prudent thing to do is 
to be on alert first because God only 

461
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,530
knows where you are.
So negative effect is part of it.

462
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:47,870
The thing you don't understand is a 
threat.

463
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,930
That's the initial presumption and it's 
prudent.

464
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,710
And then the other thing the right 
hemisphere does is it stops your ongoing

465
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,120
behavior.
It does.

466
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,610
I would think about it as doing low 
resolution hypothesis generation.

467
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,610
So for example,
if you're alone at night,

468
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,290
say,
and uh,

469
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,090
I don't know,
maybe you've watched a horror movie,

470
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:08,924
so you've got yourself nice and primed 
and it's like one in the morning and 

471
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,434
you're tired and you haven't eaten 
anything for awhile and you hear some 

472
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,284
weird noise in a room upstairs.
Images are going to flash through your 

473
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,064
head and they're basically hypotheses 
about what might be up there and you 

474
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,314
know,
they can take bizarre form like 

475
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,990
especially if you've been watching a 
horror movie,

476
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,640
you know,
God only knows what you said,

477
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,730
some serial killer with like a hockey 
mask up there or something you know,

478
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,840
but what your right hemisphere do is 
doing is a very rapid,

479
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:40,380
quick and dirty processing of what the 
horrible thing might be and that,

480
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,214
that you're on alert and you need to 
kind of know what might be there and so 

481
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,194
you over you know,
you overestimate might be the worst 

482
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,170
thing you can imagine.

483
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,550
And that freeze you like a rat.
And if nothing else happens,

484
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,384
then well maybe it'll hide under the bed
which you know might be a useful 

485
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:57,584
solution.
Or probably you'll like walk upstairs 

486
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:00,974
and see what happens as you walk.
And if nothing comes leaping out and 

487
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,270
killing you,
then you'll think,

488
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,403
well,
it's at least not the sort of monster 

489
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,670
that leaps out and kills you when you 
were walking up the stairs in the dark.

490
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,743
And so you're narrowing it.
You're developing a higher and higher 

491
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,280
resolution model of the thing.
Then you know,

492
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,410
you go upstairs and you'll find that,
I don't know,

493
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,370
maybe your cat knocked a stuffed animal 
onto the floor or something,

494
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,710
you know,
it narrows it down to irrelevancy,

495
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,843
but your right hemisphere is going to be
doing the initial quick and dirty 

496
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,353
processing and those are,
those are low resolution 

497
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,160
representations.
They're often archetipal,

498
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,673
you know,
it's like

499
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,160
things that go bump in the night.
What's a big category?

500
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,541
And you might think,
well,

501
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:45,570
is that a category?
It's like it's a reasonable category.

502
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,703
Things in the night that might hurt you.
That's the category of monsters 

503
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,210
fundamentally.
So,

504
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,440
and you know what you might say,
well,

505
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,274
there's no such thing as monsters while 
we already went through that with the 

506
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,370
little book,
didn't we?

507
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,400
So of course there are.
It's just a low resolution category,

508
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,043
you know,
so.

509
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,090
But that doesn't mean it isn't useful.
Larger Motor actions are associated with

510
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:11,490
the part of the brain that does novelty 
processing.

511
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,170
And again,
that's kind of low resolution,

512
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,670
right?
Because when you really figure something

513
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,340
out,
you can fiddle around with it in detail,

514
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:19,860
but if you're reacting in a quick and 
dirty manner,

515
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:24,861
you're using your whole body so and on 
the on the route and ization side of the

516
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,100
equation.

517
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,933
You've got positive emotion moving 
forward because it's much more 

518
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:34,254
appropriate to move forward and fully 
articulated territory because you know 

519
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,214
what you're doing and so if you 
understand the territory and you've 

520
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,454
articulated it,
then the probability that you're going 

521
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:44,174
to get what you want when you're there,
it's going to be very high word 

522
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,240
processing,
linear thinking,

523
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,460
detailed recognition,
detail generation,

524
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,473
fine motor action.
The actual physiological structure of 

525
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,074
the left hemisphere is more 
differentiated than the physiological 

526
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,740
structure of the right hemisphere as 
well,

527
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,813
and I want another way to think about it
I think is that the novelty processing 

528
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,180
unit,
which is non linguistic,

529
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,450
is actually under the control of the 
underlying limit.

530
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,780
LIMBIC and hypothalamic systems.
So it's bottom up.

531
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:15,780
It's sort of the part of your brain that
still acts like an animal act.

532
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,410
Whereas the linguistic part,
that's sort of the you that you think of

533
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,370
yourself as.

534
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,443
That's where the,
roughly speaking that the ego that's 

535
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,074
talking to itself resides and I think it
is capable of top down control to a 

536
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:33,600
larger degree than a novelty processing 
unit,

537
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:34,434
which is still working as a quick and 
dirty defense system and is highly 

538
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:43,290
motivated by more primordial systems.
So how.

539
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,143
Okay,
so that's another way of thinking about 

540
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:45,864
it.
Um,

541
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,813
we can zero in a little bit more.
There's been a lot of work on a brain 

542
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,144
area called the hippocampus and the 
hippocampus is the part of the brain 

543
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,880
that moves information from short term 
attention to longterm storage.

544
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,170
It seems to do that across time.
So for example,

545
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:09,171
if you suffer a maybe impact induced 
amnesia,

546
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,523
a little bit of oxygen deprivation,
the hippocampus was a very active part 

547
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:15,720
of the brain.
And so it doesn't like being deprived of

548
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,554
oxygen.
And so if you have brain trauma and you 

549
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,700
get oxygen deprived,
it'll damage the hippocampus.

550
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,790
And then what often happens is you can't
remember the accident.

551
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,030
You can't remember what happened for six
months before the accident.

552
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,820
Your memory over the last 18 months is 
pretty hazy,

553
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,654
but the farther back you go in time,
the more likely you are to have access 

554
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:35,634
to the memories.
So what seems to happen is the 

555
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,080
hippocampus seems to.
It does a bunch of things.

556
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,930
It moves.
It's.

557
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,003
It probably organizes your 
autobiographical information initially 

558
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,593
and then as it's elaborated in memory,
it moves up into critical 

559
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:53,434
representations and becomes more 
permanent and maybe articulation has 

560
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,730
something to do with that.
Like I have a suspicion that partly what

561
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:01,564
you're doing when you're doing the 
writing that you already did is you're 

562
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:04,774
moving information more and more 
permanently into cortical 

563
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:12,070
representation,
cortical semantic representation.

564
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,820
You're detaching it from its underlying 
emotional substrate,

565
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,520
so the hippocampus seems to be 
responsible for that.

566
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,353
So if you take people whose hippocampus 
because there's two of them have been 

567
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,790
destroyed.
There are a few clinical case reports of

568
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,624
people like that.
They can't develop any new 

569
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,953
autobiographical memory.
So the famous most famous of those 

570
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:32,044
patients was a guy named h,
m who had bilateral hippocampus damage 

571
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:37,420
partly from surgery and partly from 
epilepsy,

572
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,493
and he was stuck in 1957 for 40 years.
He couldn't even really recognize 

573
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,624
himself in a mirror because it was like 
the old him and although he could learn 

574
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:50,830
new procedures quite well as well as a 
normal person,

575
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,550
he so he could learn a new procedure by 
practicing it day after day.

576
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,620
But if you showed them the thing he 
learned,

577
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,090
he'd say,
I never saw that before,

578
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:58,924
even though he got much better at it.
And so he was one of the first cases 

579
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,240
that showed that memory systems were 
dissociable.

580
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,540
So anyways,
the hippocampus is a big deal now.

581
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,340
The Russian neuropsychologist,
solar carve and vinegar Dov [inaudible],

582
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,200
followed by Jeffrey Gray,
followed up on this cybernetic model via

583
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:21,370
Luria and they came up with the 
hypothesis that what the hippocampus was

584
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:22,204
doing was comparing what you expected to
happen in the world with what was 

585
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,270
happening.
Okay.

586
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,104
So it's an expectation based model.
The idea was because they were 

587
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:32,794
behaviorists,
the idea was there are stimuli in the 

588
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:37,000
world,
they're actually there,

589
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,163
you're monitoring them,
you have a sense of what's going to 

590
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:42,400
happen,
which is a cognitive expectation,

591
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,150
and as long as the two things are 
occurring,

592
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,673
then your emotions,
particularly your threat response is 

593
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,823
inhibited.
So the threat system is sort of always 

594
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,264
on,
but as long as everything is happening 

595
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,980
the way you expect it to happen,
then it's inhibited.

596
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,150
Now,
the way it's inhibited,

597
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:04,984
it seems to be at something like this,
there's a part of the brain that's very 

598
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:09,994
deep called the reticular activating 
system and the reticular activating 

599
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:15,700
system is an ascending stream of of 
neuronal connections,

600
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,534
and if you're in a car accident and 
twist your head and you snap that 

601
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,860
tracked because it's.

602
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,140
It's quite.
It's actually fairly fragile.

603
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,620
Then your unconscious forever and that's
that.

604
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,813
So it's very,
very important track and it seems to be 

605
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,474
governing arousal.
What governs your emergence into 

606
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:36,940
consciousness and your dissenting to 
unconsciousness at night.

607
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,080
Very,
very,

608
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,290
very old brain system.
And it is.

609
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,800
What it seems to happen is that the 
hippocampus detects a mismatch.

610
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,563
It,
it's tonically inhibiting the reticular 

611
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,474
activating system,
so as long as everything is going 

612
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,204
according to expectation,
the reticular activating system isn't 

613
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:56,774
sending a message to the Amygdala and 
other systems that are primarily 

614
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:00,734
associated with emotion.
It's not sending a signal to them 

615
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,700
saying,
wake the hell up,

616
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,983
but as soon as there's a mismatch,
then the hippocampus inhibition of the 

617
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,563
reticular activating system declines and
the Amygdala and other emotional 

618
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,840
systems,
motivational systems as well turn on,

619
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,483
so or are or are no longer inhibited,
which is a better way of thinking about 

620
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:23,420
it.
Okay,

621
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:27,830
so now the.
So when gray,

622
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:28,664
who is also one of the cybernetic 
theorists talks about what happens when 

623
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:32,444
you hit something that's unexpected.
He basically says you have to revamp 

624
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:37,694
your motor programs and your 
expectations of the future in order to 

625
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,813
reconcile the error and that that's a 
complex process and it requires 

626
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:51,350
exploration.
But the problem with that theory is

627
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,513
you don't have access to the present.
You have a model of the present and you 

628
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:04,570
don't expect things to happen.
You want them to happen and so what that

629
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:07,480
means is if they don't happen the way 
you want them to,

630
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,463
you have a bigger problem than the 
cognitive cybernetic theorists 

631
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,413
originally envisioned and the problem is
the place where the error might be is 

632
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:21,280
way bigger.
It might be in what you want.

633
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,413
It might be in how you put together,
what you want with the other things you 

634
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:25,504
want.
It might be how you put together all 

635
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:28,690
those things with what other people 
want.

636
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,823
It might be something wrong with your 
conception of your abilities at the 

637
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:35,500
present time.
It might be a skill deficit and it might

638
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:38,860
be something that's gone astray with 
your conceptualization of the future,

639
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,510
how it's a big search space and so 
that's part of the reason.

640
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
So you might say,
well,

641
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:46,870
what should you do when you hit 
something you don't expect?

642
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:51,100
And the answer to that is you default to
emergency preparation.

643
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,430
Now how much do you default?
Well,

644
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,293
we don't quite understand the rat 
representation yet because it's 

645
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,340
associated with this hierarchical 
problem we already described.

646
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,060
So I think it's got to be something like
this.

647
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,733
Your brain must be able to tell somehow 
how much of it's structure is dependent 

648
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:17,140
on a given on the viability of a given 
node,

649
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,423
so so imagine that you have a 
representation and hardly anything 

650
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:26,200
depends on that representation and that 
representation is disrupted.

651
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:26,761
It's like,
yeah,

652
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:30,610
that's no big deal because it's only 
knocking out a part of what you're using

653
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:31,444
to orient yourself in the world.
But if it's a fundamental 

654
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,010
presupposition,
maybe like the presence,

655
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,883
the continued presence,
a loved one on which all your other 

656
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:40,524
plans are predicated because you can 
imagine that sort of as a neural 

657
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,524
structure,
if it's way down at the bottom and the 

658
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:50,070
neural structure is branching off from 
that and that gets disrupted.

659
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:50,904
It looks like that the hippocampal 
septal system has some ability to sense 

660
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,240
the degree to which a given 
conceptualization is fundamental and the

661
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,140
maybe that has something to do with how 
early in life it was laid down.

662
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,371
You know,
because you,

663
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,204
you know that once you make a 
presupposition in childhood to Orient 

664
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,573
Yourself than other,
more finely grained presuppositions are 

665
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:14,544
going to emerge from that.
So maybe it has something to do with 

666
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,490
depth of representation in the brain,
like,

667
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,603
or,
or the branching or the are account of 

668
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:27,180
the branches that come off that I don't 
know and I don't think anybody does,

669
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,570
but there has to be an association of 
that sort.

670
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:31,404
Yep.

671
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,133
Well,
I can tell you one thing that's been 

672
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:38,934
done about that.
So this is the kind of science that 

673
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,384
people hate.
You may or may not know that I'm 

674
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,463
Ashkenazi Jews.
European Jews on average have an Iq 

675
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:54,270
that's about 15 points higher than the 
rest of the Caucasian population.

676
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,463
And that's a lot.
And that's part of the reason why 

677
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:00,090
they're massively overrepresented,
for example,

678
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,730
among,
well among people in most high level,

679
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,920
um,
occupations,

680
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,754
but among Nobel prize winners and so on,
they're also much more prone to neural 

681
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,790
diseases that are associated with 
hypergrowth.

682
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,820
So the fact that their brains are more 
plastic in some sense,

683
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,654
comes along with susceptibility to a 
variety of diseases of the nervous 

684
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:23,220
system.
So that,

685
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,990
so there's an intelligence,
um,

686
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,350
proliferation problem there.
So your brain can be so plastic that it,

687
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,090
it starts to become abnormal.
So,

688
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,170
so we also know with regards to openness
per say,

689
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,083
that one of the,
here's one of the best tests for 

690
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:41,920
openness.
We could do this right now.

691
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,310
I don't think we will,
but if I say,

692
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,144
okay,
take out a piece of paper and a pen and 

693
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:48,084
write down as many words as you can that
begin with the letter s in three 

694
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,874
minutes.
There's gonna be a lot of variation in 

695
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:53,484
this group.
I would think it would be from 50 to 

696
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,760
200.
Um,

697
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,920
the people who can write down more 
words,

698
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,860
they're higher in openness,
they're more creative as well,

699
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,540
isn't it?
It's a pretty good predictor.

700
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,170
So that isn't so much,
I think an indication necessarily of the

701
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:10,074
complexity of the branches,
but it's certainly an indication how 

702
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,650
rapidly you can access the information 
that's in those branches.

703
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,930
So,
okay.

704
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,823
So,
so that's how you maintained emotional 

705
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,034
stability.
The way you intend emotional stability 

706
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:31,560
is something like you have a conception 
of how the world should lay itself out.

707
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:32,394
When you act as long as that conception 
and your model of what's happening 

708
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:37,924
match.
Then your hippocampus tells your 

709
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,414
reticular activation,
reticular activating system to leave 

710
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,270
your motivational and emotional systems 
dormant,

711
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,490
and then if there's a mismatch,
it's like it's time to wake the hell up

712
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,820
in your paper when you're talking about 
the map.

713
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,910
Hypothalamus,
we haven't talked about that yet,

714
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,010
but that's,
that's a perfectly reasonable question.

715
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,660
That's actually why I'm.

716
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,310
That was the most stable psychological 
as well.

717
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,553
What was,
you mentioned that motivation is 

718
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,190
motivation provides most stable of the 
same logical strategy.

719
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,791
Oh yeah.
Okay.

720
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,230
So,
so far so good.

721
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:47,900
Couldn't conceptualize the brain like 
this.

722
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:48,734
You know,
you hear about emotions and motivations 

723
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,773
and I'd say,
well those are low resolution boxes 

724
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,803
because it actually turns out that if 
you look at each of the major 

725
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,940
motivational systems and you know,
you can argue about what they are,

726
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,060
but we can kind of lay them out.
Pain is one that's for sure.

727
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:04,460
That's an old one.
Thirst,

728
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,170
hunger,
sexual drive,

729
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:10,250
defensive aggression,
a predatory aggression,

730
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,180
a play.
I'm a love pair.

731
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,830
Bonding.
Um,

732
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,170
what else?
And then there's basic emotions,

733
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:19,004
you know,
those there's like hope and surprise 

734
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:23,120
and,
and joy and fear.

735
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,580
And uh,
um,

736
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,980
discussed and that's good enough.
You get the picture,

737
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:30,050
you know,
when you can expand that and contract it

738
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:32,900
depending on how you conceptualize it.
And you can say,

739
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:33,734
well some of those are motivational 
systems and some of them was her 

740
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,410
emotional systems.

741
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,550
And the actual answer to that is,
well,

742
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:45,551
not exactly because that's only a low 
resolution categorization system.

743
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,370
It might be useful to distinguish them 
from cognitive systems,

744
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:50,204
but the truth of the matter is that each
of those systems has its own 

745
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:55,604
neurological substrate and those 
neurological substrates are not 

746
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,284
identical.
Like there's some similarities between 

747
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:03,830
them,
but there's lots of differences.

748
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,873
And so some things are more emotional 
and some things are sort of half like 

749
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:10,670
emotions and motivations.
Anger is sort of like that.

750
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,743
And then some things are more pure 
motivations because hunger people don't 

751
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:18,980
generally think of that as an emotion 
and I think it has to do mostly with the

752
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:19,814
propensity of the underlying system to 
establish an entire framework of 

753
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:25,640
reference.
So hunger will do that.

754
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,010
Um,
anger will do that,

755
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,680
thirst will do that,
sexual drives will do that.

756
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,330
They come up,
they,

757
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,960
there's a associated with them,
it wants something,

758
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,180
it sees the world in that manner.

759
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,263
It,
it primes a certain class of behaviors 

760
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:44,840
that are associated with that and it 
runs like a partial personality,

761
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,033
but then something like fear seems to be
more something that exists and operates 

762
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:52,790
within a framework rather than producing
its own framework.

763
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,923
So it doesn't matter.
The point is there's a lot of these 

764
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:56,414
underlying systems and they have the 
capacity to set up these frameworks of 

765
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:05,090
reference that we're talking about and 
to run the mass processes.

766
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,193
Yeah,
and the reason I said they're stable is 

767
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:11,990
because they'll.
The deeper you'd go down into the brain,

768
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,380
the older the brain part is and the 
hypothalamus,

769
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,483
it's really,
really old and it's so powerful that if 

770
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,204
you take your whole brain off,
except for the hypothalamus and the 

771
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,820
spinal cord,
which leaves you with no brain at all.

772
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,043
If you're a cat,
which is a pretty complicated thing and 

773
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:31,900
you're female,
you can still pretty much exists.

774
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,710
So if you put a female cat in a box and 
you take its brain off,

775
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,760
including even the emotional sectors and
you just leave it with the hypothalamus,

776
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,803
if you watch the cat can't handle novel 
environments obviously because it can't 

777
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,830
really learn.
But it can do cat things.

778
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,390
No problem.
It can feed itself,

779
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:53,390
it can engage in defensive aggression,
it can mate,

780
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,000
it can generally interact with its 
kittens.

781
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,910
And one of the weird things is,
this is so funny,

782
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,720
a cat with no brain is hyper 
exploratory.

783
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,513
It's like you think what the hell?
It's like you'd think it'd be the brand 

784
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:09,080
that's doing the exploring.
It's like no,

785
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:09,914
it's the hypothalamus that's motivating 
the exploring the brain stores the 

786
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:16,280
results of the exploring and shuts the 
exploration off.

787
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,820
So if you take the brain off then the 
cat just runs around and trying to learn

788
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,830
things.
But it can't because it doesn't remember

789
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:22,940
anything.
So.

790
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:23,774
But it's quite fascinating because we 
tend to think of the top part of the 

791
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,990
brain is so bloody important.
It's like a no

792
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,713
is what

793
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,980
take the whole critical cap off and 
almost all the emotional systems,

794
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,570
like 85 percent of the braid.

795
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,073
Nope.

796
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,400
Yes,
no motor cortex.

797
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,150
It's running on reflex.
If you're interested,

798
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:59,540
I actually have some diagrams of it,
but look up decorticate cat,

799
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,620
you know,
you can.

800
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,490
There's lots of.
Yeah,

801
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:05,061
well,
I mean,

802
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:06,080
you know,
other people did,

803
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:06,914
a lot of people have done a lot of 
experiments on animals and their 

804
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:14,660
neurological function and one of the 
things they were interested in as well,

805
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,580
how much brain can you remove and still 
have a functioning animal?

806
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,270
And the answer is pretty much all of it.
And that's like,

807
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,100
well,
who the hell would possible?

808
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,500
And if you're interested in that,
I would read Swanson again.

809
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,040
Uh,
and I'm sure that papers on the websites

810
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,420
that sorenson paper,
now that's a work of genius,

811
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:33,254
that thing.

812
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,373
Oh,
because they're male sexual behavior is 

813
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:43,290
harder to organize.
And so decorticate males can mate.

814
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,780
So if you ever meet a male who can't 
mate,

815
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,380
then anyways,
sorry.

816
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,700
But that's,
that's,

817
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,920
that's the reason is that there are 
certain elements of,

818
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,520
of male sexual behavior that required 
more complex organization.

819
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,763
So,
so that's one thing a decorticate male 

820
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,564
can't do.
So it's easier to distinguish them from 

821
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:03,870
females,
from the female cats.

822
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,250
That's,
that's the only reason.

823
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,181
So,
okay,

824
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,880
so you get the idea.
So like at the bottom of the brain,

825
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,714
there's all these systems that are 
really alive and sort of on fire and 

826
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,550
they're all generating up these 
motivational frames of reference and,

827
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,820
and they,
they do that,

828
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,010
that's instinct,
so to speak,

829
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:20,844
you know,
and then all of that's elaborate it up 

830
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,210
by the cortex and the Cortex is saying,
okay,

831
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:29,070
well these things are like a pack of 
fighting two year olds.

832
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,933
So by the way,
and I mean that because if you take 

833
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,290
children and you put them in age matched
groups and you.

834
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,153
So you have a group of 18 months olds 
and two year olds and three year olds 

835
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,224
and four year olds and so all the way up
to 16 year olds say and then you count 

836
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,780
violent interactions,
kicking,

837
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,501
hitting,
biting,

838
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,690
stealing.
The two year olds are like,

839
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,913
they're just all over that,
but it's not actually quite right 

840
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,320
because some of the two year olds are 
peaceful and passive,

841
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,154
but there's a subset of the two year 
olds that are like chaotic motivational 

842
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:00,960
machines,
right?

843
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:04,170
They're just running around being as 
impulsive as can possibly be,

844
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:05,004
and you can think about them as under 
almost under complete hypothalamus 

845
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,853
control.
You're just cycling from one intense 

846
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:13,530
motivational state to another that makes
two year olds a blast.

847
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,393
Like they're really fun to be around 
except they're kind of a pain in the 

848
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:16,794
neck,
but they're really fun because they're 

849
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,800
really on fire.
They're into this and into that,

850
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,693
into this,
and then they fall down because they're 

851
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:22,344
too tired and then they wake up and 
they're starving to death and you know 

852
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,524
they're really alive.
But then what has to happen is that 

853
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,010
those behaviors,
those motivational states,

854
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:36,090
which are sort of working in isolation,
they start to conflict with one another.

855
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,043
You know,
so that the child can't really organize 

856
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:42,840
any medium to longterm behavioral 
strategies being that impulsive.

857
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,170
So what the CORTEX is there is to start 
sequencing those motivational systems in

858
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:49,674
higher order structures that allow each 
of them to get what they need in order 

859
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,054
to function across long periods of time 
in increasingly complex social 

860
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,360
environments.
That's what the CORTEX is for.

861
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,280
So it's a complex regulatory mechanism 
and what it's doing is keeping.

862
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,360
It's like a nuclear reactor.
The core is really hot and fiery and you

863
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:13,380
need to sync rods into it to keep it 
under control,

864
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,030
to dampen it.
Now it's really,

865
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:15,983
it's a good analogy for how your brain 
works because the underlying systems 

866
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,680
they're on,
they're on fire,

867
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:22,830
they're alive and the cortex is saying,
well,

868
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,083
a little bit of you now and a little bit
of you and then some of you and wait 

869
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,174
your turn and so on,
and it sequences out over stretches of 

870
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:30,784
time.
That's really socialization and that's 

871
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:35,050
quite a different view than the Freudian
view of repression,

872
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,643
you know?
Because I would say you only have to 

873
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:40,600
repress a motivational system if you're 
not very successful.

874
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,020
Because if you're a successful and well 
socialized person,

875
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,320
you don't have to suppress them or 
repress them,

876
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:48,154
you just have to sequence them.
That's all because they're all going to 

877
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:52,270
get what they want.
Right?

878
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,313
And that means that you're a good player
of complex social games and that has 

879
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,780
very little to do with repression or 
inhibition.

880
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,320
It's just sequencing.
It's important.

881
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,120
It's important.
What time do we have?

882
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,491
Okay.
Okay,

883
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:07,001
good.
Good,

884
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:07,834
good.

885
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,403
Oh,
so here's kind of an interesting way of 

886
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:13,114
looking at the Amygdala.
This is from a Joseph Ledoux wrote a 

887
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:17,704
lovely book on the Amygdala and it also 
kind of shows you how your body is 

888
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,140
structured.
And so,

889
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:25,360
you know,
I don't know if you've ever heard of the

890
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,120
phenomena of blind sight and do you know
what blind sight is?

891
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,390
Did I tell you about blind sight or did 
you learn that somewhere else?

892
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,411
Okay.
Well,

893
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,244
anyways,
one way of being blind is to go like 

894
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:36,964
this and then you can't see.
And another way is to have your retina 

895
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:43,680
destroyed and maybe the optic nerve 
could go another way of being blind.

896
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:44,514
Just have your visual cortex destroyed.
The thing about that's weird about 

897
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,084
having your visual cortex destroyed is 
that you think you can't see but you 

898
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,493
still can.
You just can't see the same way you saw 

899
00:48:56,501 --> 00:49:00,190
before and you can't see objects 
consciously.

900
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:05,200
But if someone says,
I've got one hand up,

901
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,540
which one is it?
And they say,

902
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,410
well,
I can't see it,

903
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:09,580
and you say,
guess.

904
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,880
Then they can guess,
and so you might say,

905
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:15,250
well how can that be?
And the answer to that is,

906
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:16,084
is that okay?
Imagine for a minute that the world 

907
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,164
isn't made out of objects.
Imagine that it's made out of patterns 

908
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,760
because it is made out of patterns.
Music is.

909
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,643
That's why music is so intensely 
interesting because it's a 

910
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:31,264
representation of the world as a place 
of patterns and a pattern is something 

911
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:38,680
that repeats because otherwise it 
wouldn't be a pattern and the only thing

912
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:41,950
you really need to keep track of things 
that repeat because there is no such.

913
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,323
There's no point knowing anything about 
things that don't repeat because what 

914
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:49,030
the hell good is your knowledge.
So the world is full of patterns.

915
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,253
What happens is that that pattern is 
transformed into a pattern on your 

916
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,050
retina.
It's a pattern of neuroactivation,

917
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,690
and then there's multiple branches from 
your retina,

918
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,800
doesn't just go one place,
it goes lots of places and each of those

919
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:03,634
places it goes,
produces its own implementation of that 

920
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:07,924
pattern,
and one of those implementations allows 

921
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:11,134
you to see the world consciously,
but other implementations have other 

922
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:15,430
functions.
So for example,

923
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:16,264
if you show someone with flying site and
angry face and you record their 

924
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:24,610
psychophysiological responses and you 
show them a neutral or a smiling face,

925
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,833
you can distinguish their physiological 
responses to the angry or fearful face 

926
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:30,314
from the happy or neutral face,
and the reason for that is that one of 

927
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:34,784
the patterns that your retina is,
is picking up is the facial 

928
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:39,374
configurations of human being 
specifically because that's really 

929
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,590
important to us and that's delivered to 
a specific part of your brain.

930
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,970
It seems to be,
at least in part,

931
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
the Amygdala and what the Amygdala does 
basically is says this.

932
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,570
I don't know.
That's not very good.

933
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,583
This means this,
so it maps that pattern onto this 

934
00:50:59,001 --> 00:50:59,834
pattern.
You don't need to see anything for that 

935
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:01,970
to happen,
right?

936
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:04,850
You just have to translate the pattern 
into motor action.

937
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,860
Lots of animals see that way.
So like when when a fly flies by a frog,

938
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,903
the frog doesn't see the fly and think,
well there's a fly and then like nails 

939
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:13,814
it with its tongue.
It's like the fly flying by pattern 

940
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:17,834
activates the tongue sticking out 
pattern and it does it in like 100th of 

941
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,544
a second as as a obviously because like 
have you ever tried to catch a fly with 

942
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:27,014
your tongue?
It's like it's not easy but a frog can 

943
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,624
really do it.
And the fact that the frogs visual 

944
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,504
system is so simple and specialized 
means that there's hardly any neural 

945
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:36,994
connections between the perception of 
the pattern of the fly and the motor 

946
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:41,150
response.

947
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,983
Like maybe there's two neurons 
intermediate thing and so that frog and 

948
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,880
nail that fly right now.
Whereas you,

949
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,043
you're going to wait around until you 
see the fly and then you know you're 

950
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:54,770
going to swat it and a fly sees this 
loophole and it's like it's gone for.

951
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,710
It's gone in a week of flight time.
By the time you hit the,

952
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,100
by the time you hit the you know the 
table with your flyswatter.

953
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,350
You don't want to rely on your conscious
vision to do extraordinarily fast things

954
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:08,600
because it takes under normal 
conditions.

955
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:09,434
It takes maybe a quarter to half a 
second to become consciously aware of a 

956
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,823
phenomenal logical entity.
It's like for snakes or things like 

957
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:18,231
that,
man,

958
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,790
they've bitten you by the time you see 
them.

959
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:25,150
So what Luddu pointed out is that to the
underlying motivational areas,

960
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,833
there's lots of sensory inputs that 
bypass the representational processing 

961
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:33,860
that's characteristic of the cortex.

962
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,840
And so if you're walking down a path and
like a little snake like movement occurs

963
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:39,674
here,
you're going to catch that with the 

964
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:44,540
periphery of your vision.
Now try this.

965
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,820
So look at this finger,
okay?

966
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,930
Now look at the finger,
but concentrate on my face.

967
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,090
Okay?
Don't look at my face.

968
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,980
Okay?
You ready for that?

969
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,980
Okay.
Okay,

970
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:59,840
so what do you see?
What do you see?

971
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,873
Yeah,
you see the teeth and eyes and if like 

972
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,460
look again,
if you,

973
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:05,294
if you pay careful attention,
you'll be able to see that you cannot 

974
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:11,990
see my nose because who cares what my 
nose is doing.

975
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:14,120
You don't care,
you're Mengele certainly doesn't care.

976
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,210
So why bother seeing it?
You're a make dilla cares about what the

977
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,044
hell you're eyes are pointing out and 
whether or not your teeth are there and 

978
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:23,060
it cares about that with other creatures
too.

979
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,283
And so your peripheral vision is low 
resolution is wired up to detect 

980
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:28,644
movement and threat and what does the 
detection is super fast because well it 

981
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,400
better be.
Are you going to get bit?

982
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:38,520
Okay.
So one day I was in California and I was

983
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:43,521
walking down this pathway on a cliff or 
facing the ocean in La and it was,

984
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:47,460
I think it was march or something and 
there was this guy in front of me,

985
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:48,294
this is like six foot seven and right in
front of him was his four year old 

986
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:51,414
daughter.
So we're walking along and all of a 

987
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,000
sudden she goes and jumps right onto his
shoulders.

988
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,190
It was like,
you know what cats,

989
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,590
like when you started just poof and runs
this,

990
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,580
a very funny thing to do to cats.
Um,

991
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,660
there was a rattlesnake right beside the
path.

992
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,970
Now it was kind of slow because it was 
cold,

993
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,043
but obviously what had happened to her 
is her periphery caught the rattlesnake 

994
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,520
and she was up in her father's shoulders
before,

995
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,620
before she saw the snake.

996
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,440
And it's a good thing because if it was 
a stick,

997
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,600
well who cares?
She's expanded a little energy,

998
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:22,703
you know,
so the Amygdala can be kind of low 

999
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,950
resolution and it's still useful.
But if it,

1000
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,180
if it was a snake and it was going to 
strike the fact that she had jumped onto

1001
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:33,990
his shoulders before she even saw it was
going to save her.

1002
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,380
And so one of the things that in 
principle,

1003
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,693
the underlying motivational systems are 
wired up to detect our primary fear 

1004
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,020
stimuli.
And so those would be.

1005
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:48,060
You can kind of list them off now for a 
long time.

1006
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:49,950
People thought,
you learn to be afraid,

1007
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,440
which I told you is a rubbish.
She learned not to be afraid.

1008
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:53,723
Then they thought that you could learn 
to be afraid to some things more easily 

1009
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:01,110
than others,
but you still had to be exposed to those

1010
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:03,260
things and then they figured out,
no,

1011
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,890
no,
there's just things you're afraid of.

1012
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,970
And one of those things is snakes and 
chimpanzees for example,

1013
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:12,240
they don't like snakes and even if you 
raise chimps and monkeys,

1014
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,640
so they never see a snake and you show 
them a snake,

1015
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:18,810
they are not happy about the snake.
So the snakes like Uber Predator,

1016
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,850
you know,
I found now that mammals,

1017
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,640
I should have known this,
been around for about 220 million years.

1018
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:24,474
So we've been battling with reptiles for
a very long period of time right back 

1019
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:32,721
when there were dinosaurs anyways.
So the idea that like predatory reptiles

1020
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:35,850
are a bad thing that's way deep down 
inside of us.

1021
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:40,320
And so we have systems that we've 
conserved as we've evolved,

1022
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,610
not because they're accurate but because
they're really damn fast.

1023
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:48,420
And so one of the things your retinal 
patterns do is map themselves right onto

1024
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:50,970
your spinal cord.
And that's super fast,

1025
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:53,970
super low resolution.
So it means your eyes can make your body

1026
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:54,804
move.

1027
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,360
There's almost no intermediation of 
thinking.

1028
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,470
And so the old behavioral ideas that you
were a stimulus response machine,

1029
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:02,903
we're right,
except that you're a stimulus response 

1030
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:08,280
machine with a bunch of more complex 
processes built on top of that.

1031
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,210
But the stimulus response machine is 
still there and the reason it's there is

1032
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:13,044
because it's super fast.
And so there are these multiple levels 

1033
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:22,071
of the nervous system and as you go down
into more and more fundamental systems,

1034
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:23,723
they're faster and more stereotyped.
And as you move up there are more 

1035
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:28,114
complex and slower and the sensory 
systems have input more or less at each 

1036
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:32,824
level.
And so partly what your brain is trying 

1037
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:35,614
to figure out is when should you use the
quick and dirty systems and wind should 

1038
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,930
use the Slo and contemplate of systems.
And the answer is,

1039
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,910
if it's a primary fear stimuli,
which would be fire teeth,

1040
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,740
skeletons,
blood Genetalia,

1041
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,430
generally speaking,
I'm Saudi it.

1042
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,653
Oh,
uh,

1043
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,780
uh,
immobile bodies.

1044
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,820
Well,
and then there's all sorts of noises.

1045
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,650
Baby cries.
For example,

1046
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:07,800
we just did an experiment.
I told you guys about latent inhibition.

1047
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,660
Do you remember that?
Maybe not.

1048
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:10,973
If I,
uh,

1049
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:16,660
if you listen to a bunch of numbers and 
in the background you hear a white noise

1050
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,653
burst,

1051
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,093
sure.

1052
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,263
So maybe I get you to listen to that for
three minutes and I tell you to count 

1053
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:24,140
your number.
Okay?

1054
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:25,543
Then I play the same soundtrack and I 
show you a bunch of lights and the 

1055
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:32,150
lights go on one by one.
And I tried to get you to predict what's

1056
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,140
turning those lights on.
If I may get the white noise burst,

1057
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,040
and you've already heard that for three 
minutes when it didn't signify anything,

1058
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,430
it's going to be very difficult for you 
to learn that the white noise bursts are

1059
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:44,264
now what turns on the lights.
So the way you determine that as you 

1060
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,340
play people before exposing them to the 
lights,

1061
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:53,840
one tape that has the white noise bursts
and another tape that doesn't.

1062
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:57,710
And then you play both of them,
both groups,

1063
00:57:57,711 --> 00:58:00,680
the white noise burst and the numbers 
and turn on the lights,

1064
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:01,514
and the people who weren't pre-exposure 
to the white noise learn it faster by a 

1065
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:07,820
substantial amount that's called latent 
inhibition.

1066
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,070
And that's what makes things invisible 
for you.

1067
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,020
You see things,
nothing happens.

1068
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,820
You learned to ignore them,
they're irrelevant.

1069
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,800
So you're using latent inhibition to 
eradicate their relevance.

1070
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,083
We did it with baby cries.
People don't develop latent inhibition 

1071
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:23,324
to baby cry.
So if you put a little baby crying in 

1072
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:25,394
the back instead of white noise,
it doesn't matter how many times do you 

1073
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,170
expose the person to it,
they,

1074
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,700
they learned that the baby cried turns 
on the lights right away.

1075
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,620
And so what I'm thinking is that the way
that your brain makes things relevant is

1076
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:37,454
it makes everything irrelevant except 
for certain categories of things that 

1077
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:43,520
you can't learn to habituate to no 
matter what you do.

1078
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,890
And those would be the categories I just
described.

1079
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,143
You know,
and the fact that Janet Halley are part 

1080
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,520
of that,
especially for men,

1081
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:50,354
if it's pictorial representations,
accounts for the absolutely addictive 

1082
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,530
nature of pornography,
so you can't,

1083
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:58,220
you cannot habituate to the images,
although men do to some degree,

1084
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,250
but it's very difficult habituate to 
those images.

1085
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,760
So,
okay,

1086
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:06,594
so your brain assumes that everything is
relevant and important until you learn 

1087
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:10,200
that it isn't.
And once you learn it,

1088
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:11,940
it isn't.
You don't even pay any attention to it.

1089
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,710
And then your brain basically removes 
the blocking from things

1090
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,400
dependent on your state of motivation.
That's what makes it relevant.

1091
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,080
So for example,
if you get hungry,

1092
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,943
if you're not hungry,
foods irrelevant if you are hungry than 

1093
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,180
the latent inhibition gets stripped off 
the food.

1094
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,640
And so all of a sudden it's all 
meaningful and interesting.

1095
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,760
Again,
just like it was before you're,

1096
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,250
before you learned that it was 
irrelevant.

1097
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,200
Um,
here's the list of Amygdala output.

1098
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,153
Same idea basically apply.
So the sensory systems put input into 

1099
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,144
multiple levels of the nervous system,
but the emotional systems and the 

1100
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:57,020
motivational systems also have multiple 
levels of output to the brain hierarchy.

1101
00:59:57,021 --> 01:00:02,021
So I'm Ledoux is identified,
this is partly associated with anxiety,

1102
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,030
Tachycardia,
increased heart rate,

1103
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,830
galvanic skin response,
Paleness,

1104
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:08,210
pupil dilation,
blood pressure,

1105
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:11,960
elevation ulcers.
This is more chronic urination,

1106
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:13,850
defecation,
again,

1107
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:15,290
Bradycardia,
panting,

1108
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:18,650
respiratory distress,
behavioral and Eeg arousal,

1109
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,660
increased vigilance,
increased attention,

1110
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,550
heightened startle,
freezing hyperalgesia,

1111
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:26,783
so you can't feel pain as much.
Facial expressions of fear and 

1112
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:32,000
corticosteroid release.
So you see that when you say,

1113
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:32,990
well,
what's fear?

1114
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:34,100
It's like,
well,

1115
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,353
it's a multilevel phenomena and it 
manifests itself across different 

1116
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,300
hierarchies of the nervous system and so
and,

1117
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:45,350
and those systems different complexity.
And they did and they differ in speed,

1118
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,150
you know?
And the other thing for humans,

1119
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:47,984
what's happening if you encounter 
something anxiety producing is it sends 

1120
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:52,730
a signal up to the right hemisphere and 
it says,

1121
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:53,564
provide a quick and dirty model of this.
And then it tells the left hemisphere 

1122
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,253
and if you can explore a bunch together,
new information so that we can improve 

1123
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:00,554
the model.
And so that's basically how you're 

1124
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:05,990
responding to novelty.
Now the next thing I'm going to tell you

1125
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:11,050
not today is two things.
One is how these hierarchical systems

1126
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,010
emerge across time.
And how they're interrelated,

1127
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,083
but then,
and this is where we can really move in 

1128
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:23,480
another direction quickly,
I want to show you how these domains,

1129
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:26,720
because we've outlined some domains,
the domains are

1130
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,130
things that turn out the way you want 
them to,

1131
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:35,030
things that don't turn out the way you 
want them to.

1132
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,553
Structures of representation and modes 
of updating that structure of 

1133
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,414
representation.
So you can think about those as their 

1134
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,340
constants.
Some things you can predict,

1135
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:50,300
understand some things you can't,
that you can explore.

1136
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:55,330
You can be conventional and there is a 
characteristic nature of the domain that

1137
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:59,090
consists of things that you do not 
expect or desire.

1138
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:04,400
So the next hypothesis is those are the 
things that are represented in mythology

1139
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,850
and the reason they're represented is 
because there are constants.

1140
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,463
They're always there.
And so what mythology does it isn't 

1141
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:13,394
doing this.
This is just what happened is it lays 

1142
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:18,710
out these domains,
it attributes to them certain.

1143
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,120
And then it says on average,
here's how you should conceptualize them

1144
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,250
and deal with them.
And that's what stories are.

1145
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,840
So what I'll do next is I'll show you 
the symbolic realms.

1146
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,340
And then we can walk through how those 
are manifested in stories and you'll see

1147
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:40,170
that the stories all of a sudden become 
alive and that's really cool because the

1148
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:44,430
stories are really useful and not only 
are they useful,

1149
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,530
they're accurate,
they actually tell you what to do.

1150
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:51,890
So and things chaos in order.
Okay.

1151
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:53,763
That was to have them.
Order is where things that you want to 

1152
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:59,370
happens and chaos is where things you 
don't want to happen.

1153
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,190
And then the next thing,
broadly speaking,

1154
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:06,780
is the thing that mediates between those
and that would be your consciousness.

1155
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,303
And then there's a fourth category which
is a really weird category and it's the 

1156
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,950
category from which all those things 
emerge.

1157
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:17,550
So that's a really rough one to get your
head around.

1158
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,870
But it sort of something like this.

1159
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,513
There's unknown things that you can more
or less conceptualize and categorized 

1160
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,570
because they're not completely outside 
of your experience.

1161
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:32,910
And then there's the unknown as such.
It's sort of like raw potential and that

1162
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:33,744
potential,
the mythology conceptualized is that 

1163
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:38,790
potential as the fundamental bedrock of 
being.

1164
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,330
And it assumes that all those other 
phenomenon emerge out of it,

1165
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,660
so you emerge out of potential.
That's a perfectly reasonable way of,

1166
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,350
of thinking about the mythological 
representation.

1167
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,170
So we're going to lay those out in 
detail.

1168
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:53,004
I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories
using those categories and walk you 

1169
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:56,784
through it.
I'm going to tell you how those 

1170
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,900
mythological categories are constituted 
and what they mean.

1171
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,680
And then we're going to figure out how 
they need to relate to one another.

1172
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:08,670
And so good stories tell you how they 
relate to one another.

1173
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,310
That's what makes them good.
So,

1174
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:12,144
and you know that because otherwise you 
wouldn't know the difference between a 

1175
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:16,110
good story in a bad story.
So that's what's coming up.

1176
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,200
And so hopefully I won't have to go over
what we went over today again,

1177
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,034
but I really need you to get this first 
part clear because otherwise when we go 

1178
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:26,760
to the next stage,
it will make any sense at all.

1179
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,530
So okay,
go ahead.
