1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay.
So we're going to continue to be with

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:08,700
our initial exploration of different
ways to see the world.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,490
And so the last time I talked to you a
little bit about,

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,063
um,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,850
perceptions of what you might describe
as action orientation.

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,370
So the case I made for you with
something like this,

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:26,371
that there's two significant patterns of
facts in the sense that you need to know

8
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,880
about the world and one has to do with
the object,

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,920
the reality of things.
And the other has to do with how you

10
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,910
configure your behavior in the face of
that objective reality.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,560
And those two overlap to some degree,
but a lot of what scientists would

12
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:46,561
normally consider subjective experiences
are part of the domain that is

13
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,330
applicable to how you comport yourself
or how you act,

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,700
not the moral domain.
Um,

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,480
because psychology,
especially in its clinical

16
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:59,260
manifestations,
is concerned with how people should act,

17
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,880
which is in part mental health and how
they should perceive.

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,080
And even experimental psychology to some
degree is concerned with

19
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:09,920
psychopathology.
It's necessary to account for the

20
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:14,280
subjective and also for values as you
move forward in your investigation of,

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,870
of psychology,
personality psychology or clinical

22
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:17,704
psychology.
So,

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,193
MMM,

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,010
I want to,
we,

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,560
we started last week talking a little
bit about mythological representations,

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,280
um,
which I think of as the precursor to a

27
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:35,090
lot of the clinical theories that we're
going to cover today.

28
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:38,720
I want to go into that in a little bit
more detail and with a little bit more

29
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:42,830
specificity because I want to talk to
you about shamanic initiations and other

30
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:47,270
rights of initiation because it's
appeared to me for a long time and this

31
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,730
is,
this is something that has also been

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,940
observed by psychoanalytic thinkers,
that there are a

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,880
relevant and important points of
similarity between these archaic rituals

34
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,810
and the sorts of things that people
undergo in psychotherapy.

35
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,480
So I can give you a brief example and
then we'll,

36
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:09,314
we'll,
we'll,

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,630
we'll consider this in more detail.

38
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,003
Okay.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,010
People learn almost everything they
learned that's important in the face of

40
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,760
fear.
And although that's slightly more pests,

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,330
pessimistic viewpoint than it might be
because you can optimize that.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,410
The rate at which you expose yourself to
things that would otherwise cause you to

43
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,450
be afraid,
then they tend just to captivate you

44
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:36,100
would make you intensely interested.
So,

45
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,570
but as you're progressing through life,
what you're doing continually as either

46
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,250
at interacting with things that you
understand well,

47
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,030
which means that you know how to behave
in the face up or your interactions with

48
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:53,031
things that you don't understand at all.
And your body and your mind are prepared

49
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,560
to respond to things that you don't
understand it all.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,770
And they basically respond by putting
you on alert and being on alert is it

51
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:05,290
signed from your,
from the deep unconscious recesses of

52
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,291
your mind and your body for that matter
that you don't know what you're doing in

53
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,470
this particular space.

54
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,200
And as a consequence you have more
things to learn.

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,160
And so the way you learn when you're in
town or something that you don't

56
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:23,161
understand is by progressing voluntarily
into the space and time that's unknown.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,130
And so you're always learning as a
consequence of facing the unknown.

58
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,930
And the unknown is something that can be
frightening.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Although it can also be interesting if
you,

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,170
if you calibrate your exposure property.
Now this is just as true for

61
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,080
psychotherapy as it is for any other
form of learning.

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,320
And that's because psychotherapy really
is a form of guided and structured

63
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,680
learning.
One of the things that you continually

64
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:49,300
do with people who are seeking
psychotherapeutic health is to determine

65
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,540
what it is that they're afraid of or
what it is that they don't understand.

66
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,860
And then to break it down into what you
might describe as manageable doses and

67
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,120
then get people to expose themselves to
that situation or set of situations

68
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,080
voluntarily.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
And the consequence of that is that
people become less afraid and more able.

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,840
And the original hypothesis was that was
because you were doing some form of

71
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,590
counter conditioning that people have
learned to be afraid in a particular

72
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,470
circumstance and you were teaching them
to not be afraid.

73
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,400
That's wrong.
That viewpoint.

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,800
What you're really doing with people
when you expose them to situations that

75
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,220
they're afraid of or that they don't
understand is expanding the range of

76
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,100
competence,
and you either do that by literally

77
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,380
teaching them how to behave in those
circumstances,

78
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:37,381
which is what you would do with children
or maybe with friends or by helping them

79
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,980
observe their own reactions when they're
placed in a situation like that.

80
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,940
Because lots of people who are afraid of
things think that when they confront

81
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,390
something they're afraid of voluntarily,
that there'll be absolutely terrified

82
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:52,210
and unable to cope,
but they often find that if they do

83
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,210
place himself in a situation carefully
and voluntarily,

84
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,930
that they're nowhere near as paralyzed
by the encounter as they might've

85
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,320
thought.

86
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,670
And so art and what you're teaching them
then is that there's more to them than

87
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,530
they thought.
Generally,

88
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,320
when you're teaching people about the
world,

89
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,780
given that the world is a frightening
place,

90
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,620
if you're a psychotherapist,
there isn't a lot of utility in trying

91
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,490
to convince people that the world isn't
as dangerous as they think because the

92
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,770
world is just as dangerous as you think
it is.

93
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,160
It's actually quite a remarkable fact
that we're all not paralyzed with

94
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,590
anxiety all the time,
but what we're not.

95
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,700
But part of what you have in your
armament against the terrorism of the

96
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:35,701
world is the possibility that you hold
within you and people are unbelievably

97
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,070
tough and resourceful creatures.
And even if you think that you're not up

98
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,280
to the challenge,
you can be sure that encoded in your

99
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,940
bodily structures somewhere,
our abilities that you don't really

100
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,120
understand that would come to the
forefront if you put yourself in a

101
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,730
situation where they were necessary.
So,

102
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,400
and that's a lot of psychotherapy is
precisely that.

103
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,060
It's helping the person learn that
there's more to them and they fake not

104
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,890
so much that the world is less
frightening.

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,590
So
there

106
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,980
to be exposed to something you're afraid
of often means to reconfigure your own

107
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:14,620
preconceptions.
Because if you're afraid of something,

108
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,460
it usually means that you coded it or
understand it in a certain way.

109
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,880
And so that when you encounter it,
not only do you have to learn something

110
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,220
new,
but you also have to let go of your old

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,840
presuppositions.
Maybe that's what you do.

112
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:28,240
For example,
if you overcome some kind of prejudice

113
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:32,410
that you might have to,
to people or things or places because

114
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,080
you don't,
you don't approach the,

115
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,420
the,
the object that you're afraid of in a

116
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,850
conceptual vacuum and you have
presuppositions.

117
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:43,120
And what that also applies is that when
you're learning,

118
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,260
even when you're learning incrementally,
there's a process of letting go and a

119
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,900
process of building.
So when you learn something new,

120
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,390
you have to let go of an old
presupposition of some sort.

121
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,560
And those precept positions are alive
because they're part of view.

122
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,170
Part of what that means is that every,
every element of learning in the face of

123
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:06,280
something novel is often also an undoing
of previous learning.

124
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,080
And that's partly why the Motif of death
and rebirth is such a powerful one

125
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,730
through,
throughout human history.

126
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:15,380
It's a primary motive of human.
Um,

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,950
what would you call it,
of the human story.

128
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:22,951
It certainly of human mythology and the,
the experiences that people have in

129
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:27,940
psychotherapy are often similar to death
and rebirth experiences in part because

130
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:32,941
they come in damaged and fragmented and
hurt and often have to encounter even

131
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:37,090
more of the material that caused the
trouble to begin with.

132
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,950
But the consequence of that is that they
can shake the structures that are

133
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:45,400
inhibiting their further development
even though that might cause some pain

134
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,680
and then hopefully they can come back
alive.

135
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,000
And you know that when you encounter
something that's truly unknown,

136
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,400
you go through a process that's similar
to that too,

137
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,770
in that if you,
if you,

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,900
if you've ever been in a situation,
for example,

139
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:03,901
where you deeply desired something
but you failed to get it for one reason

140
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,490
or another,
there's a tremendous amount of pain

141
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,530
associated with that.
That could be a person or,

142
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,960
or a goal or a dream or something like
that.

143
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,480
It's extraordinarily painful not to be
able to attain a valued goal.

144
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:21,481
And the failure generally produces,
literally produces pain.

145
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,520
It's,
it's,

146
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,250
it's,
it's cognitive pain,

147
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,590
but many of the same pathways that are
involved.

148
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:30,130
And when you have to give up something
that you value,

149
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,360
you're giving up a part of yourself,
the part of yourself that's predicated

150
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,890
on that,
on that vision.

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,870
And not only is that painful,
but it can really throw you for a loop.

152
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,710
Um,
the phenomena that we're going to talk

153
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,420
about today are

154
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,030
representations of that process as well
as attempts to experiment with because

155
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,850
people have known for a very,
very long time that there was something

156
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:01,851
about partial death and rebirth that was
also akin to the revivification of the

157
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,610
human spirit.
And that's noise that human beings have

158
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,590
had for we really don't know how long
it,

159
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,130
certainly tens of thousands of years and
it might be longer than that.

160
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,590
So that's what we're going to talk about
today.

161
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,540
Now I'm going to back up a little bit
and clarify some of the things that we

162
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,650
talked about in the last class.
So I want to give you some sense of why

163
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:26,710
people see the world the way they do
because as,

164
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,750
as materialistic people.
And by that I mean people who are

165
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,220
embedded in a conceptual world whose
primary presupposition is that?

166
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:37,680
The fundamental mental level of reality
is material.

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,710
We have some misconceptions about our
own perceptions.

168
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,370
So for example,
for creatures like us who are alive and

169
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:47,550
who are primates,
the objective world isn't the primary

170
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:51,150
target of our perception.
The social world is the primary target

171
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,740
of our perception.
Now,

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,370
that's not so surprising.
Even if you examine your own behaviors.

173
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,270
So you might think,
how much time do you spend during the

174
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,150
day interacting with people in one form
or another?

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,980
If you include texting and emailing and
phoning and face to face conversation,

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,370
or if you're not interacting with them
directly,

177
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,450
you're thinking about them or you're
watching them or listening to them.

178
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,890
So maybe you're watching them in a
movie.

179
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,560
Are you watching them on tv or you know,
listening to them sing or you're

180
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,170
watching them perform.
The point is,

181
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:27,171
is that most of the world that confronts
us is the world of other human beings.

182
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,940
And the world of other human beings has
been around us evolutionarily ever since

183
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:36,420
there have been human beings and it's
very difficult to pinpoint.

184
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,570
The precise moment in time in human
beings came into existence.

185
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,500
But there were certainly vaguely human
like things 2 million years ago.

186
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,600
We seem to have split from the common
ancestors of chimpanzees 7 million years

187
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,750
ago.
So it's somewhere between two and 7

188
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,020
million years that we've been in an
environment that's primarily made up of

189
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,600
other people.
And then there's a great pre history

190
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:59,610
before that if tens of millions of
years,

191
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:03,990
where are the animals that surrounded us
word precisely human.

192
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,390
But they were certainly social and they
were primates.

193
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:11,391
And so even stretching that back past
far past when we,

194
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,340
we're human,
we lived in an environment that was

195
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,340
fundamentally characterized by social
interactions and what that,

196
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,260
what that means is that our brain is
essentially set up to perceive the world

197
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,510
through a Social Lens.
So here,

198
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,680
here's a,
here's a quote from a paper on private

199
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,680
social cognition.

200
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,980
How this is,
this is a group of researchers are

201
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,840
trying to understand,
uh,

202
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,800
the prodo linguistic representations.
I think with this paper of baboons,

203
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,010
cause the idea would be before human,
our human ancestors have language,

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,210
they have the perceptual structures in
the conceptual structures that were

205
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,800
linguistic light that that language
emerged out.

206
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,183
And,
and,

207
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,130
and the,
the understanding that we eventually

208
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,890
trends for,
to language was there and it's

209
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,160
prototypical form prior to our ability
to audit.

210
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,460
I can give you an example of that.
It's kind of a funny example.

211
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,880
You know,
how many of you know what to syndrome

212
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,040
is?
Yeah.

213
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,240
How many don't?
Okay.

214
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,750
Well Tourette's syndrome is a syndrome.
It's neurological syndrome that's

215
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,820
characterized,
oddly enough,

216
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,750
quite the propensity to curse.
And so it's very strange because you'd

217
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,120
wonder how in the world with a
neurological condition can make you

218
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,820
curse it.
Also people with and also move.

219
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,410
They have motor tics and so they,
they'll move in stereotyped fashions

220
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:32,950
and,
and,

221
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,500
and they really can't control that.
So if they're concentrating on

222
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,750
something,
they can control their motor output.

223
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,320
But if their concentration wanes,
then they're often possessed by fairly

224
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:45,970
complicated motor processes that sort of
run independently of their will as well

225
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,580
as these vocalizations.
Now you might think,

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,240
how in the world could you have a
neurological disorder that would make

227
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,190
you curse,
that would make you swear?

228
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,760
It just doesn't make sense in some sense
that your brain would be so fractionated

229
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:04,420
and it's specialization that you know
that a neurological condition could

230
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,950
emerge.
That was that specific.

231
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,840
But,
but here it seems to be the answer.

232
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,810
Um,
most curse words are very,

233
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:14,800
very short and kind of guttural.
And there are usually four letters as,

234
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,340
as in the famous four letter word.
And they're also usually expressed

235
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,020
during conditions of high emotion.

236
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,030
Now it turns out that certain kinds of
primates have distress calls.

237
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,280
So for example,
um,

238
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,530
perhaps there's a monkey troop and one
of its primary enemies are,

239
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,660
you know,
predatory birds that swooped down from

240
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:38,890
the sky.
And so the monkeys have evolved a cry

241
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,730
that basically means look out,
there's a,

242
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,310
there's an eagle in the sky that's going
to eat you.

243
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,360
And then once that cry is admitted by
any of any of the group members,

244
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,480
all of them immediately scatter and take
defensive action.

245
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,070
They high,
or maybe they have this,

246
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,250
it's another troupe and maybe they're
preyed on by leopards or something like

247
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,470
that.
And they also have an alarm pri for the

248
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,760
leopards.
And that means,

249
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,590
you know,
hit the trees or do whatever you have to

250
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,720
do to get away from the leopard.
Well,

251
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:09,040
it turns out that the linguistic centers
that are in those monkeys that produced

252
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,170
the alarm,
Christ of predators are the same

253
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,000
circuits that you use to curse.

254
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,260
And if you have tourette syndrome,
what happens is it's those old crow

255
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:21,310
linguistic circuits that you share with
lower order primates that are

256
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,090
disinhibited.
And so you can see a good example there

257
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:30,010
of a pro prototypic language structure
because monkeys are complicated enough

258
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,870
to be able to say something like,
Holy Shit,

259
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,460
there's a Jaguar.
And it's usually the most nervous monkey

260
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,660
in the path who's always jittery ground
on hyper alert,

261
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,400
who manages to curse out of warranty.
And so,

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,710
so anyways,
you have this protocol.

263
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:48,310
Linguistic is underlying prodo
linguistic capability.

264
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,200
That's,
that's,

265
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,980
that's at least part perceptual and so
we know,

266
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,390
for example,
that primates,

267
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,090
and this is true for animals that are
way less sophisticated,

268
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:59,120
the primates are very good at social
cognition,

269
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,500
so they know,
they know to the individual exactly what

270
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,430
strata the other members of their group
occupy can imagine they're in a dominant

271
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,060
Sarky,
right?

272
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,070
There's,
there's the,

273
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,980
the talk primates in the bottom primates
and then there's strategy primates all

274
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,440
the way up.
Just like there is in most animals and

275
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,820
primates are unbelievably good at
knowing who's who and they need to be.

276
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,860
Because if you've messed with the high
order primate up,

277
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,040
the dominants arc and you're sorta
lowly,

278
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,870
you're going to get hurt and it's,
it's better to be lowly and know your

279
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,880
place,
or at least this is how animals manage

280
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,810
it than it is to get hurt.
Young males who are sort of climbing up

281
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,200
the heart hierarchy will often take an
awful lot of abuse trying to get to the,

282
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,890
to the peak.
But most animals in his social truth are

283
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:47,820
pretty much resigned to their locale
because it's safer to be there.

284
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,930
And often the casts,
so to speak,

285
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,360
in the primate hierarchy are actually
hereditary.

286
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,470
So generation to generation,
the same family,

287
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,250
so to speak,
occupied the same rungs.

288
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,920
So one of the things we know about
social cognition is that,

289
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,940
and and human cognition is,
is that it involves social processing

290
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,070
and that it's also very much focused on
status.

291
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,350
There's some very funny studies of this
sort of thing.

292
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,020
I think one was done with mechanics,
if I remembered correctly,

293
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,560
where they'd show me the cacs
photographs of other mechanics from

294
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,720
their troop.
And those photographs are either have

295
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,890
low status mcats or of high status sort
of celebrity mechanics.

296
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,660
And the mechanics would spend much
longer time gazing at the high status

297
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,090
celebrity mechanics than like the low
people,

298
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,490
creatures,
whatever have you that they,

299
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,170
you know,
had nothing but contempt for.

300
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,400
So you can think a lot of our
preexisting,

301
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,520
perceptual and conceptual categories are
social,

302
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,920
so we're always processing other
creatures.

303
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,350
Humans for sure,
but other living creatures as well.

304
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,940
And we're also very concerned with who's
doing what to who and when and who's got

305
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,530
the power because it turns out that
dominance hierarchy status for example,

306
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,320
is unbelievably important in
determining,

307
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,620
well reproductive opportunities in
particular,

308
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:05,621
but also also general health and access
to prime access to resources.

309
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,730
Unbelievably important.
The internal representations of language

310
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,850
meaning evolve partly from our pre
linguistic ancestor's knowledge of

311
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:18,410
social relations member and when we tell
stories or listened to stories,

312
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,910
they're always about social relations.
So all the time like modern monkeys and

313
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,340
apes are ancestors,
lived in groups,

314
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,310
intricate networks of relationships that
were similar caneously competitive and

315
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,350
cooperative.
The demands of social life,

316
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:33,470
creating selective pressures for just
the kind of complex,

317
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:36,470
abstract,
conceptual and computational abilities

318
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,470
that are likely to have proceeded.
The earliest forms of linguistic

319
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,920
communication.
Although baboons have concepts and

320
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,440
acquire propositional information from
other animals,

321
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,560
vocalizations,
they cannot articulate this information.

322
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,840
They understand dominants relations and
matrilineal kinship,

323
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,170
but have no words for them.
This suggests that the internal

324
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,430
representation of Benny concepts,
relations and action sequences does not

325
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,760
require language and the language did
not evolve because it was uniquely

326
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,230
suited to representing thought.

327
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,330
Well,
you know,

328
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,140
as I mentioned to you in the last class
or maybe the previous class,

329
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,330
not only do monkeys,
baboons say,

330
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:15,360
what's your very complex?
Not only are they able to track

331
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,620
dominance hierarchy structures without
language like the lobsters are able to

332
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,290
do it.
So you can be very,

333
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,390
you can be very,
very sure that the underlying basis for

334
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:29,391
the linguistic representation of social
interactions is it's deep beyond belief

335
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:34,050
since we share it with crustaceans.
So it's very useful to know this because

336
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,450
it,
it also helps understand why certain

337
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,520
things have to intrinsic meaning,
you know,

338
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:42,030
like the dominance hierarchy and the
position in the dominants hurricane,

339
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:46,020
the relative status of preachers isn't
intrinsically meaningful piece of

340
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:50,100
information to us because it's an
important determinant of our survival

341
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:53,970
and reproductive opportunities.
So the meeting is there.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
You don't have to learn it.
You just have to figure out what to map

343
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:59,700
it onto and that,
that means that that kind of meaning

344
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,900
status related meeting is art.
It's built into you as a,

345
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,970
as,
as the ground of understanding.

346
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,960
So then I'll show you something.
Hopefully this'll work.

347
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,423
Um,

348
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,280
be a miracle for work.

349
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,161
Yeah.
Okay.

350
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,780
So this,
watch this.

351
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,923
Okay.

352
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,600
So we'll watch it one more time.

353
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,303
Okay.

354
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,970
Okay.
So anybody willing to hazard a guess

355
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,410
about what was happening there?

356
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,063
Yeah,

357
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,520
it was an attack.
That's,

358
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,270
that's one hypothesis.
Yes.

359
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,591
Anyone else?
Let's,

360
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:58,270
let's look at the players once again.
Well,

361
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,450
so the poor little pink circle is
trapped and then it's trying to get out

362
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,370
and when it does get out the big gray
triangles,

363
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,800
shepherds in the way,
but that irritates the blue triangle,

364
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,090
which he shepherds it back into the box
and the gray triangle isn't able to

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,780
answer something like that.
You can tell a story about it.

366
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,870
Does that,
I don't know,

367
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,620
like I'm not saying that's the canonical
interpretation of the triangles behavior

368
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,690
or any of that.
But you would agree,

369
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:23,020
I presumed that that's a reasonably
plausible interpretation of what those

370
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,880
triangles and circles were up to you.
Yes.

371
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,320
Okay.
Well No,

372
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:28,060
right cause they're triangles and
circles.

373
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,420
But the point is,
the point is,

374
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,810
is that our,
our ability to perceive social

375
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,811
interactions is so deep that we can take
entities that are only living in so far

376
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,860
as they're moving in certain ways.
And we immediately attribute like

377
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,540
motivation to tell a little story about,
and we can also agree on the story.

378
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,030
Now you could say,
well it was sort of built in by the

379
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,520
people who made the little animated
demonstration but,

380
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,730
but that,
that doesn't matter because the point is

381
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,730
they were able to build it in without,
with,

382
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,560
with virtually no representation
whatsoever.

383
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,670
It communicate it because they,
they knew that we understand that sort

384
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,230
of information.
So,

385
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,323
okay.

386
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,670
All right.
So let's push our luck and see if this

387
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:17,504
works.

388
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,800
Well,
you get the basic idea.

389
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:55,100
So
there's a couple of things that are

390
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:59,300
interesting about that clip.
One is everything's animated.

391
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,300
Everything has a life.
And that's actually okay.

392
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,490
You can watch that and you understand
it,

393
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,730
which is quite strange because of course
generally trees don't dance around and

394
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,564
so forth,
but,

395
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,540
but,
but the,

396
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,520
the,
this module that we have,

397
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:15,580
so to speak,
it's badly of describing it because

398
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:19,290
it's,
it's more like an entire mode.

399
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,240
It's the entire mode of human perception
has been called the hyperactive agency

400
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:27,380
detector by people who are somewhat
skeptical about its operation.

401
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,630
But,
um,

402
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,170
because we're evolved to exist within
living environments,

403
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,790
it's very living,
dynamic,

404
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,840
animal oriented environments.
It's very easy for us to see everything

405
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,270
in that way.
Everything is alive,

406
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,970
a priority.
And that's why when you're reading

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,860
stories to your kids,
like Thomas,

408
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:47,400
the tank engine has,
you know,

409
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:51,230
what personality and motivations and so
does the little engine that could and

410
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,850
all of these things that,
that,

411
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,410
that are used to represent to children,
ways of interacting in the world.

412
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,630
So,
all right.

413
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,960
So the,
the point of all this basically is that

414
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:07,961
we've evolved to categorize the world
into social categories and the social

415
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:12,440
categories that we use
or that use us.

416
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,450
That's,
that's a more accurate way of looking at

417
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,090
it because these are tools that we
voluntarily use.

418
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,910
These are ways that we perceive the
world.

419
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,370
They're underneath our understanding,
their preconditions for our

420
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:27,371
understanding.
So we tend to parse up the world into

421
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,860
personified categories.
And I didn't even say that property

422
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,210
exactly because that implies that you're
projecting something onto the world.

423
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,170
This personification.
It's deeper than that.

424
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,390
It's that the world appears to you
naturally end up in a,

425
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,500
in a living and animated manner.
And the reason for that is because most

426
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,750
of what you process,
and this was certainly the case

427
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,430
in to a great degree before human beings
became technologically proficient

428
00:24:57,591 --> 00:25:00,410
because we weren't that good at
manipulating the objective world at all.

429
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,410
Everything that we thought about,
everything we did essentially was

430
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,010
dependent on other creatures.
And so what that also means is that

431
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,550
whatever advances we've made in
understanding the objective material

432
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:15,551
world we've made by,
by with a tremendous amount of effort,

433
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,030
removing that tendency to see things in
an animated way from our collective

434
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,280
perception and,
and working diligently to come to terms

435
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:32,570
with the fact that there are ways of
treating certain phenomenon that aren't

436
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:34,430
animated,
that work better.

437
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,080
It's very,
very difficult for us.

438
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:37,670
And that's why,
for example,

439
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:42,020
we really didn't come up with a science
based technology until about 500 years

440
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,090
ago.
We really had to work against our own

441
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:47,840
instincts and we still done the
tremendous damage because to the degree

442
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:51,860
that we now perceive the world as
objective and material and sort of dead

443
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,570
in a sense,
it's also,

444
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,200
it's also being deprived of meaning and
people really suffer for that,

445
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,510
you know,
because motor people can certainly say,

446
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,060
given our understanding of both the
nature of reality,

447
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,450
is it reasonable to propose that
anything truly has meaning?

448
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,810
That's a very difficult question.
I would say don't give up on a too,

449
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,250
too quickly.
Okay,

450
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,830
so here is,
here's some natural categories of

451
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:16,520
apprehension.
So there's the dominants Archi,

452
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,350
that's for sure.
And that's the social group.

453
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,690
That's actually what union called the
animus.

454
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,580
Leaping ahead a little bit to the,
to the,

455
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,890
to the young new portion of this.
Um,

456
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,990
of these lectures,
the,

457
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,950
the,
the,

458
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,370
the dominance hierarchy is basically
what modern social constructionists

459
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,880
called patriarchy.
And it's often symbolized by an adult

460
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:40,400
male.
And that can have two aspects,

461
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:44,430
positive or negative because you know,
you're the of your culture and you're

462
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,410
also a victim,
so to speak.

463
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,580
It preys on you and pushes on you and
shapes you and molds even takes taxes

464
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,860
from you and finds you.
It doesn't let you do things.

465
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,990
But on another hand,
here you are in this university and

466
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,250
you're not starving to death and you can
all communicate and it's pretty painful.

467
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,570
So you know,
there's,

468
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,090
there's the great father,
so to speak,

469
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,240
bifurcated into two elements.
Pause to the negative.

470
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,230
And I told you the other day that that
was a little cirrus and that's who he

471
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:14,660
represented for Egyptian mythology.
He sorta standing on a pillar and a

472
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,670
representation to the right,
which is kind of an odd Christian

473
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,950
representation.
You have gone too far there in the

474
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,680
middle.
He sort of encapsulated inside Mary and

475
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,150
he's holding a figure of Christ and
everyone in the thing open to say

476
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,810
everyone on the doors to sorta looking
at Christ.

477
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,850
Um,
so there's the father in the middle

478
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,880
there and the father.
In the middle there is and on this side

479
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:40,881
you have what's essentially the son,
son and sun at the same time.

480
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,430
That's horace there and it's priced
there.

481
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,520
There's equivalent figures,
another religious and puzzled logical

482
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:50,880
systems.
And then on the right you have isis and

483
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:54,840
isis is related to Mary,
especially in this image because Mary is

484
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:59,820
basically portrayed there as the mother
nature that incorporates culture,

485
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,170
that's holding the individual.

486
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,850
It's a brilliant representation.
Most of them are.

487
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,850
The one on the right is a spectacular
representation because it sums up the

488
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:13,851
existential situation of human beings in
one sculpture and that is that well all

489
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:20,160
around us is nature and nature gives and
takes away and nature gives rise to

490
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:24,180
culture and culture supports us and
while it supports us we suffer and

491
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,290
hopefully we suffer and can manage it.
And that's why everyone is gazing at the

492
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,260
figure in the middle,
who's basically accepted the

493
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,310
inevitability and necessity of his own
death as a precondition for life.

494
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,420
So it's an amazing representation under
brilliant,

495
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,200
brilliant work of art.
A lot of that west elaboration of these

496
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:46,290
earlier Egyptian ideas.
There's awful lot of similarities

497
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,510
between the mythological representations
of horace,

498
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,340
for example,
and of Christ.

499
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:52,400
Here parallels are many,
um,

500
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,090
that makes people often cynical about
say the claims of Christianity.

501
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,870
But that's foolish as far as I'm
concerned,

502
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:01,410
because what both of these
representational systems,

503
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,330
0.2 is something deeper,
way deeper way underneath both of them

504
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,460
manifests itself in many forms.

505
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,753
So,

506
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,260
so this is the persona fine
representation.

507
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,770
So Mother Nature,
father culture,

508
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:23,020
and the individual.
Okay,

509
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:26,550
so now imagine that that's sort of your
primary as a crime made.

510
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:29,170
Who's striving towards linguistic
representation.

511
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,110
That's kind of what you've got to work
with as far as you're concerned.

512
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,020
That's the primal structure of the
cosmos.

513
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,180
So there's you,
that's the individual.

514
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,840
There's your mother and nature,
there's your father and culture,

515
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,820
and you are,
that's what the rates,

516
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,890
and that's what you've got to work with
to begin with.

517
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,040
Okay?
Now you know what?

518
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,490
Evolution is a conservative process.
And so what that means is that it's not

519
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,120
a radical renovated.
Usually what evolution does is cobble

520
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,250
something new onto something old.
Well,

521
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,080
the oldest conserve.
So for example,

522
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:04,081
you have mechanisms way down in your,
in your neurological systems that enable

523
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,660
you to do things like detects snakes
with an incredible rapidity and jump out

524
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,110
of the way it goes.

525
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,090
Or reflexes,
same reflexes,

526
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,930
similar reflections that are operative.
Say when you put your hand on a hot

527
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,240
stove and jerking away before you even
know it's hot.

528
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,540
So the reason you have,
the reason you can do that is because

529
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,690
your body has conserved incredibly
primitive neurological loops say will be

530
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,690
jerk your hand away from the stove that
only run from your hand to your spinal

531
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,940
cord and back.
So they're super fast,

532
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,560
but you know,
they can't do much.

533
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:33,970
They can jerk your hand away,
which,

534
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,500
which is enough.
If it's burning,

535
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,420
it's like it's a good thing to have
conserved.

536
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
So human beings as they evolve,
cognitively started out with this social

537
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:47,590
cognitive architecture that,
that they interpreted the world through.

538
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,600
And you can see why this would be partly
because,

539
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,150
well,
we do live in intensely social

540
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,280
environment.
There's always been mothers,

541
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,670
there's always been farther.

542
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,890
And then you add to that the human fact
that we have this unbelievably long

543
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,930
developmental period where we're
incapable,

544
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,220
fundamentally and capable of taking care
of ourselves.

545
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,180
Right?
So you know,

546
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,910
when something like that a moose calf is
born,

547
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,330
it's like three minutes later it's
wandering around in a full shows up.

548
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:13,791
Can,
you know,

549
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,440
it can run beside it's mother.
It's like human baby just lays there for

550
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:19,570
like a year,
you know?

551
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,030
And part of that is because it's,
you may not know this,

552
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,750
but for a mammal of our size,
we should have a gestation period of two

553
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,290
years.
So when those of you who are women have

554
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,800
children in the future and you know at
nine months you're pretty damn sick of

555
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,130
this,
you might well thank the structure of

556
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:38,290
the cosmos that you don't have,
you know,

557
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,850
15 more months to go because that's how
long the baby should remain in utero.

558
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,480
The reason it doesn't is because its
head grows too fast because we have this

559
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:50,170
big brain and so there's this weird
evolutionary arms race between the

560
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:53,890
mother's body and the pelvic girdle and
the head size of the infant.

561
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:58,150
And the way that's all sorted itself out
is women's hips are still narrow enough

562
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:00,490
so they could run,
cause if they were any wider,

563
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:05,260
they'd have a hard time running and the
baby is born at nine months instead of

564
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:09,700
24 with the compressible head because
baby's skull bones aren't put together.

565
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:11,830
And so when they pass through the birth
canal,

566
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,590
their head can be crushed and quite a
lot so that,

567
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,600
you know,
hopefully they live.

568
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,520
So anyways,
we have this incredible period of

569
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:25,090
dependency after that.
It's abject dependency for the first

570
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:26,650
while.
But then you're really not,

571
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,310
I don't know how long it takes people to
really get up and going.

572
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,650
It's like,
well 18 we'll say,

573
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,640
but of course that's complete rubbish.
It's more like 30 so there's a very long

574
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,820
dependency period and so that's all the
more reason why we would tend to view

575
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:42,690
the world as you know,
mother,

576
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:46,640
her father and then expand that owns
into our conception of the cosmos and

577
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,650
cure here seems to be how people did it.
So it's complicated association to

578
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:54,890
manage.
But I think the best way of managing it

579
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,740
is to think of the figure of Mother
Nature and that that would be narrow

580
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,690
here with the Isis.
They're now,

581
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:03,770
nature is a funny thing because I don't
want you to think about nature of the

582
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,110
way that modern people think about
nature.

583
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,640
I want you to think about nature as that
which lurks outside of culture.

584
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,420
So imagining the typical
tribal scene or let's say in the typical

585
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:21,581
rather primeval a village or gathering,
there's a domain that people inhabit

586
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,870
that they're sort of comfortable with.

587
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,140
That's where all the people are.
That's where the dominance hierarchy is.

588
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,460
And then that sort of surrounded by God
only knows what,

589
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,800
like the outside world,
the barbarians,

590
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,130
the darkness that eats the sun when it
goes down at night,

591
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,750
all the things that are foreign and
uncomfortable or outside of that circle.

592
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:45,440
And that's nature.
What's outside of culture is nature.

593
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,340
And so nature is the unknown.
And then what's inside is culture.

594
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:52,760
That's the known.
And that's actually turns out to be

595
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,490
weirdly enough,
even though it's a worldview that's

596
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,280
predicated on its underlying social
cognitive structure,

597
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,750
it turns out to be a worldview that's
unbelievably useful because it happens

598
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:07,250
to map onto the structure of subjective
experience extremely well in that

599
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,560
wherever you go,
you're viewing the world through a

600
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:16,250
cultural lens and you're usually
encapsulated in a culture as well.

601
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,790
You virtually,
it's virtually impossible now to go

602
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,520
anywhere where culture isn't with you
and around you.

603
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,060
I mean you can do it from time to time,
but even if you manage that,

604
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,480
it's still inside you in,
in,

605
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,320
in.
It's,

606
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,153
it's,
it's,

607
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,950
it's coated in the way that you behave
and it's structured the way you perceive

608
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:38,240
things and think about them.
So even if the outside world is devoid

609
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,610
of cultural artifacts,
doesn't matter cause you're a cultural

610
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,520
artifact right to your court.
Despite that.

611
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,540
And it's the incorporation of the
culture that allows you to maneuver and

612
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,090
live and act and do that somewhat
successfully.

613
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,050
Despite that,
despite that you're enculturated and

614
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:58,070
embedded in culture.
Nature can pop up and disturb you pretty

615
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:01,430
much at any moment.
And that happens when whatever it is

616
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:06,431
that you're doing doesn't work.
And so the way that that humanity

617
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:12,611
naturally perceives the world and
symbolizes the world is as a place

618
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:16,730
that's basically composed of culture and
culture is where you are when things are

619
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,400
going according to how you want them to
go.

620
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,860
That's sort of the definition of
knowing,

621
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:22,921
right?
It's,

622
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,540
it's not knowing a set of facts,
it's knowing how to behave so that the

623
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,950
ends that you're pursuing get acquired.
And that's more important in many ways

624
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,210
that knowing facts,
facts may help you do that.

625
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,470
But they been,
they may not too.

626
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,220
So there's,
there's,

627
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,740
there's the place you are when you know
what you're doing and you get what you

628
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:43,650
want.
And then there's that other place that

629
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:47,160
parks up all the time where you haven't
got a clue about what to do.

630
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,630
And that's the place that it's like a
transcendent place and that's nature.

631
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,900
And the Trans seven places where all the
mysteries of life comes from,

632
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,390
the things that you cannot handle,
the diseases,

633
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,710
the illnesses,
dad,

634
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,840
disappointments,
frustrations,

635
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,710
all the things that knock you for a loop
and make you tumble underground.

636
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,090
And that's nature.

637
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,380
Nature,
like a predator.

638
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,150
And it's a strange place nature because
on the one hand it gives,

639
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,640
because nature is the source of all
things,

640
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,350
given that it's the source of all new
things,

641
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:20,310
but on other hand it takes away because,
because it surrounds you if,

642
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,610
because it transcends your knowledge,
it's eventually what,

643
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,400
what kills you.
So people have a very ambivalent

644
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,580
relationship with nature.
Andy and Andy with nature because of

645
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,120
it's because of it's bifurcated and
paradoxical

646
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,780
existence.
Culture's the same way.

647
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,960
I mean in formal logic,
a thing can't be one thing and it's

648
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,500
opposite at the same time.
And these mythological categories that

649
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,830
are derivatives of social cognition,
things are what they are in their

650
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,190
opposites at the same time,
just as you're a beneficiary or a victim

651
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:56,370
of culture and a beneficiary and a
victim of nature.

652
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,290
So now the reason,
part of the reason I'm telling you this

653
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,920
is because it's very complicated to
grasp,

654
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,950
but what's what's happened with you
neurologically in part?

655
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,540
Is that the part of your brain that that
evolved to deal with things like

656
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,580
predators and dangers.
You know,

657
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:18,780
things that are emanating from nature
that would directly threatened you once

658
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:22,020
those things became abstracted so that
they could handle,

659
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,250
became sophisticated enough so that they
can handle abstractions instead of

660
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:28,740
dealing with things like Predator,
a,

661
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,950
Predator,
b or Predator,

662
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:31,920
see your dangerous situation.
A,

663
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,520
they got sophisticated enough to deal
with the class of those things.

664
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,020
And so human beings,
instead of perceiving a dangerous animal

665
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:43,860
or a dangerous place,
started to be able to perceive danger as

666
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,790
such and to conceptualize danger as a
class of events.

667
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,600
But the same circuits that were
originate that originated to do things

668
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,920
like take care of,
you know,

669
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:55,920
to make sure that you knew where the
snakes were coming from are also the

670
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:00,921
circuits that now enable you to
conceptualize danger in the abstract and

671
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:01,771
to,
you know,

672
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,160
to deal with it one way or another.
Potential future danger,

673
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,460
danger.
Now the fact of danger as an existential

674
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:11,220
reality,
all of that only human beings can

675
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:16,221
conceptualize the class of all dangerous
things and part of that's associated

676
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:18,024
with nature.

677
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,783
So,

678
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,670
so there's the,
there's the domain of nature outside the

679
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,830
domain of culture.
It's like an ocean surrounding an

680
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:30,990
island.
And then there's you standing on an

681
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:34,740
island islands nice and secure.
It's a very standard mythological

682
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,110
representation of the cause was by the
way,

683
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,900
there's culture and there's nature and
there's you,

684
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,070
and that's the,
that's the architectural situation of

685
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:48,220
the human being.
And that's essentially our reality.

686
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,100
And it's,
it's a reality.

687
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,500
It's not merely objected because it's so
tied up with life and with other people

688
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:59,610
and with their own essential being.
Here are some,

689
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,150
now we can,
we can move from the sort of underlying

690
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,120
domains of nature of the unknown
culture,

691
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:09,760
the known and the individual.
And then we can start to put some

692
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:14,140
symbolic flesh on those bones.
And this'll help us when we get into

693
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,190
discussions of psychoanalytic theory
because the analytical psychologists

694
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,980
like yoga and the psychoanalysts like
Freud was very,

695
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:24,700
very interested in the images that were
produced by what they regarded as the

696
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:25,630
unconscious mind.

697
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,160
Now,
your most direct contact with those

698
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,260
sorts of images would come from two
sources.

699
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,160
One would be your dreams,
and the other would be the stories that

700
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:39,010
you're exposed to,
both ancient and new,

701
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,770
because those stories are full of
mythological motifs.

702
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,240
I mean,
it's very weird.

703
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,950
You know,
in recent years,

704
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,510
the most expensive artifacts that human
beings produce virtually maybe with the

705
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:54,280
exception of plants that fabricate chips
are movies,

706
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,160
visual representations of mythological
themes.

707
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,530
So for example,
the marvel movies,

708
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,110
iron man and those sorts of movies in
the avenger,

709
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,440
those are among the most expensive
things that people have ever created.

710
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,001
And you know,
when you say,

711
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:09,460
well there's,
there's obviously a profit motive

712
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,570
underlying that.
Well,

713
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,320
he,
yeah,

714
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,110
it's not a very intelligent analysis.
The point is,

715
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,890
is that people are still devoting a
staggering amount of effort to

716
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,740
representations like that.
And everybody goes and watches the,

717
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
so just for an example,
you know,

718
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,630
um,
in the avengers movie,

719
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,540
there's all,
I can name half a dozen mythological

720
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,210
motifs that,
that are embedded in that.

721
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,340
So for example,
iron man is nell chemical symbol cause

722
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,200
he's,
he's turning into gold and iron turns

723
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,380
into gold as far as the agent alchemists
are concerned.

724
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:44,110
That's part of its moral progression
towards perfection.

725
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,870
And his suit represents that cause it's
gold even though he's in the iron man,

726
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,870
he's also ICARUS,
right?

727
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,720
Remember,
ICARUS flies too close to the sun and

728
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,430
then plummets to earth.
So of course,

729
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,550
um,
iron man does that when he's in

730
00:40:56,551 --> 00:41:01,300
countering the thermonuclear explosion
that eventually wipes out the,

731
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,910
you know,
the demonic aliens that are pouring

732
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,950
through the portal in,
in time.

733
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,960
So in the thor movies,
that's a hostile brothers motifs.

734
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,670
So there's thor and Loki that's like
kate enable or Christ.

735
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,690
And Satan's the same motif and it's
representative of the sort of eternal

736
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:21,691
battle between good and even evil that's
going on in the background of human

737
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,340
consciousness and like it's on and on
and on.

738
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,370
These movies portray these symbolic
realities for us and we're so hungry for

739
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:32,980
them that will line up and pay to watch
them.

740
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,210
It's very strange if you think about it,
you know,

741
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,910
there's,
there's not many forms of activity that

742
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,620
you will do that for.
You know,

743
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,750
and they're very informative,
those movies.

744
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,850
But you know,
you don't generally line up and pay for

745
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,350
lectures,
movies,

746
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,880
man,
you'll go to those for fun.

747
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,310
It's like,
it's very strange behavior,

748
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,650
especially when you look at what the
things are represented.

749
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,000
Everything that Medieval Christians for
example,

750
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,140
you know,
got exposed to in the Catholic Church

751
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,670
and in the mythology that went along
with that.

752
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:05,560
We go to movies and see,
so the movies set up the same way at

753
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,251
churches,
right?

754
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:11,210
There's seed rows and rows of seats and
all of a mythological actions at the

755
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:15,020
front and it's bright and there's music
and it's exactly the same thing.

756
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,320
So here's some symbolic equivalents.
And the reason you might think of a

757
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,210
symbol as something that represents
something else,

758
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:25,950
but that's not exactly the right way to
think about it.

759
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,800
These symbols in this sense are elements
of this domain.

760
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,520
So they're,
the domain encompasses a tremendous

761
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:37,460
number of phenomenon,
and these are some of the phenomena.

762
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:40,640
So there's nature nature's the
unconscious.

763
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,331
Why?
Well,

764
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:43,790
it's beyond you,
your unconscious mind.

765
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,280
That's not you,
that's nature inside you.

766
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,890
It does what it wants.
It'll do all sorts of things.

767
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,200
You don't want it to want what don't
want it to do,

768
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,000
and there isn't much you can do about
it.

769
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,150
And all you have to do is notice all the
stupid things you've done in the last

770
00:42:56,151 --> 00:43:00,140
six months to understand to what degree
you're in the grip of the unconscious.

771
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,660
You know,
maybe you fall in love with someone and

772
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:03,920
you don't even like the,
I mean,

773
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:05,150
what the hell is up with that?

774
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,140
And there's nothing you can do about it.
You'll act like a moron.

775
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:11,420
Just like everybody,
every human being who's ever lived,

776
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,670
acted like a moron when that happen to
them.

777
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,570
So you're gripped by the darkness.
That's nature too.

778
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,890
That's what lurks outside the campfire.
It's like the terrible things that prey

779
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,730
on the unwary and of course that's true.
That's why it's not just symbolic.

780
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,720
He's things aren't just symbolic.
There are monsters.

781
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,060
You know,
parents will tell their children when

782
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:33,680
they have a dream,
while there's no such thing as a

783
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:34,431
monster.
It's like,

784
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:36,800
and then you know,
then they'll tell them not to ever

785
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,980
approach a stranger on the street
because God only knows what will happen.

786
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:43,730
It's like those two things do not go
together.

787
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,530
They're either monsters are,
there aren't.

788
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,110
People are so damn afraid of them still
that you know,

789
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,980
they torture their children to death
with,

790
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,520
with,
with threats,

791
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,250
with,
with the idea of threats that don't even

792
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:57,160
exist.
Like the probability that a given

793
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,420
challenge could be abducted by a
stranger is so close to zero that you

794
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:02,870
know,
you might as well not even bother

795
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:05,440
thinking about it.
It's almost always a,

796
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,640
you know,
a divorced parent that comes along and

797
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:10,890
grabs them and runs off with that,
you know,

798
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,350
well it's a custody if it's a custody
dispute issue.

799
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,560
Most of the time,
hardly anybody gets abducted by

800
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,510
strangers.
Why would they want your child?

801
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,740
Nature has dark.
This other element too,

802
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:26,630
which,
which you sort of hear about it at a

803
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,630
funeral where its ashes to ashes and
dust to dust,

804
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:31,440
right?
Nature is the thing you emerge out of

805
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,480
like poof,
there you are.

806
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,370
You're born and you weren't around
before and then you know 50 60 70 years

807
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,680
give or take a decade.
You're going again.

808
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,020
What did you come out of and where do
you go?

809
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,420
Well that's nature from a symbolic
perspective too.

810
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,750
It's out of nothing.
You come in back to nothing.

811
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:52,170
You go and it makes absolutely no sense,
but it doesn't matter because that's

812
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:56,280
what happens.
So that sort of nature as as the

813
00:44:56,281 --> 00:45:00,120
unconscious and the devour and then
there's the great mother,

814
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,740
the Queen,
the Matrix,

815
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,050
the matrix,
the container,

816
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,270
the Cornucopia.
You know what a Cornucopia is.

817
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,340
It's one of those things that you see at
Thanksgiving.

818
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,650
We're thing,
it's got this point at one end and it

819
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,070
opens up into a kind of a big circle.
It looks like a horn.

820
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:16,470
It's made out of wicker.
And things pour out of it.

821
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,380
It's like what is that thing?
Well,

822
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:19,861
it's,
it's,

823
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:22,080
it's,
it's a Cornucopia and it's a,

824
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,000
it's a representation of the,
of the portal in a sense that everything

825
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:29,370
flows out of.
So you can think about it in some ways.

826
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:32,250
You ever watch those time lapse
photographs of a flower opening?

827
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,290
Of course he have,
you know how it sort of comes out of

828
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,860
nowhere and manifests itself.
That's what the Cornucopia is a

829
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:42,210
representation of the place from which
all new forms constantly emerge.

830
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,060
And that's what you're supposed to be
thankful for it Thanksgiving and you

831
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,870
should be thankful for it.
It's a pretty be a pretty dismal world

832
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,570
effects start happening.
And then there's this,

833
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:54,600
the object to be fertilized,
the source of all things that he come to

834
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,500
the pregnant,
that,

835
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,830
that kind of helps explain why the,
it's the,

836
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,270
it's the representation of the feminine
that was used to represent the unknown

837
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:07,740
because I'm now known as the place that
all new forms emerge from and that makes

838
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,350
it fundamentally feminine.
So

839
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,690
that's one domain of
unconscious symbolism.

840
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,090
Things get assimilated to this too.
So,

841
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,600
for example,
the strangers part of the unknown,

842
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,330
strange idea can be part of the unknown,
the emotional.

843
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,910
And that's because emotion overtakes
you.

844
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,910
You know you're at a movie and all of a
sudden poof,

845
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,700
you dissolve in tears.
It's like it wells up from,

846
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,720
from where?
From from the unknown interior and

847
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,640
possesses you.
And at the same time it does with

848
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,690
everyone else in the movie or you know
everyone else who's tuned in,

849
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:50,090
who has some feelings.
So other representations of the same

850
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,690
domain,
the foreigner as a person who comes from

851
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:57,300
foreign lands because they're
contaminated with things you don't

852
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,460
understand.
And sometimes that can be terrible

853
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:00,990
because the thing they're contaminated
with,

854
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,130
especially in human,
in the dark recesses of human history,

855
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,130
the illnesses,
I mean God only knows where the great

856
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,890
plague comes from,
but we know that it came on ships.

857
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,030
And so people left Italy because that's
where the plague seemed to first

858
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,320
manifest itself.
They laughed,

859
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,450
they went somewhere,
picked up some new rats,

860
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:19,830
came home,
we'd like poof.

861
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,490
A third of Europe was dead.
It was even worse when the Europeans

862
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:24,690
went to the new world.
Right?

863
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:28,880
Because as soon as the new world datas
shook hands with the,

864
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,560
it was like bang,
95% of them died in the next 50 years.

865
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,040
So the idea that the foreigner is
contaminated with the unknown,

866
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,470
that's a nontrivial Ikea.
And if it isn't,

867
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,350
you know the pathogens they carry that
it's the damn I,

868
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:44,860
he is to come sneaking into your culture
and just blow it into bits over,

869
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,440
you know,
a fair number of decades is something to

870
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,790
be terrified of.
You know,

871
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,270
by the same token,
there's incalculable wealth has been

872
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:56,710
generated culturally and materially as a
consequence of the intermingling of

873
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:59,500
human beings from all over the world.
So it's another one of those situations

874
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,290
where it gives with one hand and it
takes with the other

875
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,410
hell death and the grave

876
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,413
mood

877
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,980
ruler of the ninth and the mysterious
dark matter,

878
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,750
matter matrix,
mother,

879
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,840
same root words and the earth mother
earth.

880
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,360
So those are all those,
those,

881
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:23,320
all those,
all those images are related to the same

882
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,220
under underlying well of meaning and
not.

883
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,250
That's a representation of that which is
always beyond you from which all new

884
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:34,600
things coming to which all things
return.

885
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,790
That's the unknown.

886
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,660
Artists are very good at representing
this sort of thing.

887
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:46,760
This is quite nasty.
So these are your basic,

888
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,050
you know,
hell like monsters devour written other

889
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:53,120
monsters,
which maybe I could actually be a good

890
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:56,560
thing.
So that's,

891
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,000
that's,
that's a representation in some sense of

892
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,890
the war of everything against
everything.

893
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,770
You know,
the old idea about nature being red in

894
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:07,430
tooth and claw and everything,
devouring everything else to keep to

895
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:09,980
keep existing.
And a representation too of the sort of

896
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,260
pain is phrase that goes along with a
life of,

897
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,120
it's even quite peaceful.
Nature's a vicious place and,

898
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,250
and you have to contend with it and you
don't know what it's up to you.

899
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,040
And it's virtually impossible to keep up
with it in,

900
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,240
in Alice,
in wonderland,

901
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,580
Mother Nature's there and that's the red
queen,

902
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,940
the Red Queen.
And she's the one who's always yelling

903
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:31,070
off with their heads when they're trying
to play croquet.

904
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:31,791
It's like,
really,

905
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:33,620
you know,
that just doesn't seem civilized.

906
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:34,454
And,
and,

907
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,870
and it's,
it's,

908
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,510
it's the red queen who sows to Ellis in
my kingdom.

909
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:41,690
You have to run as fast as you can and
just to stay in the same place.

910
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,440
That's a good definition of life because
nature is always transforming.

911
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,540
This is Kelly is not the devour,
it's a Hindu representation and a,

912
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,330
well she's quite the character as you
can see.

913
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,610
Um,
I can tell you a little bit about the

914
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:02,030
image in the middle so that you've kind
of have some sense of what this,

915
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,730
like religious images are often trying
to represent

916
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,660
these fundamental realities that I've
been describing,

917
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,720
these underlying structures of
perception and cognition.

918
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:16,430
So Kelly hears it's kind of thing.
She's a representation of all the things

919
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:20,060
that you should run away from screaming,
which is a good category.

920
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:22,250
It's like the category of monsters and
horror.

921
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,670
And so let's investigate her.
So first of all,

922
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,020
she's a spider.
That's,

923
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,340
she has eight lanes.
You know,

924
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,370
people don't like spiders much cause
they were trying to poison us and they

925
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,450
web,
we're spin webs and capture the unwary

926
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:36,910
and then devour though.
So,

927
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,560
so she didn't this web fire,
that's the kind of call them on the arch

928
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,150
rounder and the fire is full of skulls.

929
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,980
You can see the skull,
it's inside the fire.

930
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,040
So it's like,
uh,

931
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,580
it's like a web of flaming skulls.
You know,

932
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,500
it doesn't get more awful than that.
Read it.

933
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,560
And then her hair's on fire and she
wears a headdress of stalls.

934
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:03,830
And then she's brought a few weapons in
case you're not already terrified.

935
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,650
And then she,
she often has the tongue of a tiger of,

936
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,800
oh,
I don't know if she does it,

937
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,170
match the image.
And then often there's a snake wrapped

938
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:14,960
around your waist.
But in this case it's not a snake.

939
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:18,320
You see those sort of coyly things
around your belly to belly and sunken.

940
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,250
That's cause she'd just be burst to the
guy that's two standard and she's

941
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:25,160
devouring inviting a test sites.
So that's Kelly.

942
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,140
And it's a representation of everything
you really don't want to mess with.

943
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,260
And you should be very,
very careful about if you make the

944
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:36,470
proper sacrifices to Kelly,
well then maybe she'll show you her

945
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,140
benevolence side.
And that would be a really good thing.

946
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,020
And you know,
people have been making sacrifices to

947
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:44,930
God's forever and God to try to get them
to stop,

948
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,793
you know,

949
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,430
okay.

950
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,860
Doing this sort of thing.
And you know,

951
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,250
it's very easy for modern people to
think about that as a superstition,

952
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:56,040
but it's not a superstition.
It's one of the most fundamental

953
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,880
discoveries of mankind.
And the discovery was if you let go of

954
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:04,260
something that you value now,
maybe you'll get something better in the

955
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:06,270
future.
It's like that is that,

956
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,600
that's the discovery of time.
It's,

957
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,480
it's a phenomenal,
it's a phenomenal achievement.

958
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:15,720
And human beings are the only people who
discovered it consciously.

959
00:52:15,721 --> 00:52:17,940
Like bees make honey and they store it
up for the winter,

960
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:20,160
but probably they don't know what
they're up to.

961
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:25,161
But human beings can understand that a
terrible fate might confront you,

962
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,560
but if you make the right sacrifices
now,

963
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,730
you'll propitiate faith and you'll,
you'll survive and thrive into the

964
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,570
future.
And that's why you're all here at

965
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:38,700
university instead of while I'm,
I presume you did a real shortage of

966
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:40,380
partying,
but at least you're not doing it right

967
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:41,910
now.
You know,

968
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:46,290
you're making sacrifices to be here.
And the idea is that if you sacrifice

969
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,490
your valuable time,
the time of your youth now that the

970
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:54,470
fates will smile on you in the future
and then you know you,

971
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,100
if you would,
didn't believe that you wouldn't be

972
00:52:56,101 --> 00:52:59,130
here.
So you believe it and you act it out.

973
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:02,940
Do you understand it psychologically and
conceptually and archaic people

974
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:05,340
understood it practically and
dramatically,

975
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:08,910
but it was the same thing.
You better make sacrifices and hope that

976
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:11,730
you can turn this into it's benevolent
counterpart.

977
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,810
Well then there's culture.
This is another domain of symbols.

978
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,270
It's a,
it's a very attractive domain of symbols

979
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:24,590
mean to the degree that you,
you're an Aficionado of a sports team.

980
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,090
You're,
you're tangled up by your,

981
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,010
your symbolic longing for a place within
a culture.

982
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:36,240
And it's,
it's so tied up with your psychological

983
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:38,910
being that you will act like the team is
you.

984
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,970
In fact,
one of the weird things about human

985
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:46,950
beings is that they'll often celebrate
the victories of their heroes or their

986
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:50,370
teams more intensely than they would
ever celebrate anything that ever

987
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,690
happened to them.
I mean,

988
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,390
how often do you see people at work,
you know,

989
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,440
throw their hands up in the air and then
run out in the hallways and dance around

990
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,600
because something good has happened?
It's like it never happens,

991
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,420
but if it's a football game or a hockey
game,

992
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,070
people will paint up their faces.

993
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,070
And when there's a goal sport,
which is a symbolic act two,

994
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:09,420
right?
Because you know,

995
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,570
human beings like to hit the target.
There's a sexual element to that,

996
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:17,060
but there's also an element of hunting
and there's an element of specifying

997
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,810
your target and achieving it,
you know,

998
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,210
and doing that cooperatively with all
the other people on your team

999
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,570
competitively in relationship to the
other team.

1000
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,390
It's real little microcosm.
The point is,

1001
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:31,530
is the symbolic elements of that'll grab
you just like you're a primitive

1002
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:34,170
tribesman and you won't even notice.
You'll think,

1003
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,760
oh,
I'm just having a party because my team

1004
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:36,390
won.
It's like,

1005
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,220
yes,
you are some cute your creatures.

1006
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,440
So you know,
all the teams they have their,

1007
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,630
their,
their tribal logo is essentially,

1008
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:46,560
you know,
and,

1009
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,420
and all the iconography that goes with
it.

1010
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:51,510
And they're treated almost as if they're
sacred objects by people who are the

1011
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:52,344
fans.

1012
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,570
You know,
they'll go look at the Silver Cup and

1013
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:56,550
they're happy as it comes to their town.
It's like,

1014
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,480
don't be thinking you're not
superstitious,

1015
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,060
you know,
it's just that our modern superstitions

1016
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:05,370
are invisible to us and we don't notice
they're there.

1017
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:07,920
It's like you're superstitious,
right to the court.

1018
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,160
And human beings have always feed
culture,

1019
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,920
superego,
Freud's categories,

1020
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,240
id,
ego,

1021
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,700
superego,
map quite nicely onto nature,

1022
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,060
individual coaching.
So that's kind of interesting.

1023
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,060
Became the patriarch,
the plow,

1024
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:26,160
the Thalos order and authority and
tradition.

1025
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,260
The wise old man and the tyrant dogma,
the day skype because it's illuminated,

1026
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,100
it's illuminated.
The day skies is masculine,

1027
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,370
it's symbolic nature.
Your country,

1028
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,020
your brother,
the iron,

1029
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,760
the heights,
and assess ancestral spirits and

1030
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:46,770
activity of the dead
to the degree that you're patriotic.

1031
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,580
No,
you're possessed by the symbolism of

1032
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,530
culture and the symbolism of the known
you.

1033
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:54,510
You would regard that as a virtue,
right?

1034
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,950
Well,
what's more important to you?

1035
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,730
Your own being or your family or your
own being or your family or your

1036
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,890
culture,
which is more you?

1037
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,980
Well,
it's not obvious and depending on the

1038
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:06,690
situation,
people make different decisions.

1039
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:08,820
As soon as it's war time,
everybody says,

1040
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:11,070
oh,
my culture is more important than me off

1041
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:11,821
they march.
You know,

1042
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:14,640
even if it's world war one,
all they're marching to his,

1043
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,500
you know,
continual death.

1044
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,830
There's no,
you're gripped by these things in ways

1045
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:21,930
that you just cannot understand.

1046
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,680
Captain Hook,
he's a great representation of the

1047
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,930
negative element of culture.
So Hook,

1048
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,360
why does he have a hook?
Where does captive vocab,

1049
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,510
the hooker
crocodile bit it off.

1050
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,490
Right?
And what does the crocodile having its

1051
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:47,491
stomach and what does that mean tide?
So what's bit old captain Hook's handle

1052
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,100
off time is chasing him around.
It's going to take them under.

1053
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,190
It's already got a taste of him.
And so he's terrified of that.

1054
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,360
So he's an adult male,
right?

1055
00:56:58,361 --> 00:56:59,920
He's terrified of that.
He's a tyrant.

1056
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,070
He's already lost a hand to time.
Now that damn crocodile,

1057
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,580
that's that horrible Serpentini thing
that lives underneath the depths.

1058
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,730
First chance it gets it going to take
the rest of these terrified about that.

1059
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,000
It makes them into a tyrant.
Peter Pan looks at him.

1060
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,610
He's the only adult being around.
Fundamentally.

1061
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:19,330
He thinks there's no damn way I'm going
to be a tyrant who is chased by the

1062
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:22,840
crocodile of time.
I'm going to stay a little boy forever.

1063
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,330
That doesn't work so well.
Right?

1064
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:27,880
Cause the only gets this tinkerbell who
doesn't even exist and he has to let

1065
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:30,730
Wendy go off and be real.
You know,

1066
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,890
it's,
it's an eternal story of not growing up

1067
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:36,970
in the face of tyranny.
It's a story that won't go either.

1068
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,610
And it's a story that people act out
like you wouldn't believe.

1069
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:41,270
Okay.

1070
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,740
Well,
and then there's the old man in the

1071
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:43,311
talk,
right?

1072
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:45,230
That's Stellan by the way,
that he's kissing.

1073
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:46,670
I mean,
really think about that.

1074
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,840
Stellan probably killed somewhere
between 30 and 60 million people.

1075
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,150
That's a lot of people.
But nevertheless,

1076
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,490
it's old man.
It's so gripped by what he represents.

1077
00:57:55,491 --> 00:57:59,740
It is sort of gold wisdom that misses
after the wall fell down that he,

1078
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,240
you know,
he can't stop himself from worshiping

1079
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:04,520
this thing that was so barbaric that
they're like,

1080
00:58:04,521 --> 00:58:08,060
it defies description.
The good old days you have.

1081
00:58:08,061 --> 00:58:11,150
Well they weren't so good.
That's a good representation of stuff.

1082
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,210
That's for sure.
A terrible element of culture.

1083
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,490
And that's patriotism gone wrong.

1084
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,130
Stella.
Yes.

1085
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,030
Everybody's family favorite.
I really liked the one on the right's

1086
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,520
cause he sort of,
he's like the devil standing in the

1087
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:32,450
flames of
love because it's very,

1088
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:34,960
very accurate.
Yeah.

1089
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,020
Stellan following Lennon,

1090
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,830
that was quite a pair.

1091
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,730
Then there's Hitler,
you know,

1092
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:47,240
all the 20th century's other
manifestation of the horrible face of

1093
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:48,074
culture

1094
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,790
versus who is able to produce mass
hysteria is fall over.

1095
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,350
He's the one who,
who represented for them everything that

1096
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,570
was noble about so called area and
culture.

1097
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:03,610
All of that was the consequence like
nature can do but so can culture and

1098
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:06,550
that's why you know your proclivity to
identify with things,

1099
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:10,480
to identify with groups and to identify
with states to identify with cultures.

1100
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:14,020
It's like the greatest gift you have
cause it makes you civilized and

1101
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,840
cooperative.
But it's also one of the most horrible

1102
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:18,920
things about you because if it's an
activated property,

1103
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,940
there's nothing more dangerous than you.
Well I told you about this but we'll go

1104
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:37,860
over just briefly again cause it's very
important.

1105
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:40,950
So this is the dallas symbol.
That symbol is dob.

1106
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,970
Dow essentially means meaning,
but it also means the way it means a

1107
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:48,420
bunch of things.
And Dow for the Dallas does what things

1108
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:49,470
are made up.
It's what?

1109
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,420
It's the underlying reality of things.
And for the Dallas that's more meaning

1110
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:57,590
than it is like material or in some
other way you could think about this is

1111
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,820
more like information than it is like
material.

1112
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,750
And so the Dallas think that

1113
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,540
that that

1114
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,260
experience,
you can't say reality because it's not

1115
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:11,950
the same conception.
That experience is meaningful and that

1116
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:16,120
the meeting is the primary reality and
the meaning differentiates itself as an

1117
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:20,920
emergence and it differentiates itself
first and to masculine and feminine

1118
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:25,600
essentially into the structure that you
use to perceive reality.

1119
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,870
That's culture and what it is that
you're perceiving.

1120
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,040
And that's nature and that it's a lovely
conception.

1121
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,010
It's different than the way people look
at the world in the modern world,

1122
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:37,780
but it's,
it's,

1123
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:42,730
it's parallel and I think it's,
if not more useful,

1124
01:00:42,731 --> 01:00:47,731
it's certainly equally useful because it
helps you understand and articulate

1125
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,970
elements of your own experience that
can't be understood from a framework

1126
01:00:54,971 --> 01:00:56,470
that has a different underlying
structure.

1127
01:00:56,471 --> 01:00:59,380
So you know that sometimes you're
comfortable that things are going well

1128
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:03,310
for you and you know that sometimes all
hell's broken loose and you fall through

1129
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,580
the ice and you're dazed and confused
and maybe you won't get up again.

1130
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:10,300
And you know that those are two
different places and that you'd rather

1131
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:13,960
be in the former than the latter.
And you also know that there's certain

1132
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:18,550
ways that you should act to make sure
that you stay where it's comfortable and

1133
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:23,170
interesting rather than wandering off to
where it's like terrible beyond belief.

1134
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,230
Not You could call that in some sense,
your innate sense of morality.

1135
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,363
It's,
it's a,

1136
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,140
it's a,
it's a kind of intelligence,

1137
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:33,970
but it's deeper than that.
And as I said in the other class,

1138
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,410
the other thing that's lovely about the
dallas interpretation is that it's the

1139
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:42,220
interplay between these two things that
constantly brings reality forth.

1140
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,790
And then if you balance the property,
which is the aim of a property,

1141
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,950
religious life from the Dallas
perspective,

1142
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,670
then you have all the benefits of what
you understand and what you are and what

1143
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:53,440
you're familiar with order.

1144
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,950
And then you have the excitement of
having one foot in not unknown.

1145
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,580
And it's a perfect place for human
beings to be because not only do we want

1146
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:04,690
to stay with what we are and conserve it
if it's good,

1147
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,170
but we want to continually transform it
so that it gets better and better and

1148
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:10,960
better.
So I can give you an example of this.

1149
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,580
I'll give you two quick examples and
you'll,

1150
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:15,820
you'll understand what I mean.
So imagine you're watching a gymnastics

1151
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:18,070
performance,
two of them and the first performer

1152
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:18,904
comes out.
It's like the,

1153
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,390
and the fruit.
The first performer comes out,

1154
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,060
man,
this person is like perfect.

1155
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,660
You can tell they expect $10,000 cause
that's what you need to master.

1156
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:32,661
Something like working on these routines
and every single movement they make is

1157
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,260
impeccable and the routine goes on for a
few minutes and then it ends in the

1158
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:37,891
person's,
you know,

1159
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,740
they're triumphant about it and
everybody claps.

1160
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,830
And the judges are all like 9.9 out of
town.

1161
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,920
And people are pretty happy about that.
And so that's,

1162
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,550
we're all hooked into that because we've
seen someone demonstrate mastery.

1163
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,030
And so we're thrilled about that because
it shows that that's what a human being

1164
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:55,560
can do.
And we're human beings too.

1165
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:56,251
And so,
you know,

1166
01:02:56,251 --> 01:03:00,510
Yay for us.
So then the next candidate comes out and

1167
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:04,710
they've got a real problem because of
course what they have to face and

1168
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:07,230
overcome his perfection itself.
If you might take,

1169
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,850
well,
how in the world could you possibly do

1170
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,400
that?
And so they get out there and this

1171
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:14,340
performance is different.
It's got everybody on the edge of their

1172
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:17,010
seats because they watched that person
go through.

1173
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:20,310
They're absolutely perfect routine,
but they had one twist to it.

1174
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,570
They push it so hard that you can tell
by watching them that every single

1175
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:28,110
second of the performance,
they're like this close to disaster.

1176
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,400
So they've taken their perfection and
they pushed it to the point where well

1177
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,340
they're well,
they're competing,

1178
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,010
they're improving themselves,
they're taking that risk.

1179
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:41,970
And that's the sort of phenomena that
makes everybody in the audience go

1180
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,420
absolutely dead quiet cause everyone's
on their edge of their seat thinking,

1181
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,700
oh my God,
is this gonna work?

1182
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,320
Is this going to work?
Are they going to pull it off?

1183
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,870
And so no,
people are holding their breath and

1184
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:52,411
they're,
they're,

1185
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,190
they're tied right into it.
And then that person ends and you know,

1186
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:58,830
they do their little tram foot landing
and everybody's on their feet,

1187
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:01,500
rory.
And that's because they just saw someone

1188
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,510
do this perfect mastery plus they pushed
themselves beyond that.

1189
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,900
And so that's the proper way to play a
game.

1190
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,120
You're not just playing it,
but while you're playing it,

1191
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,890
you're improving your ability to play
it.

1192
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,793
Okay,

1193
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:24,310
here's a representation of that medieval
representation.

1194
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:29,460
Here's the known and here's the explorer
pushing his head out past the dome of

1195
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:33,100
the known for a long time.
That's what people thought reality was,

1196
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:35,380
right?
It was this desk that everyone lived in

1197
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:38,210
with this dome over top of it.
That's where the stars were.

1198
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:40,180
And that's because if you go out in the
field at night,

1199
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,660
well that's kind of what it looks like.
It looks like you're on a big desk with

1200
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:44,830
them.
Don't over talk with it.

1201
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,250
He's gone beyond that.
He's trying to understand what's outside

1202
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,240
the realm of his comprehension.
And that's what human beings are like.

1203
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,870
We're always poking her nose out past
our limitations,

1204
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,940
trying to ministers the things that we
haven't yet mastered,

1205
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:05,330
and there's real meaning.
And what's maybe that's the deepest

1206
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:10,190
meaning that you can experience in life
is that is the capacity to take to

1207
01:05:10,191 --> 01:05:13,310
master something inventive,
continually extend your mastery at the

1208
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:17,060
rate that you see fit at the rate that's
optimal for you.

1209
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,530
And then there's the opposite of that,
you know?

1210
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,840
So just as the great father has its
enemy,

1211
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,490
the tyrant and the break mother has its
enemy the divine hour,

1212
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,870
then the individual has a tendency,
and this is very interesting

1213
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:37,810
representation from ancient Egypt,
this is,

1214
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:42,730
and this is sick,
it's set is the Egyptian precursor to

1215
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:46,170
the later Christian idea of Satan in
this representation,

1216
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:50,520
it's good and evil that are,
this is like the tree of life here.

1217
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,710
And what they're doing is sort of
spinning it back and forth.

1218
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:58,030
And the idea here is that human
existence is a dynamic interaction

1219
01:05:58,031 --> 01:06:02,910
between these two forces,
one ending enlightenment and dried and

1220
01:06:02,911 --> 01:06:04,300
the other aiming at darkness.

1221
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,530
And that's what that represents to
except in this representation,

1222
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,540
it's the overcoming of the darkness
where that also happens in the Egyptian

1223
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,390
stories but not in that particular
representation.

1224
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,230
So you have the known or the unknown and
it's two elements,

1225
01:06:20,231 --> 01:06:22,840
negative and positive and you have the
known and it's two elements,

1226
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:25,760
negative and positive.
And then you have the individual and

1227
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,270
it's two elements,
negative and positive.

1228
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:33,280
And the interaction between those
categories makes up stories

1229
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:36,040
fundamentally.
And all the stories that you ever hear

1230
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:40,810
about how it is that you should live or
shouldn't live are different

1231
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,290
juxtapositions of those characters and
their interactions.

1232
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,440
And the more archetipal the story,
the more clearly the case that structure

1233
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:51,010
is.
So for example,

1234
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,570
in the thor movies,
Loki and thor are sons of zoots,

1235
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:57,790
right?
So Zeus is the great father and he

1236
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:02,050
produces hostile brothers.
And that's the same that's echoed in

1237
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,500
Christian stories by God and Christ and
Satan.

1238
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,450
It's the same idea and candidate when
you see these hostile brother patterns

1239
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,180
everywhere.
And that's because people have to

1240
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:17,470
contend with what opposes the orderly
outside in the world when they're

1241
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:21,700
contending against their opponents,
some of whom are corrupt and deceitful,

1242
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:26,701
but also within themselves when they're
trying to set themselves straight and to

1243
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,310
keep at bay,
all those elements of their own

1244
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:33,100
character that seemed to work at cross
purposes to themselves.

1245
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,380
It's a very strange thing about people,
you know,

1246
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:40,590
we can't just tell ourselves what to do
were inhabited by all these strange sub

1247
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,280
personalities that have a certain amount
of autonomy and they're off doing

1248
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:46,900
whatever they want to.
At any given time.

1249
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:48,880
And they're very difficult to bring
under control.

1250
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,430
It's very hard to be the master of your
own house.

1251
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:07,030
So I sub divided up reality for you in
one way.

1252
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,220
And so for the time being,
we're,

1253
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,450
we're done with that.
Now I want to sub divide reality up in

1254
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:19,451
another way because you can't understand
what's going on in the heroic and

1255
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:23,810
shamanic initiations and in the world
view that's encapsulated there

1256
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,300
and
the implication of that worldview for

1257
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,120
the understanding of phenomena like the
unconscious and the unconscious

1258
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:34,670
symbolism without looking at the world
from one other perspective.

1259
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:38,990
So here,
here's a decomposition of your computer,

1260
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:42,590
let's say.
So first of all we'll imagine your

1261
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:45,770
computer's working and so then you might
think,

1262
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:47,570
well what is your computer when it's
working?

1263
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,460
And then that's a hard question to ask
because it's while your keyboard,

1264
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,920
cause you're clicking on the keyboard in
all likelihood and then there's the

1265
01:08:55,921 --> 01:08:59,620
screen or there's what's on the screen
cause you're not actually looking at the

1266
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:00,710
screen,
right?

1267
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:03,500
You're looking at what's on the screen
and isn't even clear where that is.

1268
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,270
But the computer while you're using it
sort of collapses itself down into what

1269
01:09:08,271 --> 01:09:10,310
you're watching on the screen and what
you're interacting with.

1270
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,350
That's the computer.
And then all of a sudden,

1271
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:13,550
poof,
it stops working.

1272
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,890
So you have an emotional response to
that,

1273
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:17,750
right?
Like the monkey who's just seen a

1274
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:19,880
Jaguar,
it upsets you.

1275
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,390
And the reason it upsets you is because
you actually don't have a clue about

1276
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:25,760
your computer.
And it either works well,

1277
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,690
some of you more than others either
works and then it's a computer or it

1278
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:33,410
doesn't work,
in which case God only knows what it is

1279
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,530
or what you're going to do about it.
So this is,

1280
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,610
this is a good example of how what you
understand can collapse into what you

1281
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:43,220
don't understand because the computer
turns out to be an unbelievably

1282
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:47,390
complicated thing and it can fail for
innumerable reasons.

1283
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,230
And if you want to fix it,
then you have to take into account it's

1284
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,820
insane complexity and start to piece it
back together so that it starts to

1285
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:59,150
behave like the computer you want it to
be instead of like a,

1286
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,160
you know,
old,

1287
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,730
long oblong rock.
So what do you have to do?

1288
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,160
Well,
I represented the computers,

1289
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:12,161
that little black rectangle in the
middle and it's expanded it down one

1290
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:14,690
level.
So your computer's obviously full of

1291
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:19,700
subcomponents of all sorts boards and
chips and all the little things inside

1292
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:24,260
of the electronic things that all of
which when they work you can ignore,

1293
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,880
but when they don't work instantly
constitute a whole nest of snakes.

1294
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,430
And so any of those sub components could
have gone wrong.

1295
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,260
And then the sub components or me having
to even smaller parts of course in any

1296
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:37,190
of those could go wrong.

1297
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:41,440
And then underneath that there's the
element of properties that the mighty

1298
01:10:41,441 --> 01:10:43,520
parts have to contend with in order to
function.

1299
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,760
And sometimes,
well sometimes weird things happen down

1300
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:48,830
there.
So I don't know if you know this or not,

1301
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:53,831
but computer chips have now got so small
that there's only some probability that

1302
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,470
the electrons that are flowing along a
given wire,

1303
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:02,530
we'll actually be in that wire because
the uncertainty principle specifies that

1304
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:07,460
electron is probably here,
but it might also be somewhere else.

1305
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:12,530
And at small enough levels of resolution
or high enough levels of resolution that

1306
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:16,110
actually to become a problem.
So the electrodes can just get outside

1307
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:21,111
the wires and that causes shorts.
So probably your computer isn't failing

1308
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:24,510
because of some pathology at the quantum
level of reality.

1309
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:29,511
But you never know.
Micro part might be not working property

1310
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,480
component where you going to be working
property.

1311
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,070
Ah,
but there's other ways of,

1312
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,600
of the process of considering the
problem too.

1313
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,690
You might say,
this is the last time I ever buy a

1314
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:43,740
compaq computer and then what you're
doing is you're attributing because of

1315
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:46,380
its failure to act like a computer to
the brand.

1316
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,740
And then he might say,
well I bought one of those,

1317
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,490
I bought a computer from a,
from an economic system that's still

1318
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:55,410
somewhat pathological.
So you might say,

1319
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,420
well it's a Chinese part,
for example.

1320
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,010
And as a consequence,
the brand isn't reliable and the reason

1321
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:05,070
the brand isn't reliable is because the
economic system isn't reliable.

1322
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,320
And that's because the political system
isn't reliable.

1323
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:09,870
So maybe the reason your computer
doesn't function is because the

1324
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:13,440
political system that surrounds the
manufacturer doesn't function well.

1325
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,830
So he ended up with a cheap part and it
doesn't work.

1326
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:20,430
And so all of those,
as soon as your computer stocks being

1327
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:24,180
what it is to you,
which is the keyboard and the screen or

1328
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:26,880
what's behind the screen,
say that all of a sudden it turns into

1329
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:30,600
all these other things that it could be
in order to get it working like a

1330
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:34,860
computer again or even to replace it,
you have to contend with all of these

1331
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:36,420
other multiple levels of reality.

1332
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,620
So
there's two lessons from that.

1333
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:43,950
One is,
well that's why you get stressed when

1334
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:47,100
something stops working.
It's because when it's working,

1335
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,980
it's doing what you wanted to do and
that's what it is.

1336
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,550
The fact that it's doing what you want
it to do defines what it is.

1337
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,090
But as soon as it stops working,
God only knows what it is.

1338
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,770
You know,
cars are like that,

1339
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:02,340
except they're even worse because with a
computer you can usually just throw it

1340
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:03,570
away and replace it.
And you know,

1341
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:04,860
maybe that's a couple of hundred
dollars,

1342
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:07,140
but maybe something went wrong with your
car.

1343
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:11,640
Well that's a complete bloody
catastrophe because not only does it not

1344
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:13,650
function as a car and how it's just a
hunk of metal,

1345
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:18,060
but you have to take it to someone who
you don't know to fix it.

1346
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,300
And who knows what they're going to do
with it.

1347
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,370
Like they might fix it,
but they might not,

1348
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:25,560
or they might take something that
actually isn't wrong or they might

1349
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:26,430
overcharge.
You are,

1350
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,380
I mean,
there's a whole rat's nest that's

1351
01:13:28,381 --> 01:13:31,920
associated with having your car break
down and that tangles you write up.

1352
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,990
It's funny because as soon as the car
breaks down,

1353
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:37,800
then you have to contend with the whole
culture that surrounds the car and any

1354
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:39,900
of the,
all of the pathology that might be

1355
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:41,820
embedded in that culture.
Okay.

1356
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:45,790
So one way of thinking about this,
uh,

1357
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,440
computers like that manifests itself on
multiple levels simultaneously,

1358
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:52,830
but so do people and so to all other
phenomena will stick with people.

1359
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:55,470
For now,
you know there's a level at which you're

1360
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:59,430
phenomenologically a parent and that's
the level at which we all see each

1361
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:01,560
other.
I can see your front but not the back of

1362
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:02,490
you or the sides of you.

1363
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,920
And I can see your outside but not your
insight.

1364
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:08,820
And I can see you,
I can't see your family that surrounds

1365
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:11,040
you all the way.
If I was a chimpanzee and we were

1366
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,380
looking at each other and I knew you
were a high status chimpanzee,

1367
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,160
my body would detect your family because
I would know that if I messed with you,

1368
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:23,290
they'd come after.
And so I would perceive your nesting in

1369
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,730
the social group,
even though you don't,

1370
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:29,170
you'd sort of manifest yourself to me as
as just the body.

1371
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:31,030
But my,
my,

1372
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,520
my physiology would be smarter than
that.

1373
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:39,240
So
another way of thinking about the world

1374
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:44,140
is like this,
and this is a very old symbol as well.

1375
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:47,560
So this is like the tree of life.
So this is the Scandinavian tree of

1376
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:48,910
life,
which is called him,

1377
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:52,960
does Disneyland.
And then interestingly enough,

1378
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,710
there's a Peruvian tree of life from the
Amazonian jungle.

1379
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:01,120
So that's quite cool I would say,
because it goes what goes look

1380
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,510
remarkably similar,
right down to the fact that,

1381
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:08,710
see at the bottom here,
this is rooted in chaos.

1382
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,390
So down here maybe you can see there are
snakes and the snakes are eating the

1383
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:14,710
roots.
They're always doing that.

1384
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,520
But there's water down there and at the
same rate that the snakes eat the roots,

1385
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:22,360
the water makes the roots grow.
And so there's an idea that this whole

1386
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,840
multi level manifestation of reality is
grounded in that chaos that constantly

1387
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:32,320
renews itself and its Serpentine.
And then in the one next to it,

1388
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:37,030
you can see there's the mountain air,
like there isn't in this representation,

1389
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:39,200
but you see that big snake that's around
the mound,

1390
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,980
it's biting it's tail there.
That's called a neuro growth.

1391
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,320
So that's another indication of the idea
that order that's culture is surrounded

1392
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:49,710
by chaos.
Chaos is representative by that,

1393
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,540
that big snake.
And,

1394
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,090
and I think in this one,
there's a snake.

1395
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,290
There's a snake in the Scandinavian
world tree just like there is in the

1396
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,640
tree by the way.
In Genesis.

1397
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:01,810
Right?
So,

1398
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:06,900
and then there's this tree which is
being drawn by a woman named Angelica

1399
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,390
Gebhardt.
Sayer went to the Peruvian jungle and

1400
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:13,990
ask the showman there about their
visions of the world and drew this

1401
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,330
picture as a consequence of what they
told her.

1402
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:17,620
And what you notice is,
well,

1403
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:20,770
here's a tree and there's this big snake
surrounds it.

1404
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,760
And so that's an architectural idea.
And so archetypical that,

1405
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,790
you know,
the ancient scandinavians and the

1406
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,790
Peruvian Shaman in the middle of the
Amazonian rainforest can have the same

1407
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,370
vision.
And the vision of reality is associated

1408
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:36,070
with that multilevel idea that I just
told you about.

1409
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:38,410
You know,
how can the world be like a tree?

1410
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,320
Well,
the world is like a tree that sprouts up

1411
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:44,140
from,
from the tiniest places up into the,

1412
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:46,090
into the grandest areas.

1413
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,540
It's,
it has multiple levels of resolution.

1414
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,870
And that's what this represents.
And it's a really lovely way of thinking

1415
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:53,704
about things.
It's,

1416
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,370
it's not a way that we think about them
normally and,

1417
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,610
but it's relevant,
right?

1418
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:02,611
Because what you are isn't just what you
present phenomenologically which is what

1419
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:06,730
everyone else experiences.
It's all the microsystems that you're

1420
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:10,640
made up of that are invisible and that
can go wrong and it has to be diagnosed

1421
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:14,270
in fixed and then just like that you're
embedded in your families and your

1422
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:17,160
larger cultures and so on.
And if there's pathology there,

1423
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:22,330
there's pathology and you as well.
And so you are structured in this tree

1424
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:27,731
like matrix of interconnections right
from the subatomic level all the way up

1425
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,930
to the cosmic level.
It's all affecting you all

1426
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:35,000
simultaneously.
And this is a very nice way of

1427
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,560
representing that.

1428
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:41,690
I'll show you one more picture and then
we'll stop.

1429
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,730
My son drew this when he was eight and
he had a very well ordered psyche,

1430
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,700
which I was quite happy.
But look,

1431
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,541
let me,
let me show you.

1432
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,110
I never thought it was amazing when you
came [inaudible] you see my office.

1433
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:58,910
So first of all you have that's ordered.
Those are all mushroom houses for

1434
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:02,690
reasons I really don't understand.
And all of his friends live in those

1435
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:05,720
mushroom houses and they all have his
friend's name on them and they put out

1436
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:07,430
little fires cause kids always draw
that.

1437
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:09,050
He,
there's always a chimney with the fire.

1438
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:13,250
Who knows why.
So that's order.

1439
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:14,660
And then there's the line down the
middle,

1440
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:17,090
like the Yin and Yang line,
and then another side,

1441
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:18,860
here's nature and chaos,
right?

1442
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:22,310
And then the tree of life grows right in
the middle.

1443
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,840
So that's the sort of Jack in the
beanstalk tree of life,

1444
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,533
what's happening.

1445
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:29,150
You may see,
see there's a lady by the gear and then

1446
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:32,000
there's another lady bump on the vine
and I guess that's him.

1447
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,290
And he climbs up the tree of life in the
heaven because that's heaven up there

1448
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:39,290
and then climbs back down and with
information.

1449
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:43,490
And so what he's doing,
well he's barely order and chaos is

1450
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,520
climbing up and down.
We turn all the tree of life to the

1451
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,100
route of his ancestors and then coming
back.

1452
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,850
So amazing.
If you listen to kids dreams and if you

1453
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:54,980
watch what they draw,
you see them produce these sorts of

1454
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,540
architectural things all the time.
And it's,

1455
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,390
you know,
probably it's not exactly exactly

1456
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:00,740
instinctual,
right?

1457
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,080
It's like there's a matrix that has a
form that can be filled in by cultural

1458
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:06,831
content.
I mean,

1459
