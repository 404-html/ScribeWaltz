00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,000
So the first question that came up,
oh,

3
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,190
there's something I want to say first.
First,

4
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,070
thank you for tuning into this Q.
And.

5
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,200
A.
It's always much appreciated.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,953
Um,
it's a pleasure to do these and they 

7
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,170
seem to be quite popular.
It's been a while since I did one,

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,004
but I've been on the road a lot and away
from my computer and so that's the 

9
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:42,040
reason or the excuse take your pick.
Hopefully it's a reason.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,100
Um,
I wanted to let you know too,

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,353
those of you who don't know,
I have worked on two programs online 

12
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:53,410
that are hypothetically helpful to 
people.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,720
One is self authoring Dotcom and that 
helps you write about your past and your

14
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:01,230
present and your future,
um,

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,133
to catch you up.
That's the past authoring program to 

16
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:07,660
identify your faults and virtues.
That's the present authoring program.

17
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,494
And to make a vision and to counter 
vision for your future and to make an 

18
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,120
implementable plan.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,433
They're writing exercises.
I produced a 20% discount for all you q 

20
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,754
and a people today.
So if you use the discount code 

21
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:21,394
august@selfauthoring.com,
then you can purchase the full set of 

22
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:29,340
programs for 20% off and you have a 
tooth.

23
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,174
I,
we have a two for one offer so you can 

24
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:33,640
share that with a friend as well.
So,

25
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,474
and then understand myself.
Dot Com is a personality test site that 

26
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,344
enables you to get a big five readout of
your personality with each of the big 

27
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,480
five traits,
extroversion,

28
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,040
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

29
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:49,150
conscientiousness and openness broken 
down into their two aspects.

30
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:49,984
So you can get a pretty comprehensive 
view of your personality and that code 

31
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:53,674
is also August and that's in the 
description of the video in case you 

32
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,574
forget.
So,

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,290
um,
if you're inclined,

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,020
you can use those codes and you can try 
out those programs.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,600
We know the future authoring program,
for example,

36
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,930
if university students do it,
especially the ones that are struggling,

37
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,764
it produces quite a market increase in 
their propensity to stay at university 

38
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:13,990
and to get better grades.

39
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,930
So the program seemed very,
very effective.

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,760
So if you're trying to straighten out 
your life,

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,760
then I would recommend the self 
authoring program.

42
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,594
And if you're trying to understand 
yourself better or someone that you 

43
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,860
know,
then you could try understand myself.

44
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:30,340
Dot Com.
So that's that.

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,760
Um,
the other announcement I suppose is that

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,200
I've done a tour now of about 65 cities 
with tammy.

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,213
Somebody asked how she manages this.
She's exceptionally good at traveling 

48
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:42,904
and very low in neuroticism.
Thank God for that because it's been a 

49
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:50,260
stressful time with lots of opportunity 
obviously.

50
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:54,220
And she likes to travel and so she's 
very good at helping me manage this.

51
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,070
Um,
we're going to hit about 40 more cities,

52
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,940
40 or 50 more cities between now,
the end of April next year,

53
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,941
which is when I'm going to bring all 
this touring to a close in September and

54
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,844
early October.
We're doing 20 cities on the eastern 

55
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,170
seaboard of the United States.

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,550
And then in October,
near the end of October,

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,060
about 15 cities in the UK and northern 
Europe.

58
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,690
And then in February,
Australia and New Zealand.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,960
And then in April,
March and April,

60
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,460
then the rest of Europe,
um,

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,920
that's the plan anyways in perhaps 
there'll be some side trips during those

62
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,023
times to other places.
And so you can find out about 

63
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,510
that@jordanbpeterson.com forward slash 
events.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,490
You're more than welcome to come to the 
talks.

65
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,970
They've been very good events in my 
estimation.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
Um,
I've really enjoyed them.

67
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,533
I can tell you I enjoy doing those talks
and I find them a lot less stressful 

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,370
than talking to journalists.
The crowds are there,

69
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,413
the individuals in the crowds are there 
to come and listen to a serious 

70
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,670
discussion about how life might be 
improved and they're very,

71
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:09,070
very positive events.
So I've been very happy to do them.

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,700
The Sam Harris Videos,
I did four talks with Sam Harris.

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,740
Those are in preparation.
We hope we'll have them out in August.

74
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,574
Everybody's trying to come to an 
agreement about how they should be 

75
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,750
released.
It's rather complicated affair given how

76
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:26,230
many people are involved.
But I think we're close to figuring that

77
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,360
out.
Um,

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,610
there'll be 10 hours of tape talks for 
sessions,

79
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,220
two and a half hours each.
I think the talks were very,

80
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,230
very productive.
We'll see.

81
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,060
The audiences seem to,
um,

82
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,720
react positively to them and they were 
very well attended.

83
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,600
We had 8,500 people in Dublin,
so,

84
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,620
and about 6,500 in London.
So those were very large crowds.

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,873
So that's very cool.
12 rules for life has sold about 2 

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,583
million copies now.
And for those of you who are 

87
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,731
mathematically Geek inclined,
that's 57 miles of bookshelf.

88
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,740
If the books are stacked,
uh,

89
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,990
you know,
as you would put books on a bookshelf.

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,020
So that's a lot of books and maps of 
meaning.

91
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,710
I released the Audio version of that 
June 12th,

92
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,860
2018 and it hit,
did it hit the New York Times bestseller

93
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,861
list for audio books in July and August.
So that was rather comical given that 12

94
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,130
rules for life was never put on the New 
York Times bestseller list.

95
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,173
So I thought that was an ironic little 
touch of fate and I'm quite pleased to 

96
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,680
see how the audio book is doing.
If you like 12 rules for life and you're

97
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,190
looking for something that delves more 
deeply into the same themes,

98
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:39,820
then you could try maps of meaning.
And I think the audio book,

99
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:42,550
which I read is more accessible than the
written book.

100
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,843
Um,
people seem to be responding to it that 

101
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,054
way.
So I'm pretty happy about all the 

102
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,860
positive things that are happening.
Um,

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,100
so,
okay.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,290
How am I,
that's the first question.

105
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,770
How am I,
well,

106
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,383
pretty good.

107
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,853
Actually.
My health seems to have stabilized 

108
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,310
substantially.
I'm feeling pretty sharp.

109
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,200
Um,
I have periods of some negative mood,

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,940
although they're short and sweet,
uh,

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,310
so to speak.
But I'm seem to be sharp cognitively and

112
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,860
I can concentrate for long periods of 
time and get lots done.

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,920
I've been able to do quite a bit of 
writing in the last couple of months,

114
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,350
partly blog posts,
partly.

115
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,184
Also,
I had the privilege of being asked to 

116
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:32,180
write the introduction to the 50th 
anniversary version,

117
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,343
single volume,
abridged version of soldier Knutson's 

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,953
Gulag archipelago.
And I finished that about a week and a 

119
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,760
half ago that took me about two months 
to write,

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,760
um,
about 3,500 words,

121
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,594
if I remember correctly.
It was a daunting task to write an 

122
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:52,560
introduction to a book as tremendously 
influential and um,

123
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,103
and important and,
and also have exceedingly high literary 

124
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,474
quality.
So it was a daunting task to write that 

125
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,354
introduction.
And I really wanted to get it right and 

126
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,814
I hope I did.

127
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,070
I spoke by email with Solzhenitsyn's 
family and they seem pleased with it and

128
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:14,000
so did the editor and I've had a couple 
of editors including Gregg Hurwitz,

129
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:14,834
my novelist friend from
La who's an absolutely vicious editor 

130
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:24,320
and extremely good at it.
So they were happy with the final cut,

131
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,730
so to speak.
So was I.

132
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,200
So,
um,

133
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,320
I seem to be sharp enough to do the work
that's necessary to do.

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,260
I've been working hard on the online 
university.

135
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:37,010
I've got three people hired,
they're all very smart young guys.

136
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,303
Um,
and we're about a year ahead of where I 

137
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,264
thought we'd be at this point.
We hope to have a minimally viable 

138
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:48,221
product sometime in the late fall.
I'm funding that entirely at the moment,

139
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,560
courtesy primarily of my Patriot 
support.

140
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,170
So thank you to all my patrion 
supporters for that.

141
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,063
Hopefully your money's being put to good
use will probably crowdfunded in 

142
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,724
November to see if we can set up enough 
capital for the next three or four 

143
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,264
years.

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,220
Um,
I could raise money privately.

145
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,290
There's lots of people are interested in
investing,

146
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,290
but I think that I'm going to try 
crowdfunding because,

147
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,383
well,
because I'd like this to be a public 

148
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,130
enterprise from the beginning,
Dan,

149
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:14,964
to have lots of people involved and 
we're thinking of all sorts of ways of 

150
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,190
getting people involved.
How am I,

151
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:24,191
other than that?
Well nonplussed and still feeling rather

152
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,330
surreal about my life.
I would say.

153
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,330
Um,
my family is in good shape.

154
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,760
My daughter who was very ill is doing 
extremely,

155
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,594
extremely well.
So that's miraculous as far as I'm 

156
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,880
concerned.
My son's getting married in September,

157
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,020
that's Julian and I like his fiance.
Thank God for that.

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,570
And uh,
so we're looking forward to that.

159
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm going on a bit of a vacation during 
August,

160
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,463
which is the first time I've had off for
about two years with the exception of 

161
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:52,814
one week last year.
And I'm going to a family reunion and 

162
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,530
Vancouver Island and then to 
Saskatchewan to see my family.

163
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,080
We're going to do two talks in 
Saskatchewan while I'm there,

164
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,670
one in Saskatoon and one in Regina.
And I have a lot of family coming to the

165
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,504
one in Saskatoon.
So that and then a little reunion after 

166
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,170
that.
So that should be cool.

167
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
So,
um,

168
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,370
that's how I am and I'm thinking hard 
about the next book.

169
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,000
I have a new book contract about to be a
finalized,

170
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,660
I think in the next week.
I'm hoping to release the next book,

171
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,960
which will be 12 more rules.
Um,

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,913
probably,
uh,

173
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,813
uh,
beyond mere order is that tentative 

174
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,454
subtitle.
I'm hoping that I'll have it done by 

175
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,690
spring,
early,

176
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,780
early spring,
perhaps January of 2020,

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,033
if not one year later,
but I'm going to try hard to hit it so 

178
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:44,994
that I'm done by next September.
I'm going to write nonstop from May to 

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,393
September.
And then I plan to do biblical lectures 

180
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,164
from September through December.
So the plan is to tour from January 

181
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,250
through May,
essentially

182
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,580
then to write for four months then to 
lecture to prepare the biblical lectures

183
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,070
and so forth for four months.
And so that should be next year.

184
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,640
So that's an update.
Um,

185
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,090
hopefully that's all useful information.
Um,

186
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,030
I'm very pleased about all the support.
It's quite remarkable.

187
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,340
All this,
um,

188
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,030
interest in these complicated matters 
and complicated discussions.

189
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:26,864
And it's so nice to see people 
concentrating on psychological and 

190
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:35,051
philosophical issues and leaving the 
idiot politics as far behind as possible

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,370
because it's certainly a,
uh,

192
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,593
what would you call it,
a distraction and a dangerous one at 

193
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,134
that.
So it's so funny talking to the 

194
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,033
mainstream media types because 
everything they talk about has to be 

195
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:52,910
viewed through a political lens.
Although I continue to insist,

196
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,390
I did BBC hard talk,
which was aired today,

197
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,224
and that was a classic example of an 
interviewer being entirely scripted and 

198
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,590
trying to push everything that's 
happening around me,

199
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,573
I suppose into a political narrative.
And it isn't political as far as I'm 

200
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,834
concerned.
Not Everything is political despite the 

201
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:15,050
insistence of people who feel that the 
personal is always political.

202
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,943
It's like,
um,

203
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,340
no.
There's philosophical domain.

204
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,193
A theological domain in the 
psychological domain though should be 

205
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:24,440
kept the hell separate from politics.
All right.

206
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,790
What can a too agreeable young woman do 
to be more disagreeable and assertive if

207
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:33,830
that isn't how she is temperamentally 
inclined?

208
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,360
Oh,
that's a good question.

209
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,194
And I would say first of all,
that's a very common question that 

210
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,603
people who go into psychotherapy ask.
I think the most common problem that 

211
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:46,484
psychotherapists deal with apart from 
anxiety and depression is probably 

212
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,010
assertiveness training.
Um,

213
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,590
so the thing I would say is you really 
need to figure out what you want.

214
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,113
And I would recommend doing the self 
authoring program and the future 

215
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,090
authoring program in particular because 
if you want to stand up for yourself,

216
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,390
you have to have your goals and your 
vision well laid out and well defined.

217
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,550
And then you have to have a strategy,
um,

218
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,270
that that is matched to those goals so 
that you can,

219
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,930
so that you know what you want so that 
you know when you're not getting it.

220
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,390
Otherwise you're left with a vague sense
of dissatisfaction and resentment.

221
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,610
And that's very,
very difficult thing to articulate.

222
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,550
And if you can't articulate it,
then you can't negotiate.

223
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,100
If you know what you want and you know 
why,

224
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,440
then you can make a case for yourself.
Okay.

225
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:39,370
So let's assume now that you've laid out
a vision and a counter vision,

226
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,590
which the future authoring program also 
helps you do.

227
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,750
So you know what kind of hell you want 
to avoid,

228
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,440
that you might drift into if you were to
agreeable for the rest of your life.

229
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,280
And that would be a hell that consisted 
mostly of people taking advantage of you

230
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,650
all the time and you feeling resentful 
and bitter about it.

231
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,360
Not something I would recommend.
Um,

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,190
see,
I think that women are agreeable because

233
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,413
it helps them deal with infants,
but it's not a great temperamental 

234
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,630
strategy for dealing with complex 
organizations in,

235
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,200
in the adult world.

236
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,970
So I think it's a price that women pay 
for.

237
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:17,230
Also being adapted to have plenty of 
patients for very young children.

238
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,663
And then you have to overcome that to 
some degree to put yourself forward 

239
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,780
properly in more complex hierarchies of 
accomplishment.

240
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
So I would say once you have your vision
established,

241
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,990
your vision for the future and your 
counter vision,

242
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,900
so you're afraid of what will happen if 
you don't stand up for yourself,

243
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,990
then you need to consult your resentment
fig.

244
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,850
Because if you're resentful about 
something,

245
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,460
as far as I can tell,
there's generally only two reasons.

246
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,670
One is you should grow the hell up and 
quit whining,

247
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,623
so you've got to find out first.
If you're just feeling sorry for 

248
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:52,600
yourself and you can think that through,
make a pro and con case and you can talk

249
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,310
to somebody that you care about about 
that.

250
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,970
I'm not assuming that that's the reason,
but that's one potential reason.

251
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,030
If you're not merely feeling sorry for 
yourself,

252
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,900
then you probably have something to say 
and something that you need and you need

253
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:05,734
to figure out what that is and then you 
have to develop a strategy to to put 

254
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,334
that forward.
I've seen lots of people in my personal 

255
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:16,180
life and in my private practice not get 
what they want because,

256
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,691
well,
a,

257
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,480
they don't specify it and B,
they don't ask for it.

258
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,730
And if you're negotiating safe for a 
razor,

259
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,630
for a promotion and so forth,
you have to put yourself forward.

260
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,240
You need to tell your the person you're 
working for,

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,313
why you should be treated with more 
consideration or respect or have more 

262
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,100
resources devoted to your more 
authority.

263
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,350
Um,
what shifted to you?

264
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,723
And you have to make a case for that,
a compelling case so that they have a 

265
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,960
reason to attend to you.

266
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,650
And that's not going,
they're not going to notice because most

267
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,860
managerial types are so overloaded with 
work that they never,

268
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,003
when anything's going right,
they just notice the things that are 

269
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,050
going wrong.
So you need to make a plan,

270
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,080
you have to have a strategy that goes 
along with that plan.

271
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,063
You have to have articulated arguments 
for why certain a certain form of 

272
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,500
treatment is appropriate to you.
And then you have to have the courage to

273
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,334
put that forward.
And I guess you have to remember that 

274
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:16,430
you owe yourself as much as you owe 
other people.

275
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,920
You have to take care of yourself.
Like you take care of other people and,

276
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,880
and that's a moral duty and if you 
practice that,

277
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,370
you can do it.
And a lot of that has a lot of,

278
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,440
that's also associated with telling the 
truth.

279
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,274
You know,
you don't have a better friend than the 

280
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,014
truth,
even though it can be very harsh in the 

281
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,724
short term.

282
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,750
And so if you're unhappy at work because
you're being taken advantage of,

283
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,584
then you have to strategize yourself out
of that and you have to learn to 

284
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,194
negotiate.
And a lot of that also means that you 

285
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:44,420
have to overcome your hesitancy to 
engage in conflict.

286
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,190
And you've got to think about it this 
way.

287
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,733
Negotiation and conflict are somewhat 
indistinguishable and it's easy moment 

288
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,394
to moment to avoid negotiation conflict,
but you pay a terrible price for it in 

289
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,204
the medium to long term.
It's better to face the conflict 

290
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,620
forthrightly in the present and make 
peace for the medium to long term.

291
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,300
And there's,
there's courage in that.

292
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,440
So that's the other thing I would say is
gird up your loins and,

293
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,700
and,
and,

294
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,923
and

295
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,530
allow yourself to act courageously,
courageously.

296
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:19,364
And truthfully,
truth is your best bet if you're too 

297
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,060
agreeable.
So you know,

298
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,700
you also might find that you have a 
pretty good critical intelligence,

299
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,610
but that you think it's mean and so that
you keep it hidden.

300
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,770
Some of the smartest women I knew who 
were very,

301
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,604
very agreeable had unbelievably good 
instincts with regards to figuring out 

302
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,404
what other people's motives were,
but they were ashamed of their 

303
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,703
suspicions.
And really what that meant was they 

304
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:42,224
ended up being ashamed of their critical
intelligence because they were so 

305
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,314
agreeable.
So it may be that the darker part of 

306
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,030
you,
the shadow part of you knows things that

307
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,550
you could know if you are willing to 
admit that they were true.

308
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,520
And so you have to give some credence to
your,

309
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,310
to your darker element,
I would say.

310
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,193
How do you know if you were 
communicating with the actual person or 

311
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:17,614
a mask?
I sometimes wonder if I can ever really 

312
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,340
know someone.
Well,

313
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,660
you can't ever thoroughly know someone 
because people are too complicated.

314
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:26,494
You can't even really know yourself.
How do you know if you're communicating 

315
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,180
with the actual person or a mask?
Well,

316
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,670
if you're communicating with an actual 
person,

317
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,590
then you're actually having a 
conversation.

318
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,873
You know when the conversation 
transforms as a consequence of 

319
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:43,060
participating in it and it tends to be 
engaging and meaningful.

320
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,680
If what's happening is an exchange of 
ideological platitudes or,

321
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,340
or just platitudes themselves for that 
matter,

322
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,680
then you're probably engaging with a 
mask.

323
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,020
So if the conversation is compelling and
meaningful and it transforms as it as it

324
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,854
progresses and,
and you can see that give and take that 

325
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,730
dance,
like give and take,

326
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,160
then you're communicating with an actual
person.

327
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,323
The other thing I would say is that when
you're communicating with an actual 

328
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,894
person rather than a mask,
the person that you're communicating 

329
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,450
with tends to be quite interesting.
You know,

330
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,284
if people talk about what they know,
which means you're really communicating 

331
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,034
with them.
If they talk about their own personal 

332
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,224
experience instead of wandering off into
the domain of cliches and ideological 

333
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,074
platitudes,
then people tend to be extraordinarily 

334
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,834
interesting.
And so that's another good tactic and a 

335
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:35,844
good hint that you're,
that you're where you should be when 

336
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,160
you're conversing.
One of the rules I had when I was seeing

337
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,203
clients actively was that if the 
conversation I was having wasn't 

338
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,480
interesting and if my attention started 
to wonder,

339
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:49,314
then we weren't discussing issues that 
were sufficiently vital because if we 

340
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:58,020
were discussing vital issues,
then the conversation basically flew by.

341
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,870
And so I think that's a good,
that's a good marker.

342
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,743
What new wisdom have you acquired in the
past few months that you want to share 

343
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,200
it with us?
Well,

344
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,034
I've got one,
I think I thought thought up a bunch of 

345
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:16,120
new things,
but this one I'm really happy with.

346
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,530
I figured out why.
You know,

347
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,753
some of you know that there's a 
mythological trope that I discussed 

348
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,274
fairly frequently about rescuing your 
father from the belly of the dragon or 

349
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,424
the belly of the beast.
It's a motif that you see when you see 

350
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:35,070
it in the lion king.
Um,

351
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,000
you see it when Simba is being initiated
by the baboons.

352
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,853
Um,
I don't remember Nephi Fiki I think his 

353
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:42,910
name is,
um,

354
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,530
after Nela humiliates him because he's 
still a pathetic adolescent.

355
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,150
He follows the baboons.
I think it's a mandrill actually,

356
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,360
um,
down underground,

357
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,194
essentially through a long tunnel.
There's a lot of kind of scary music in 

358
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:02,770
the background and he ends up 
contemplating himself in a dark pool and

359
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,660
then his father appears in the sky.

360
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,733
And so that's one example of the re 
construction of the mythology of 

361
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,530
encountering your father in the abyss.
You look into the abyss and you see your

362
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,870
father.
And then in the Pinocchio Story,

363
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,730
um,
Pinocchio of course,

364
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,160
when he's trying to become a genuine 
human being,

365
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,110
instead of a marionette pulled by other 
people's strings or a neurotic or a,

366
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,130
or a liar or a jackass,
cause those are his alternate destinies.

367
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,413
Um,
he goes down to the darkest place he 

368
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:36,070
could find the bottom of the ocean and 
finds the biggest monster.

369
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:36,904
He can look at it.
And inside he finds his father and in 

370
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:40,270
rescues.
And um,

371
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,813
and the question is,
why do you find your father when you 

372
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,020
look into the abyss?
And I really did do,

373
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,480
I figured this out and it's quite 
exciting to me.

374
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,610
All right.
It's such a brilliant image.

375
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,230
So we know as clinicians,
and also I would say a sensible people,

376
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,950
but there's good clinical documentation 
of this that if you find out,

377
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,193
imagine someone's pursuing a goal and 
some of the things they have to 

378
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:08,410
accomplish or confront on the way to 
that goal,

379
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,130
frightened them and they start to avoid 
and then they get more afraid.

380
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,963
And of course their ability to pursue 
their goal or to accomplish their goal 

381
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,554
deteriorates because they're avoiding,
if you're a psychotherapist or even a 

382
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,200
friend or,
or,

383
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,160
or a supportive loved one,
let's say,

384
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,900
you're going to encourage the person to 
face the challenges that are making them

385
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:29,734
afraid to face them voluntarily.
And what happens as a consequence of 

386
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,684
that is that the person usually is able 
to overcome those fears and develop the 

387
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:42,490
necessary skills and,
and to prevail.

388
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,570
And that's partly because not so much 
because they get less afraid,

389
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,780
but because they get more skilled and 
more courageous.

390
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:50,614
And so imagine that if you
bite off a little more than you can 

391
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,160
chew,
you get stronger as a consequence.

392
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,620
And you do that in the gym.
For example,

393
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:00,454
when you go lift weights,
you lift weights that are a little 

394
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,000
heavier all the time.
And as a consequence,

395
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:07,540
you develop yourself physically and you 
turn into who you could be.

396
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,150
You turned into more than you are.
Okay?

397
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,750
So if you face fears a little bit at a 
time,

398
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,090
fears and challenges,
and you do that voluntarily,

399
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,600
then you become more than who you are.
Okay?

400
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,434
Now let's recast that in architectural 
language and make it into a kind of 

401
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,850
ultimate.
So,

402
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,330
so if you want to become everything that
you could be,

403
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,463
then you look into the abyss itself,
which is the darkest place that you can 

404
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,094
possibly contemplate.
And that would be the terror of more 

405
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,850
mortality and insanity.
And,

406
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,940
and if suffering and end of malevolence,
all of those,

407
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,670
it would be like looking into hell,
I suppose to some degree.

408
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,420
And then by voluntarily doing that,
then you call upon the strongest part of

409
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:49,714
yourself to respond.
And the strongest part of yourself is 

410
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:56,170
symbolized as the sleeping farther 
nested inside the beast.

411
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,650
And so the fundamental truth when you 
look into an abyss is that you don't see

412
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,230
the abyss.

413
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,063
If you look long enough,
it's like the answer to niches 

414
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,883
conundrum.
If you look long enough into a bis and 

415
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:09,790
ambitious than the abyss looks into you,
it's like,

416
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,624
well,
if you look long enough into an abyss 

417
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,140
passed when the abyss looks into you,
you see who you could become in the form

418
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:17,974
of your,
of the great ancestral figures nested 

419
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:25,501
inside the catastrophe of life and then 
you can join them so to speak.

420
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,584
You can incorporate that and become 
stronger and you do that partly by 

421
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,574
taking on the challenge voluntarily and 
that informs you because you learn when 

422
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:38,410
you take on challenges voluntarily.
But you also do that as a consequence of

423
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,273
psychophysiological transformation 
because when you place yourself in 

424
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:42,904
challenging situations,
let's say the abyss is the archetype of 

425
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,424
the ultimately challenging situation,
then you turn on new genes in your 

426
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:51,344
nervous system and in your body that 
code for new proteins and you build new 

427
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:55,544
structures inside of you and none of 
that's going to happen without the 

428
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:03,530
demand that's placed on you by willing 
to confront the full terror of life.

429
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,820
And so then I would say the full terror 
of life is something like the reality of

430
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,850
suffering and death and the ever present
in the,

431
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,013
the ever looming presence of malevolence
in your own heart and in the heart of 

432
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:15,944
other people.
So it's evil and suffering and to 

433
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:22,160
confront that is really well you risk 
blindness by confronting that.

434
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,280
That's also a very old story.
You risk damaging your vision,

435
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,473
but if you do it forthrightly,
then you discover who you could be as a 

436
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:35,201
consequence and who you could be is the 
solution to malevolence and suffering.

437
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,510
And so that just blew me away when I 
figured that out.

438
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,870
It was partly a consequence of,
um,

439
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,223
having lengthy discussions with Sam 
Harris and thinking this through more 

440
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,460
and more been pushed to think it 
through.

441
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,160
But I think that's an absolutely 
staggering.

442
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,220
Um,
what would you call it?

443
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,800
Articulating that,
articulating that image fully for me.

444
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,110
I don't know if I've articulated it 
fully,

445
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:03,350
but articulating it more fully really 
had a profound effect on me.

446
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,184
I think that's,
it's such a brilliant conceptualization 

447
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,693
that inside the darkest place is the 
heroic ancestor that whose identity you 

448
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,030
could incorporate.
Perfect.

449
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,770
It's perfect.
And I really believe it's true.

450
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:19,604
And what it does is it says that human 
being is actually stronger than the 

451
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,600
greatest challenge that can be set 
before him or her.

452
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,300
And that's really something.
I also believe it's true.

453
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,463
It doesn't matter how,
the other thing that's so interesting 

454
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:36,470
about that is that it,
it transforms pessimism into optimism.

455
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:36,891
It's like,
well,

456
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:37,724
the world is a very dark place.
It's full of suffering and it's full of 

457
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,484
malevolence.
And it might even be so full of 

458
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:42,944
suffering and malevolence that a 
reasonable person could question the 

459
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:50,830
justification of its being a,
as a Ivan Karamozov does in,

460
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,240
in the brothers Karamazov which I would 
highly recommend.

461
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,070
By the way,
that's an absolutely great book,

462
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,780
dusty fce.
Um,

463
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,900
but the,
the truth of the matter seems to be that

464
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:03,410
if you face the pessimism full frontal,
so to speak,

465
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,040
um,
then you find something in you that can,

466
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,560
that's strong enough to take it on.
And that's really says something about,

467
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,100
what would you say the relationship 
between human beings in divinity,

468
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:16,934
I would say,
because it takes something transcendent 

469
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,893
of transcendent power to be able to rise
above the genuine suffering and 

470
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:27,404
malevolence of life.
And I do think that we have that within 

471
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,670
us if we don't shy away from the 
challenge.

472
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,710
So you know,
there's in,

473
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,910
in the story of King Arthur and the holy
grail,

474
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,040
so the holy grail is one of two things.
It's a cup that either held the,

475
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,240
that Christ drank at the last supper or 
that was used to catch his blood when he

476
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,220
was speared on the cross.

477
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,230
Either one.
But it's the,

478
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,450
it's the reservoir,
let's say,

479
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:58,320
of the fluid that eternally nourishes.
It's something like that.

480
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,770
And when you go to look for the holy 
Grail,

481
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:04,650
you don't know where to look because you
don't know where the holy grail is.

482
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,680
And so King Arthur and his knights who 
all sit at a round table because they're

483
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,970
essentially equals each go off to find 
the holy grail.

484
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:12,804
And each of them enters the forest to 
begin the quest at the place that looks 

485
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:17,934
darkest to him.
And that's another example of the same 

486
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,880
idea,
is that what you and another,

487
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,730
it's another example of a dictum from 
Carl Young,

488
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:28,860
which he extracted from the all chemical
literature,

489
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:32,070
which was in stir curliness invented 
tour,

490
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,113
which means roughly speaking in filth 
that will be found or more to the point 

491
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,070
what you most need will be found where 
you least want to look,

492
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,930
but you have to look purposefully.

493
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,540
If it chases you,
your prey,

494
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,080
if you confront it,
then you're the thing that can transcend

495
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:49,914
it.
And that's a unbelievably optimistic 

496
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,154
message because it suggests that if 
you're willing to take on the burden of 

497
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,290
being with it's suffering and 
malevolence,

498
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,910
that you can awaken that with that which
is within you,

499
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:07,911
that will allow you to prevail.
And God only knows how deep an idea that

500
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,040
is.
It might be the deepest of ideas because

501
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,340
who knows what the limit of a human 
being is so well,

502
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,570
that's some of the wisdom,
so to speak,

503
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,160
that have acquired in the last few 
months.

504
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:22,070
And there's quite a bit more too.
But I,

505
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm going to write all this down and 
hopefully publish a bunch of it.

506
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:26,274
And my next book I figured out a bunch 
about hierarchies to and how they 

507
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,630
function.
And a whole,

508
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,620
I've developed a whole new way of 
conceptualizing.

509
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,843
One of the things I was arguing with 
about Sam arguing with about with Sam 

510
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,363
Harris was the relationship between 
facts and values because Sam and he has 

511
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:46,164
his reasons.
We'd like to propose that we can derive 

512
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:51,240
values directly from facts.
And he wants to do that because he wants

513
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,980
to nail the world of values to something
solid so it doesn't float in air and,

514
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,953
and,
and,

515
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,380
and get,
let's say,

516
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,020
um,
what would you call it?

517
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,150
Hijacked by the fundamentalists or 
dissolve into nihilism.

518
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,150
And both of those are terrible ends for 
a hierarchy of value.

519
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:14,151
So he wants to nail it to something more
objective and,

520
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,923
and less relativistic and less,
less grounded in revealed truth that 

521
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,630
removes it from the domain of 
fundamentalism.

522
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:27,960
And so I can understand his point and 
why he wants to do that.

523
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:28,794
But the problem is is that it isn't easy
to drive values from facts because 

524
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:32,664
there's an infinite number of facts and 
by necessity a very finite number of 

525
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,440
values.

526
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,273
In fact,
most of the time when you're doing 

527
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,860
something,
you're reducing the whole world to value

528
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,963
and that value is encapsulated in 
whatever goal you happened to be 

529
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,400
pursuing at the moment or whatever 
you're paying attention to,

530
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,560
which is also a form of goal directed 
pursuit.

531
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,160
And so I've also figured out that,
and I kind of knew this,

532
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:54,994
but I could articulate it better now,
that you look at the world of facts 

533
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:58,984
through a hierarchy of values and that 
hierarchy of values is instantiated in 

534
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:02,734
your nervous system and simultaneously a
social construct because you pay 

535
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,224
attention to things of value that you 
and everyone else have established as 

536
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:15,160
valuable through a process of social 
negotiation.

537
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,370
And you need to pay attention to what 
you think that's valuable,

538
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:19,204
that everyone else thinks is valuable 
because otherwise you wouldn't have any 

539
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:22,984
basis for shared attention and you 
wouldn't have any basis for trade with 

540
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:26,644
other people.

541
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,920
So that's another thing.
So that's really been helpful because,

542
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,023
so now I figured out that you reduce the
infinite world of facts to the finite 

543
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:36,424
world of values by viewing the world of 
facts through what's essentially a 

544
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:43,870
dominance hierarchy of value.
And that's,

545
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,093
and that that exists both out in the 
social world and neurologically at the 

546
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,114
same time.
And so that's been unbelievably useful 

547
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:52,144
to figure out too,
and a part of a mystery that I'd been 

548
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,860
trying to untangle for about three 
decades.

549
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,023
So that's extremely helpful.
And I've also spent some more time 

550
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,990
thinking about the proper place of the 
right and the left wing.

551
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,390
So the right wing basically stands for 
the,

552
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,730
um,
what would you call the,

553
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,570
the right wing serves as an advocate for
hierarchy.

554
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,300
And the left wing serves as a critic of 
hierarchy and the rights says,

555
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,134
well,
we need hierarchies there often 

556
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,160
hierarchies of competence,
they're necessary to organize people and

557
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,290
society and they're necessary to get 
things done,

558
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,870
all of which is true.
And the left says yes,

559
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:35,704
but hierarchies dispossessed and you 
have to pay attention to the widows and 

560
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,140
the orphans,
which is also true.

561
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,620
And so then the political discussion is 
about how to ensure that hierarchies are

562
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:47,494
maintained and are functional,
but also have sufficient mercy within 

563
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:52,504
them to take care of the people who for 
one reason or another are struggling to 

564
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:59,350
find their place even in a hierarchy of 
competence.

565
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,740
And then the necessity for free speech 
emerges out of that because the left and

566
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,030
the right have to communicate.
So that,

567
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,490
okay,

568
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,550
the proper balance between the,
the,

569
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,910
the current structure of the hierarchy 
and it's transformation and mercy can be

570
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,280
established on an ongoing basis.
So anyways,

571
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,830
there are three things that I've really 
learned over the last few months.

572
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,750
There's a bunch more,
but those will do for now.

573
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,243
Um,

574
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,150
if too much masculine masculinity is 
tyranny,

575
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,690
but the right amount is order and too 
much feminine is chaos,

576
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,620
what's the word for the right amount of 
femininity?

577
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,010
That's a really good question.
I read that a bit earlier and I couldn't

578
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,844
come up with something immediate.
But the only thing I can think of is 

579
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:09,811
that often femininity has been 
characterized as wisdom.

580
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,690
And maybe that's so,
so the,

581
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,700
the wisdom that God in the Judeo 
Christian tradition that God consults is

582
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,650
feminine.
That's an old tradition.

583
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,173
And maybe that's because order needs to 
be leaving with the right amount of 

584
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,850
chaos in order for wisdom to emerge the 
order,

585
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:36,520
it can be blinded and tyrannical and 
dead.

586
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,103
And so it's,
it's the mixture of the right amount of 

587
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,853
chaos that turns that order into wisdom.
And then that wisdom is often persona 

588
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:46,600
fired,
his feminine.

589
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,433
Now that doesn't exactly answer your 
question because it doesn't make the 

590
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:53,320
right balance.
You still don't have tyranny order.

591
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,270
Okay.

592
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,040
You still don't have order tyranny,
chaos.

593
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,560
You're still missing the proper word 
there.

594
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,540
Um,
I don't,

595
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,580
it's a,
it's a good question.

596
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,230
And,
and the wisdom ideas,

597
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:08,064
the best I can make of it for now,
is it better to marry someone with your 

598
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:16,080
temperament or a contracting 
complimentary temperament?

599
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,633
Well,
there is evidence on this and basically 

600
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,070
you don't want to marry someone with 
whom you're two mismatched.

601
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,353
Now,
the only possible exception to that is 

602
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:26,964
neuroticism.
Neuroticism is a good predictor of 

603
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:33,030
marital trouble and it's a good 
predictor of trouble,

604
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,370
period.
Or perhaps sensitivity to trouble,

605
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:39,270
which is in some sense the same thing.
It's very,

606
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,740
and I don't know of any research 
specifically pertaining to this.

607
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,241
Um,
no,

608
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:48,540
I know that people who are high in 
neuroticism are more likely to miss work

609
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:52,640
and to visit the doctor and to um,
and,

610
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,930
and to be unhappy in their marriages and
so forth.

611
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:00,230
And that may also account for why 75% of
divorces are initiated by women.

612
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,643
Um,
and I think women are more sensitive to 

613
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,400
negative emotion,
partly because they have to take care of

614
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:07,590
infants and need to be more sensitive to
threat.

615
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:08,424
And perhaps because sexuality is more 
dangerous to women and perhaps because 

616
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:14,334
women are physically smaller and all of 
this seems to kick in at puberty 

617
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,893
anyways.
It isn't obvious to me that you want to 

618
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,190
match someone with regards to 
neuroticism.

619
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:26,220
If you're high in neuroticism,
I think if you're high in neuroticism,

620
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:28,530
you need to find someone who's low in 
neuroticism,

621
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,953
um,
because then you have someone around to 

622
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:34,170
calm you down.
Now apart from that,

623
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,980
the research literature does indicate 
match is better and you can see why it's

624
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,860
hard for extroverts and introverts to 
get along if they're,

625
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,843
especially if they're extreme extroverts
and extreme introverts because an 

626
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:47,784
extreme extrovert always wants to be 
with other people and in groups and an 

627
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,650
extreme introvert hardly ever wants that
and that's a very,

628
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:57,480
very difficult thing to negotiate.

629
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,900
And then with conscientiousness,
same thing.

630
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:01,734
If you're really high in orderliness,
it's very hard to be married to someone 

631
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,004
who very low and ordered in this.
You're going to end up doing all the 

632
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:07,674
cleaning for example,
that will drive you crazy and if you're 

633
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:11,220
high and industriousness,
same thing,

634
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,060
healthy are super high and 
industriousness and orderliness.

635
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,080
You might want someone who's maybe 
moderate in both to kind of temper you a

636
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,914
bit because one of the problems with 
being too high in conscientiousness is 

637
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:23,184
that you can't stop working and you 
should probably stop working from time 

638
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,810
to time.
Agreeableness,

639
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,853
same thing,
hard for an agreeable and disagreeable 

640
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,310
person to get along.
You know,

641
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:37,311
the agreeable person will always be
the disagreeable person

642
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,293
who won't shy away from conflict is 
likely to dominate the agreeable person 

643
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:47,720
quite badly.
So that's a tough bridge to two.

644
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,873
That's a tough chasm to bridge as well.
So you look for temperamental 

645
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,960
similarity.
I'm at now it's complicated because like

646
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:58,894
if you're really,
really low and industriousness and you 

647
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:02,320
marry someone else who's really low and 
industriousness,

648
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,154
well that's going to be trouble for both
of you because there isn't going to be 

649
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,210
anyone around who's going to do the 
work.

650
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,940
So,
um,

651
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,023
you might understand each other better,
but as a longterm strategy it's not a 

652
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:14,350
very good one.
So

653
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,300
it seems like your message is primarily 
positive masculine,

654
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,913
whereas the positive feminine is not 
elaborated with near the same 

655
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:25,900
resolution.
What do you think?

656
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,260
Um,
I don't really think that's true.

657
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,094
I,
I think that might be somewhat true of 

658
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,970
12 rules for life,
although I'm not convinced of that.

659
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:38,200
That message and 12 rules for life is to
find a balance between order and chaos.

660
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,633
And there's plenty of discussion in 
there about the danger of an excess of 

661
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,180
both.
Certainly maps of meaning is,

662
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,463
um,
elaborated out more with regards to the 

663
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,234
positive masculine or with regards to 
maps of meaning is elaborated out more 

664
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:58,654
completely than 12 rules with regards to
the positive role of the masculine and 

665
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,670
the feminine.
Um,

666
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,033
I think it's complicated in part because
the feminine classically speaking is 

667
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:15,991
associated with smaller scale intimate 
familial groupings.

668
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,783
And so

669
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,733
in a world that's obsessed with 
adaptation to large scale social 

670
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:30,184
systems,
it's harder to make a case for the role 

671
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:34,834
of the feminine.
We don't understand the role of the 

672
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,470
feminine in large scale social 
structures.

673
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,540
So,
and you know,

674
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:45,460
we don't have a cultural myth apart from
beauty and the beast,

675
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,294
let's say,
that describes the role of an 

676
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:53,671
independent female operating in the 
fundamentally masculine social world.

677
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,020
And we don't even know what something 
like that would look like.

678
00:38:59,021 --> 00:38:59,854
And there aren't guiding stories to some
degree because women haven't been able 

679
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:08,110
to do that except in the last hundred 
years.

680
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,053
So I don't know what,
what the positive feminine on a large 

681
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,064
scale would look like.
And we don't have guiding stories for 

682
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,354
that.
This is partly to underlined the 

683
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,440
absolutely radical nature of the birth 
control pill.

684
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,170
And and not only that,
but the provision of,

685
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,153
of,
of technological devices that aid women 

686
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:38,251
in dealing practically with their weekly
or their monthly menstrual cycle,

687
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:43,861
which was also a huge impediment to 
women in terms of interacting in the,

688
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,120
let's say the patriarchal world.

689
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,920
So now women can take their place in the
broader cultural world and we don't know

690
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,160
what the model for that is.
So you know,

691
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,994
you might say,
well they should adopt the heroin 

692
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,100
masculine perspective and certainly to 
some degree that's true,

693
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:00,934
but that's not a particularly fruitful 
archetype when it comes to having a 

694
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,174
family and having a family is actually 
extraordinarily important and it's 

695
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:14,434
certainly the thing that dominates the 
thoughts of the majority of women as 

696
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:22,330
they approached their thirties all 
cultural noise to the contrary.

697
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,883
So it's something we're still puzzling 
out and I suppose I'm still puzzling it 

698
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:29,140
out too.
I mean with my daughter,

699
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,800
I tried to encourage her to be as sharp 
and is intelligent and critically minded

700
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:36,904
and ambitious as she could be,
but also let her to let her know that 

701
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,790
if,
and she,

702
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,653
she,
she was always interested in having 

703
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:45,724
kids.

704
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,683
Um,
but to also let her know that having a 

705
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:51,260
family as an extremely important thing,
um,

706
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,533
how to balance that.
Well that is the modern conundrum isn't 

707
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:55,384
it?
We want to figure out how to maximize 

708
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:58,594
our access to the talents of women but 
also to set up a situation where it's 

709
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:07,951
possible for talented women and women of
all talents let's say as well,

710
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,063
but talented women who have options in 
the workplace to also have a family and 

711
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,504
this is a tremendously complex problem 
and it isn't clear how it's going to be 

712
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:19,480
solved.
You know,

713
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,950
there is data showing,
you know,

714
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,784
you say,
well men should pick up more of the 

715
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,270
feminine role and I suppose that's 
possible.

716
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,970
But there is good data showing for 
example,

717
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:32,971
that if you show women pictures of men 
engaged in classically masculine,

718
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,900
you know,
fixing a roof for fixing the plumbing or

719
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,360
so forth,
um,

720
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,310
or in feminine endeavors doing the 
dishes and,

721
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:41,091
and,
and,

722
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:41,924
and vacuuming that the women raped the 
man who are doing the female tasks as 

723
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,094
well as less sexually attractive.
And so it's not all on the men with 

724
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:53,900
regards to the utility of them picking 
up a more feminine role,

725
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,153
you know,
and it isn't necessarily the case that 

726
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,280
women will find men who are more 
domestic,

727
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,203
also maximumly sexually attractive.
Those things don't necessarily go 

728
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:06,260
together.
So this is very,

729
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:08,630
very complicated.
So

730
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,090
I'm quite shy and when asked questions 
in public,

731
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,490
I find it hard to articulate a good 
answer,

732
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,120
but we'll come up with a strong response
hours or days later.

733
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,440
Any advice?
Yeah,

734
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,900
I have some advice.
One is that,

735
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:27,734
um,
well you're probably introverted a so 

736
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:29,984
you're not as verbally fluent as an 
extrovert would be a not quite as fast 

737
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,580
on the draw verbally,
but you know,

738
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:35,414
that means you need some more time to 
contemplate and maybe you're high in 

739
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,100
negative emotion too.
Um,

740
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,760
because shyness can be a combination of 
introversion and high negative emotion.

741
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,950
It can be one or the other,
but,

742
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,790
but technically shy is introverted.
Um,

743
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,390
anyways,
what I would certainly recommend for you

744
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:57,380
is that if you're faced with a 
complicated question,

745
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,830
especially one that has to do with an 
important decision in your life,

746
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:05,720
that you say,
I need to sleep on it or I need a couple

747
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,740
of days and not to answer,
um,

748
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,603
on the draw.

749
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,430
I mean,
I think that's true even for extroverts.

750
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:14,264
I think if you're at called upon to 
offer your opinion about something 

751
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:20,270
complex,
then it's perfectly reasonable to say,

752
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:22,310
look,
that's a really hard question.

753
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,230
I'm not going to give you a casual 
answer.

754
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,270
I need to think about it for a couple of
days.

755
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,890
So the advice would be because you find 
it hard to articulate a good answer,

756
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:31,724
don't allow yourself to be rushed.
And the second is to understand that 

757
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:37,550
this is part of your temperament there.
There isn't anything wrong with it.

758
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,320
It's just,
it's,

759
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,000
it's,
it's how you're wired.

760
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,223
So

761
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:47,320
what causes a person to hoard?
Is it due to low conscientiousness?

762
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,780
What is generally the best course of 
treatment?

763
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,640
Um,
it's usually a consequence of relatively

764
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,590
high in neuroticism.
Um,

765
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,060
and it's tangled in with disgust,
sensitivity as well.

766
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,003
People who hoard have a hard time,
they feel guilty if they throw things 

767
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:11,350
away because the thing's still have some
residual utility.

768
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:12,843
The best course of treatment is well 
behavioral therapies probably the best 

769
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,170
course of treatment.
Um,

770
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,643
and to plan what needs to be thrown away
and to work with a person that can help 

771
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:33,390
you make the hard decisions that,
that need to be made.

772
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:38,391
If you're hoarding
all that,

773
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:39,924
all that hoarded material is,
and it's decisions that have been put 

774
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,600
off.
So a lot of that is high neuroticism.

775
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,700
I,
some of that can be a consequence of low

776
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,534
conscientiousness as well.
So the best course of treatment is to 

777
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:59,130
find someone to help you plan how to 
approach the,

778
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,380
the horde.
Very complicated.

779
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,950
So all right.
Which hogwarts house would you be in?

780
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,180
Well,
I think I'd have the same issue as Harry

781
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,013
Potter when the hat was first put on,
it would think that I might make a 

782
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:31,810
perfectly good dennis in of slitherin.
So,

783
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,210
um,
although that probably wouldn't be where

784
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,150
I would end up.
So

785
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,900
what is your take on an astrological 
basis for significant dates in religious

786
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,310
stories?
Example,

787
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,220
Christian religion is a parody on the 
worship of the sun.

788
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,050
Well,
it's certainly not a parody.

789
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,810
Um,
religion,

790
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:58,703
religious systems as they expand tend to
incorporate everything that's quasi 

791
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:04,314
religious in the culture.
And there's certainly no shortage of 

792
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:09,780
solar symbolism in Christianity.
I mean,

793
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:14,781
it's not fluke that that Christ is the 
son and there are 12 disciples just like

794
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:18,900
there are 12 astrological houses and 
it's not fluke that,

795
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,193
um,
the birth of Christ takes place 

796
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:24,780
essentially at the,
at the same time as,

797
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,703
as,
as the shortest day of the year and the 

798
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:30,750
rebirth of the sun.
All of these things line up.

799
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,613
Now,
whether that synchronicity or whether 

800
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:34,044
it's the attempt by the collective 
imagination of human beings to align 

801
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:43,740
everything under a single truth,
that's a very difficult thing to say.

802
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:44,723
Or maybe there's a single truth at work.
But the idea that Christian religion is 

803
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:50,580
a parody on the worship of the sun is 
not,

804
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,473
is definitely not the case.
It's more like it's incorporated 

805
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:58,050
elements of the worship of the sun over 
thousands and thousands of years.

806
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,950
And that's a very complicated issue.
If you're interested in that,

807
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:05,910
you could read I on Ai,
o n it's booked by Carl Young,

808
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:08,190
which is like the most terrifying book 
I've ever read.

809
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,353
And so you could,
there's a deeper analysis of the 

810
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:14,400
relationship between astrological 
speculation,

811
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,900
um,
and,

812
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,900
and the emergence of complex religious 
stories.

813
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,213
So

814
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,360
my brother 29 to sick at home with 
burnout.

815
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,100
He's a perfectionist,
has anxiety,

816
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,400
has trouble dealing with stress.
How can I help them become stronger?

817
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,413
Well,
you could encourage him to go talk to a 

818
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,620
therapist.
You could tell him to go find broadly,

819
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,583
make an appointment with three of them.
Go talk to each one for an hour and if 

820
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:49,440
he likes one of them and he finds one 
who listens,

821
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:50,274
then he can go back a couple more times.
But it isn't going to hurt him to go 

822
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:54,930
once at least to go talk.
Um,

823
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,830
it's also possible that he needs someone
to talk to them about medication.

824
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,600
You know,
antidepressants,

825
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,613
if he's written real trouble.
Antidepressants are often very helpful 

826
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:04,890
to people,
not always,

827
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:07,410
but often.
And so that is a lot better.

828
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:08,244
Taking an antidepressant beats the hell 
out of being sick at home with burnout 

829
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,810
and it's attended dangers,
cognitive dangers,

830
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:19,530
dangers of stress induced illness,
dangers of suicidal ideation,

831
00:48:19,531 --> 00:48:20,490
all that sort of thing.

832
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,630
Um,
I would also recommend that he tried the

833
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,450
self authoring program.
If he's at home,

834
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,540
he could write about his past,
he could write about his presence,

835
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,700
he could write about his future.
He can do a bad job,

836
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,740
he can do it over days.
I think that,

837
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,783
I mean we have evidence that the program
is extremely helpful to people and 

838
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:41,520
there's evidence from other researchers 
that such programs really help.

839
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:42,354
So that would,
that would be something that he could 

840
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,001
do.
Well,

841
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:47,490
he's sitting at home and it's not going 
to hurt him.

842
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,623
I'm going over some of the more complex 
material might make them feel slightly 

843
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,780
worse in the short term,
but the long term payoff is very,

844
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,250
very high.
So,

845
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,773
um,

846
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,603
that's what I would recommend.
Encourage him to go talk to somebody he 

847
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:04,324
knew and he needs to make the planning 
needs to come to terms with what's 

848
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:08,860
happened to him.
And He needs to make a plan and he might

849
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:12,190
need to talk to somebody for a long time
to figure out what the hell's going on.

850
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,820
You know?
And we also don't want to rule out,

851
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,673
neither does he.
The possibility that there's something 

852
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,460
physical wrong,
you know,

853
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:19,294
because there's increasing evidence that
the depressive disorders and that would 

854
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,180
include anxiety,
are consequence of,

855
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:28,180
of such conditions as,
as generalized inflammation.

856
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,223
And that's really worth looking into.
So I think a lot of the things that we 

857
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:36,100
think are psychological have a more 
pronounced physical basis.

858
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,110
So,
yeah.

859
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,770
How do you dress so well,
any tips?

860
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,630
Well,
you know,

861
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,580
thank you.
Um,

862
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,040
I started buying

863
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,480
nice clothes,
let's say this year.

864
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:56,300
Really.
I had some decent suits before that.

865
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,583
Um,
I did some research online to find out 

866
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:01,460
who good suit manufacturers where you 
can look that up.

867
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:05,930
But in before this tour,
I went and talked to a good tailor,

868
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,053
a expensive place.
I felt terrible spending so much money 

869
00:50:09,651 --> 00:50:11,070
on clothing.
Um,

870
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,180
but I felt that if I was going to go 
talk to,

871
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:17,930
it's been 200,000 people that I was 
going to do it right and,

872
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,510
and I was going to invest in some decent
clothes.

873
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:22,370
And even though it,
it hurt my,

874
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,910
um,
cheap northern Alberta soul to do it,

875
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,370
um,
it was definitely worth it.

876
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,510
So go talk to someone who knows what 
they're doing.

877
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,890
Go talk to an actual Taylor and,
and,

878
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,813
and you can do some research online.
There's lots of resources online that 

879
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:45,080
are devoted towards devoted to helping 
men figure out how to dress.

880
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,760
Three piece suits look pretty good.

881
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,580
I,
I've got them tailored and fitted,

882
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,060
so they're not bespoke suits,
they're off the rack,

883
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:57,800
but they've been tailored and that makes
a big difference.

884
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,770
Uh,
all this subtle things that Taylor's do,

885
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:03,040
they tuck it in around the waist,
they cut it to your body.

886
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:03,874
All of those things help.
It's really good to have a good pair of 

887
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:07,450
shoes.
Couple of Nice ties.

888
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:11,130
I learned how to tie off full Windsor 
Knot recently and that actually helps.

889
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:13,120
So you don't want your tire to look too 
skinny.

890
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,463
Um,
lots of people have been dressing up to 

891
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,114
come to my talk,
so it's nice to see a lot of young men 

892
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,710
come well dressed often in three piece 
suits,

893
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,050
but not always.
And it's really good to see them dressed

894
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:25,090
like grown ups.
I think that's a real plus.

895
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,223
Um,
I had a rule that I didn't write in 12 

896
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:29,794
rules,
which was dressed like the person you 

897
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:31,624
want to be.

898
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,690
That's,
I kind of took that from Carl from,

899
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,750
from nature because Nisha said every 
great man is an actor of his own ideal.

900
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,970
So very nice.
Eight for Islam.

901
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,813
And basically what it meant was that 
sometimes you have to act out what you 

902
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,660
want to be before you become it.
You have to pretend,

903
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,400
and it's not a lie,
it's,

904
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,293
it's really a pretense.
Like children pretend to be a father 

905
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:56,740
before they grow up and become a 
farther,

906
00:51:56,741 --> 00:52:01,300
it's a form of practice.
And so tip one might be,

907
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,973
I figured out who you want to be.
Tip Two might be well then dressed like 

908
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:07,720
that person.
That's a good start.

909
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,930
And because I think if you want to 
become who you want to be,

910
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:15,931
then no detail is too small to overlook.
And certainly it isn't exactly that.

911
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:18,790
People judge you by their clothes,
buy your clothes,

912
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,460
although they do to some degree.
It's that

913
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:27,020
if whatever you can have going for you,
you might as well have going for you.

914
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,883
That's how it looks to me.
And certainly my experience has been 

915
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,214
that the response to my improved 
wardrobe has indicated that the 

916
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,290
investment was clearly worth it,
um,

917
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,233
indisputably and clearly worth it.
And it's nice to be dressed sharply to 

918
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:46,340
go in front of an audience.
It's a sign of respect to the audience.

919
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,380
There's other ways of showing respect to
an audience,

920
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:49,214
but that's certainly one.
And so it's been extraordinarily 

921
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:52,304
worthwhile.
I would say if you're going for a job 

922
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:55,064
interview,
if you're at any critical point in your 

923
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:58,154
life,
then you should dress the part because 

924
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:02,750
you want to do everything.
You can tip the scales in.

925
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,793
Not In your favor exactly,
but in favor of having the right thing 

926
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:07,610
happen.
So

927
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,300
you have written an article on how to 
write.

928
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:15,160
Can you do the same on how to speak?
Well,

929
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,050
I suppose I could,
I could tell you a little bit about it.

930
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,493
Um,

931
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,840
if you're going to speak about 
something,

932
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,663
you need to know a lot about it.
You need to know three or four times as 

933
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,390
much as you're going to speak about at 
minimum.

934
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:32,850
So first of all,
you have to do your background research.

935
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,540
You have to have multiple stories at 
hand that you can use to illustrate your

936
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,680
point.
And you have to have a point,

937
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,460
you have to organize what you're talking
about around a problem.

938
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:48,990
So before I go on stage to speak on my 
tour,

939
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,363
I always sit for half an hour,
some of which involves usually about 

940
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:55,380
five minutes of anxiety.
And I think,

941
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:57,510
okay,
there's a problem.

942
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:00,990
I'm trying to address tonight a central 
problem or a theme,

943
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,400
what is,
it might be courage.

944
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:04,860
It might be responsibility,
it might be meaning.

945
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,173
Um,
I think that serves as an organizing 

946
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,350
principle.
So that would be the point.

947
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,890
And then basically I organize say a 
dozen stories around that and I can kind

948
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:21,231
of arrange them in it as a journey.
And it's a journey that circles the main

949
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:22,644
point.
And so I'm trying to explore it to say 

950
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:27,000
what I think about courage,
let's say,

951
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:31,140
but to take what I'm thinking farther 
than I've taken it already.

952
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,560
And so then I can plot out,
you know,

953
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,370
little five minute stories that I have 
that are associated with courage.

954
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,650
And then I can talk to the audience and 
I would say,

955
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,420
talk about what you know,

956
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,430
use your personal experience because 
that's,

957
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,680
that's something that you're actually a 
master of.

958
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:52,514
You can bring in other material,
but it has to be tied to the real world 

959
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:58,790
through your own experience.
Otherwise it's not real.

960
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,690
It's also very good to speak directly to
the audience,

961
00:55:02,691 --> 00:55:03,524
to the individuals in the audience.
Cause I'm always looking at a single 

962
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,464
person,
one after another and focusing on them 

963
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,110
and talking to them.
Just like you'd have a conversation with

964
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:12,944
someone.
And that way I can see if they're 

965
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:17,210
following along and I'm always listening
to the audience.

966
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,990
What I really like to hear from the 
audience is no noise at all.

967
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:23,690
Silence because of the audience,
especially,

968
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:24,524
you know,
if it's a couple of hundred or a couple 

969
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,550
of thousand people,
if the audience is dead silent,

970
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:33,110
then I know that I'm on the right track.
And so

971
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,890
the other thing I would say is you're 
telling stories.

972
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,440
So every fact that you relate or every 
set of facts has to be tied to a story.

973
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,513
There has to be a meaningful output,
which is something like why is it 

974
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:54,660
important to your life that you know 
this fact?

975
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,200
How is it related to how you're going to
conduct yourself moving forward?

976
00:55:58,201 --> 00:55:59,034
Or how are you going to see the world?
So that's kind of the essence of 

977
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:01,764
meaning.
How does this fact change the way you 

978
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:07,190
perceive the world or act in the world?
That's the meaning of the fact.

979
00:56:07,191 --> 00:56:10,620
And facts without meaning are dull.
So you need to know that.

980
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,160
You need to tell the truth,
that's for sure.

981
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,510
Okay.
And,

982
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,870
and,
and I mean for me,

983
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:19,704
my talks are really,
they're an attempt to explore a set of 

984
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:25,030
ideas in the most truthful way that I 
can manage.

985
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:25,863
And that's also an adventure because 
letting yourself speak freely about a 

986
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:31,504
topic,
you don't always know where it's going 

987
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:32,920
to go.
And so,

988
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,890
but that also hooks in the audience 
because they're not,

989
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,840
they're along for the ride,
right?

990
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,540
And there's a risk.
Risk is you might forget where you are,

991
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:43,120
you might lose the thread.
You might say something you regret,

992
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,180
you might get confused.
And it's this,

993
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,060
the talk should be a process of 
exploration,

994
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,580
like a journey that you're taking the 
audience along on.

995
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,470
It's the same when you're reading a 
novel,

996
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:58,471
like a great novel isn't exactly plotted
out from beginning to end to begin with.

997
00:56:59,110 --> 00:56:59,943
The author is taking himself or herself 
and you on an intellectual adventure 

998
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:07,024
through the,
through the character development and 

999
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,740
the characters have to be allowed to 
live and to express themselves.

1000
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:12,574
And the novel needs to unfold.
It's like a color coy between the 

1001
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,060
conscious mind and the unconscious 
source of inspiration.

1002
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:23,350
And the novel is actually a journey 
through a character,

1003
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:27,190
a logical landscape.
And the author's shouldn't know where he

1004
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:29,200
or she is going to end up at the 
beginning.

1005
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,920
Same with an artist and who's,
who's writing a song or,

1006
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,560
or,
or a piece of music or a piece of visual

1007
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:36,394
art.
There has to be play and exploration 

1008
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,370
along the way.
And so you also don't want to deliver an

1009
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:46,060
overprepared talk in my estimation,
or at least that's not how I do it.

1010
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:46,894
You want to have a theme,
you want to have a body of knowledge 

1011
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:50,164
from which you can draw on.
And then you want to be actively 

1012
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:54,850
exploring the idea in front of the 
audience.

1013
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,880
And that's very gripping for everyone,
including you.

1014
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,833
And so,
and you should learn something from the 

1015
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:00,844
talk.
It's an opportunity to think on your 

1016
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,030
feet.
And anyways,

1017
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,860
that's my style of lecturing.

1018
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,270
Um,
it's,

1019
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,200
it's a trapeze act without a safety net,
I would say.

1020
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,034
And that's part of what makes it 
gripping is that there's a high 

1021
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:15,904
probability of failure.
And I would say with any performance 

1022
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,500
that's going to be
gripping,

1023
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,043
that on the edge of the seat gripping,
there has to be a high probability of 

1024
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,970
failure.
And that's why I don't speak with notes.

1025
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,400
Um,
if you speak with notes,

1026
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,770
which you might have to,
if you're a beginning speaker,

1027
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,090
then you can not fail because you can 
always read the notes.

1028
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,590
And so there's a,
there's a nap,

1029
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,420
you'll fall in the net,
but you won't die,

1030
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,610
but you'll never do anything 
spectacular.

1031
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,420
So that's the thing is if you're going 
to do something spectacular,

1032
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:52,030
you have to take the risk.
And if you're going to take the risk,

1033
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,790
you have to think on your feet.
And then you also have to have something

1034
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:55,330
to think about.

1035
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,310
You have to be,
have been working on this material.

1036
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:58,144
You know,
I've been working on this stuff I talk 

1037
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,920
about for 30 years,
for tens of thousands of hours.

1038
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,910
And so I have that reservoir of 
knowledge.

1039
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,080
I suppose that,
you know,

1040
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:08,914
whenever I read something new,
I'm slotting it into the node structure 

1041
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:12,484
that I use to generate my talks and I'm 
reading all the time and lots of the 

1042
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:17,980
things I read,
I forget.

1043
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,500
They're not relevant to my central 
mission,

1044
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,770
whatever that happens to be.
It looks like some,

1045
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,683
it looks something like the delineation 
of the relationship between 

1046
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:27,914
responsibility and meaning and,
and maybe responsibility meaning and 

1047
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,140
perception.
It's something like that.

1048
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:37,400
And so I have a central concern or 
deeper than that in some sense.

1049
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:38,853
Um,
my central concern was how do ensure 

1050
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:47,171
personally that if I was tempted in a 
situation like the situations that arose

1051
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:49,034
in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,
that I wouldn't fall prey to those 

1052
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:57,920
totalitarian systems and act in the 
reprehensible manner that so many people

1053
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:58,754
act at the end.

1054
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,070
That's really been a driving concern of 
mine.

1055
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,233
And,
and that's bleeds over into the 

1056
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:06,530
relationship between meaning and 
responsibility and perception.

1057
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,603
So there's a core set of problems that 
I'm working on in every talk is an 

1058
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,880
attempt to further develop those.
So you also have to have a problem.

1059
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,180
You know,
you think,

1060
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,680
well you don't want to have a problem.
It's like,

1061
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,281
yeah,
you do,

1062
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,250
you want to,
you want to,

1063
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,840
you've got problems anyways.
If you're alive,

1064
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,670
you've got problems.
Pick one of them.

1065
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,890
It can be your problem and that can be 
the problem.

1066
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,380
You try to address whatever that happens
to be.

1067
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,300
And then you have something to talk 
about.

1068
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:35,480
How am I going to address this problem?
How can this problem be addressed?

1069
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,213
So you need to have a problem too.
If you're going to talk just like you 

1070
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:39,614
need to have a problem if you're going 
to write because the writing is an 

1071
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:43,940
attempt to solve the problem.
And so is there talking.

1072
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,360
If you're not trying to solve a problem,
what the hell are you doing talking?

1073
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:51,290
Why should anyone care?
It's got to be a real problem to like,

1074
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,370
uh,
you know,

1075
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,250
a nail biter of a problem,
a dragon have a problem.

1076
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,280
And if it's a problem that everyone else
shares so much,

1077
01:00:58,281 --> 01:00:59,930
the better.
So,

1078
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,420
and then you grapple with it.
So

1079
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:10,863
thoughts on the eastern idea of moving 
away from excessive thinking into the 

1080
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,190
awareness beyond thinking,
removing it from the driver's seat to be

1081
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:20,320
used more as a tool?
Yeah,

1082
01:01:20,321 --> 01:01:24,040
well I thought a lot about this in 
relationship to

1083
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:29,470
a couple of ancient ideas.
The one Mesopotamia and idea,

1084
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,130
a characterization of Marduk who was the
highest Mesopotamian Daddy.

1085
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,673
All right.
It was Marta who carved up the goddess 

1086
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:38,944
of chaos,
Tie Amat into pieces and made the world 

1087
01:01:42,311 --> 01:01:43,144
out of her pieces.
So Martech is the force that confronts 

1088
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:49,780
chaos and builds habitable order,
like the logos in genesis.

1089
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,890
And one of Martex attributes was that he
had eyes all the way around his head and

1090
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:56,920
that he could speak magic words,
those two attributes,

1091
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,754
but it's the eyes they that are of most 
crucial importance with regard to this 

1092
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:02,860
question.
Then there's horus,

1093
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,730
the Egyptian God who's the famous I and 
horses,

1094
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:09,120
really a,
Oh,

1095
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,490
what a day of vacation of attention I 
would say.

1096
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:15,640
And there's a difference between 
attention and thinking.

1097
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,310
Like let,
let me give you an example.

1098
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:23,311
So thinking to be instrumental mostly so
if your thing,

1099
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,250
but people also often say to me,
well what's your,

1100
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,980
what's your strategy when you go into an
interview?

1101
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,190
And the answer is,
well,

1102
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,620
I don't have a strategy when I go into 
an interview because I'm there to have a

1103
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,454
conversation and I'm not sure where the 
conversation will go and I'm willing to 

1104
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,490
let it go wherever it goes.
I'm not there to sell books,

1105
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,890
although I'm perfectly happy if more 
books sell because,

1106
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,023
well,
because obviously I wrote a book and I 

1107
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,890
want people to read it and there's a 
whole enterprise behind it.

1108
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,950
And so it's also my responsibility to do
the marketing properly.

1109
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:56,860
But I'm not going to do these interviews
to sell books or to promote myself or,

1110
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:57,883
or I don't have a strategic goal in mind
except that I'm going to have a 

1111
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:06,360
conversation and I'm going to say what I
think and,

1112
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,223
and,
and take the consequences because I 

1113
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:12,420
assumed that if I say something and I 
believe it's true,

1114
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,254
then the consequences are as positive as
they can be regardless of how they look 

1115
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:17,304
at the time.

1116
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,503
And that's an issue of faith because I 
believe that the habitable order is 

1117
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:26,130
generated by spoken truth.
I believe that.

1118
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:28,770
I think that's the truest,
that's the truest thing.

1119
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,170
I know.
And so,

1120
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,193
and so I go into the interview and I did
this in my clinical practice and I try 

1121
01:03:37,631 --> 01:03:39,300
to do this when I'm talking to people 
too,

1122
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:40,134
is that I'm not thinking about where the
conversation is going or what point I 

1123
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:46,080
want to make or what I want the outcome 
to be.

1124
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:47,760
Any of that.
I just let that go.

1125
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,463
You know,
it's within this broader framework of 

1126
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:51,324
assuming that the truth is the most 
effective means of progressing and then 

1127
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:56,334
I pay attention.
And what happens when you pay attention 

1128
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,294
is that while you're watching a person,
this is a great treatment for social 

1129
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:04,680
anxiety,
by the way,

1130
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:05,514
because if you're socially anxious,
you tend not to pay attention to the 

1131
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:07,770
person.

1132
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:11,340
Pay attention to who you're talking to.
Watch them like a hawk,

1133
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,263
like not paranoid or anything like that,
and not too intently because you make 

1134
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:15,864
them uncomfortable but intently.
Pay attention to what they're saying to 

1135
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:23,370
how they look to their facial gestures,
all of that look at their face and watch

1136
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:26,910
and listen and try to understand what 
they're saying.

1137
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:29,910
And what you'll see is that,
well questions pop into your mind.

1138
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:30,331
It's like,
well,

1139
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:32,580
I didn't understand what you said.
Can you clarify that?

1140
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:35,310
And it sounds like you mean this is this
what you mean?

1141
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,090
But not in a,
I'll put you on the spot because I think

1142
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:39,924
you're wrong sort of way,
but in a clarification sort of way and 

1143
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:46,800
all of that attention.
And so what I'm doing clinical work with

1144
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,200
people,
and this is the reason I quit by the way

1145
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,900
about a year ago is because I was 
starting to get distracted.

1146
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:52,733
I had a rule which was,
you have an hour with me and I do 

1147
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,314
nothing but pay attention to you.
I'm not thinking about what I wanted to 

1148
01:04:58,641 --> 01:04:59,474
accomplish.
I'm not thinking about the problems in 

1149
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,030
my life.
I'm not distracted.

1150
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,450
And I listened to you and I ask 
questions when I don't understand.

1151
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,160
And if a thought,
oh,

1152
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:10,470
occurs to me while I'm paying attention 
to you,

1153
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:13,920
then I'll tell you what it is you see.
And that's,

1154
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,160
that's using awareness primarily 
thinking secondarily like I don't think,

1155
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,083
well here's what I,
how I want to cure this person and I'm 

1156
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:24,784
going to maneuver them into certain 
responses by using these communicative 

1157
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:30,154
tools.
I think I'm going to pay attention to 

1158
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:34,900
this person.
We're going to discuss where we're going

1159
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:37,360
and why I'm going to listen to what they
say.

1160
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:41,350
And then when they're talking things are
going to occur within me.

1161
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,183
I'm going to see images and thoughts are
going to emerge from the background and 

1162
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:48,664
then I'll share them.
Not always because I usually have more 

1163
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:52,924
thoughts than can be shared.
But if a thought comes up and it seems 

1164
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,960
like an interesting reaction to what the
person just said,

1165
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:03,010
then I'll just tell them and sort of 
without commitment to it.

1166
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:03,903
And it's usually okay,
you just said this and so this question 

1167
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:08,980
emerged so we need to straighten that 
out cause I'm,

1168
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:12,760
I'm confused.
Or You said this and I had this image or

1169
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:17,761
you said this and this thought came to 
mind and it seems to be this is this.

1170
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,393
So that's one person's reaction to the 
way that you're conducting yourself at 

1171
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,510
the moment.
So,

1172
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:27,590
okay,

1173
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,870
thinking is instrumental.
I outline this in,

1174
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,260
I think it's rule seven,
do what is meaningful,

1175
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,770
not what is expedient.
If you do what's expedient,

1176
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:37,604
you have a short term conscious goal in 
mind and you try to bend everything 

1177
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:41,894
towards that end.
But if you're pursuing what's 

1178
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:45,344
meaningful,
then you just pay attention to what's 

1179
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:52,391
going on and you react with truth.
And I think that's,

1180
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,070
that's a much better way of living as 
far as I'm concerned.

1181
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,950
It's,
it's a much more powerful way of living.

1182
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:02,660
It means you have to confront things 
right then in there,

1183
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:06,830
which is I suppose why so many of my 
interviews have been,

1184
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:12,040
in some sense contra confrontational 
because people will impose in,

1185
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,953
uh,
thinking agenda on the flow of the 

1186
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:15,314
conversation.
This is especially true in the 

1187
01:07:16,371 --> 01:07:17,204
mainstream media happened again recently
with bbcs hard talk that they impose an 

1188
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:25,580
agenda on the conversation.
And then that just doesn't work out very

1189
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:26,414
well because

1190
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:32,660
I'm paying attention and I will object 
to the agenda.

1191
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,360
Not because I haven't different agenda 
except for what I said,

1192
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:43,361
which is that I want to say what I think
I want to say as truthfully as I can.

1193
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:44,294
What I actually am thinking in this more
abstracted and detached sense and see 

1194
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:53,920
what happens.
So it's,

1195
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,920
it's a hard thing to clarify because you
might say,

1196
01:07:57,921 --> 01:07:58,754
well Dr. Peterson,
you just said you want to say what 

1197
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:05,090
you're thinking,
but it's not exactly the same thing.

1198
01:08:05,091 --> 01:08:07,610
It's not like I'm thinking 
strategically,

1199
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,100
I'm listening.
Thoughts emerge and I say them.

1200
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:16,880
I'm not trying to,
I'm not putting a spin on things.

1201
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:19,760
I'm not trying to manipulate the 
conversation any particular way.

1202
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:23,720
And again,
the reason for that is because I decided

1203
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,580
a long time ago,
probably 30 years that there was no more

1204
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:29,414
effective way of dealing with a complex 
situation than to try to say what you 

1205
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:36,470
believe to be true and know how to 
manipulate it.

1206
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:37,311
No,
none of that.

1207
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:38,144
It's just doesn't cause that's all,
those are all lies as far as I'm 

1208
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:42,080
concerned,
that kind of manipulation and spin.

1209
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,513
So
if he was invited to the largest 

1210
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,023
possible number of games is also the 
person that goes out to conquer the 

1211
01:08:56,551 --> 01:08:59,430
unknown.
Could this lie and reciprocal altruism?

1212
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,480
That's a really good question.
I would say it almost certainly does.

1213
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,040
You certainly see the reciprocal 
altruism in being invited to the largest

1214
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,750
possible number of games.
So a little background here,

1215
01:09:12,751 --> 01:09:13,231
it's like,
well,

1216
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:16,050
what's a winner?
Or a winner is someone who wins a game.

1217
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,123
It's like no.
A winner is someone who gets invited to 

1218
01:09:19,411 --> 01:09:21,930
play the largest possible number of 
games.

1219
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,510
And that means that you have to be a 
good sport.

1220
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:28,200
And so the good sport is the winner in 
the broader game in the metagame.

1221
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,453
Now I put forward the proposition that 
the winner of the Meta game is also the 

1222
01:09:33,901 --> 01:09:36,060
person that goes out to conquer the 
unknown.

1223
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,180
Now let's see if we can take that apart 
a little bit.

1224
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:40,740
Well,
one of the,

1225
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,950
one of the attributes of being a good 
sport,

1226
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:44,784
let's say,
is that you're trying to extend your 

1227
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:47,634
skill during the game and so you are 
confronting the unknown in the game 

1228
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,010
because you're trying to get better at 
playing the game.

1229
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:56,730
And then you're also doing that in a way
that's of benefit to the team.

1230
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,360
And so then you can imagine that being a
team leader in,

1231
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,383
in the metagame,
which is the game of extending your 

1232
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:03,774
skill across the,
across the broadest possible set of 

1233
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:09,750
games is analogous to leading a team 
into the unknown.

1234
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,450
So if you're going to go confront the 
unknown,

1235
01:10:12,451 --> 01:10:13,980
you're probably not going to do it 
alone,

1236
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,340
although you could.
And to some degree you have to be alone,

1237
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:21,330
but you're generally going to do it in a
cooperative and competitive way.

1238
01:10:21,331 --> 01:10:25,110
I mean that's why stories like the Lord 
of the rings and the Hobbit for example,

1239
01:10:25,111 --> 01:10:28,800
and even Harry Potter for that matter,
none of those people are alone.

1240
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:29,813
They,
they lead or are part of a broader 

1241
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:36,750
social group and they're important and 
they're team players within that group.

1242
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,123
So the team player element seems to be 
something that's common to conquering 

1243
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:44,280
the unknown and to reciprocal altruism 
and,

1244
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,860
and to being invited to play the largest
number of games.

1245
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:51,000
And the question then is what makes an 
effective leader and an effective leader

1246
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:55,860
is someone who is able to synthesize the
group and to lead it forward towards the

1247
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:56,820
goal.
Yeah,

1248
01:10:56,821 --> 01:10:57,840
that's it.
And you know,

1249
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:01,500
when a game,
obviously the good player is leading the

1250
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:04,900
team forward to the goal.
And it's the same in a quest.

1251
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:08,820
The good player is the leader who's 
leading the team towards the goal.

1252
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:12,420
So there's a,
there's a deep analogy there and

1253
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,813
it's not just reciprocal altruism.
I don't think that's quite the right 

1254
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:24,560
terminology though,
because there's an element of pragmatic

1255
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,400
competence that goes along with it to 
you.

1256
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:33,960
You are,
you can't merely be willing to engage in

1257
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:36,300
reciprocal altruism,
to be a good player

1258
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,063
or to conquer the unknown.
You also have to have skill and 

1259
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,004
discipline.
So I would say reciprocal altruism is 

1260
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,040
necessary but not sufficient 
precondition,

1261
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,710
right?
Talent,

1262
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,210
scalability,
all of those things,

1263
01:11:52,211 --> 01:11:55,480
our creativity,
all of those things are also important.

1264
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,180
So
that's a bit of an answer to that,

1265
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,530
but it's very,
very good question.

1266
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,113
So please confirm.
If you're a Harry Potter patroness 

1267
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,260
patronus would in fact be a frog?
We need answers,

1268
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:12,210
doctor.
Well,

1269
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:15,910
you'd certainly think that wouldn't you
frog?

1270
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,680
Well,
I think that's obvious.

1271
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:22,681
It's gotta be a frog or maybe a lobster.
I wouldn't have,

1272
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,350
I wouldn't have guessed that it would be
a frog,

1273
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:30,200
but that certainly seems to be how 
things have developed.

1274
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,450
And I suppose,
you know,

1275
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:38,890
a frog is in home at home,
on dry land and in the water

1276
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,013
and

1277
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,553
that makes the frog a kind of psychopomp
and I've strived to be at home in the 

1278
01:12:49,781 --> 01:12:54,730
air and in the water and to bring up the
gold ball from the bottom of the lake.

1279
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,230
Like the frog.
Prince.

1280
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,640
Yeah,
yeah,

1281
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,500
definitely frog.
Okay,

1282
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:02,670
so you've got your answer.

1283
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,533
MMM.

1284
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,060
Well,
I've got my answer too.

1285
01:13:07,061 --> 01:13:10,630
I guess
on completing,

1286
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,080
understand myself.com I scored 
exceptionally low,

1287
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:17,170
zero and conscientiousness,
industriousness and orderliness.

1288
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,960
What can I do for motivation?
Well,

1289
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:22,180
Dean,
the first question is how old are you?

1290
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:23,470
And,
uh,

1291
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,380
you're going to have an easier life if 
you're still young.

1292
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,840
Because if you're older and you have 
that score,

1293
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:31,280
then that's going to be rough.
Um,

1294
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,273
perhaps you're high in openness,
in which case you're going to derive 

1295
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:39,790
your motivation from engaging in 
creative endeavors.

1296
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,833
Perhaps you're high in agreeableness,
which means that you might find meaning 

1297
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:46,630
and caring for other people,
perhaps extroversion,

1298
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:50,320
which means you're going to find 
engagement in being with other people.

1299
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,780
Um,
so,

1300
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:55,180
so those are potential sources of 
motivation.

1301
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,270
You may have to look elsewhere then 
duty,

1302
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:59,283
let's say.
And it chievemeet ambition for your 

1303
01:14:01,931 --> 01:14:02,764
primary sources of motivation.
One thing I would caution you though is 

1304
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:09,820
that you likely need to make friends 
with the scheduler.

1305
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:10,654
Like Google,
try to design days you want to have and 

1306
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:18,190
to learn to structure your time because

1307
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,120
okay,

1308
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,150
even if you're high in openness,
which makes you creative,

1309
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,193
it's,
you're going to have a hell of a time 

1310
01:14:25,011 --> 01:14:25,844
sticking to things.
And so maybe you need to partner with 

1311
01:14:30,021 --> 01:14:32,810
someone who's I in conscientiousness.
Um,

1312
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,410
but I would really recommend trying to 
discipline yourself.

1313
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,250
You use,
uh,

1314
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,083
use Google calendar to design the days 
you want to have and learn to schedule 

1315
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:48,370
and regulate your time use because zero 
is very low and my suspicions are you'll

1316
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,790
pay quite a high price for that.
So

1317
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:56,653
what do you think about Ellis Miller and
her thesis that most psychological 

1318
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:02,480
diseases and the parent behavior as the 
result of some kind of childhood trauma?

1319
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,613
Some are,
but some forms of childhood trauma or 

1320
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:10,850
also a consequence of psychological 
diseases and apparent behavior.

1321
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,890
So this is very,
very complicated.

1322
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:13,963
Um,
I'm more on the existentialist front 

1323
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:16,874
with regards to these sorts of theory.
So Ellis Miller's thesis is basically 

1324
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,840
Freudian Freud's thesis.
Um,

1325
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,110
Freud,
uh,

1326
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,223
certainly posited that many forms of 
psychological distress where a 

1327
01:15:28,431 --> 01:15:31,790
consequence of childhood trauma of 
various sorts.

1328
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,013
Um,

1329
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,810
I think the existentialist take on that 
is more accurate,

1330
01:15:36,811 --> 01:15:37,644
which is that life in and of itself is 
sufficiently harsh and full of betrayal 

1331
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:48,240
and other forms of malevolence to cause 
any number of psychological diseases and

1332
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:52,980
produce any amount of a barren behavior.
So I don't think it has to be,

1333
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:53,843
it's not as if we all had childhoods 
without trauma that we would have grown 

1334
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,770
up to be perfect adults.
Um,

1335
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:02,880
it's,
that's also a disguised form of Rousseau

1336
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,480
Indian philosophy and the Russo's 
philosophy is people are basically good,

1337
01:16:06,481 --> 01:16:10,500
but culture makes them evil and that's 
not true.

1338
01:16:10,501 --> 01:16:13,830
People are basically good and evil and 
culture,

1339
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,053
um,
fortifies the possibility of both add 

1340
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:20,940
strength to the possibility of both.
So,

1341
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,680
um,
I don't,

1342
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:23,543
I th I think that people are sometimes 
damaged in childhood in ways that need 

1343
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:31,770
to be addressed in adulthood,
but that there are plenty,

1344
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:36,210
plenty of other reasons for 
psychological and physical disorder.

1345
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,850
Genetic causes,

1346
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,180
uh,
uh,

1347
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:46,370
causes related to all sorts of physical 
diseases.

1348
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,140
No,
it's way too simple.

1349
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,430
It's way too simple.
A,

1350
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,483
um,
a hypothesis and it's caused an awful 

1351
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:56,510
lot of trouble because a lot of simple 
minded therapists always assumed that if

1352
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,750
someone is having psychological problems
in adulthood,

1353
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:00,584
it must be because they had childhood 
trauma and everybody has an unhappy 

1354
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:06,380
childhood to some degree.
So you can always find something.

1355
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:10,250
And often the childhood trauma that 
they're looking for house to be sexual.

1356
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,233
And so they dig and dig until they find 
or invent often invent something that 

1357
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:17,923
you know,
allows a single causal attribution and 

1358
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,580
it's just life just isn't that simple 
man.

1359
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,473
There's lots of reasons to be ill,
way more reasons to be old and to be 

1360
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:27,590
healthy.
So

1361
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,450
what if the truth could unravel your 
entire life?

1362
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:36,350
Yeah.
Well first of all it would and second,

1363
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:37,520
yeah,
I know what you mean.

1364
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,713
You mean what if I suppose that a 
cardinal case there would be that you 

1365
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:43,514
did something really terrible and that 
if that was revealed it would be a 

1366
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:50,930
catastrophic situation.
It's like without knowing the details of

1367
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:53,300
that,
I can't provide a generic answer.

1368
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,493
You know,
I think that there are some sins that 

1369
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:59,930
are so egregious that you don't get to 
confess to them.

1370
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:02,030
You know?
Like if you've done something terrible,

1371
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,970
and I'm not recommending this,
it's just an example.

1372
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:05,804
If you've done something terrible and 
you know that if you revealed and it 

1373
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:10,970
would blow the lives of many people 
around you apart,

1374
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,013
it isn't obvious to me that you have any
moral justification for confessing just 

1375
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:18,344
to free your miserable soul.
So what if the truth could unravel your 

1376
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,264
entire life?
Or maybe you need to go to Catholic 

1377
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:27,320
confession and let someone know exactly 
what happened.

1378
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:28,154
So you're clear about it then.
Then maybe what you need to do is to 

1379
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:33,830
swear to whatever God you worship that 
you're going to try to walk the straight

1380
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:34,664
and narrow from here on in.
And that'll be sufficient to atone for 

1381
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,910
whatever terrible thing that you did.
And that's a,

1382
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,893
that's a form of prayer.
And it sounds like one that you 

1383
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,460
desperately need,
at least in principle.

1384
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,253
No.
So

1385
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,760
without knowing the details,
that's about the best I can do.

1386
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,473
I think what put you over with so many 
of us was the constructive message of 

1387
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:05,110
how to be a good man.
Well,

1388
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:08,670
a good person I would say.
Do you think that's where the media want

1389
01:19:08,671 --> 01:19:10,410
you to go?
I don't know.

1390
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:11,363
Generally not day.
I mentioned this earlier is that the 

1391
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:15,714
media as it disintegrates and it 
certainly is disintegrating at an 

1392
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,670
incredibly rapid rate.
Um,

1393
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,403
everything is political there.
It's as if the philosophical and the 

1394
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:29,070
psychological and the theological don't 
exist.

1395
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,233
And you know,
increasingly in my interviews I've been 

1396
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,103
talking about what's been happening at 
my lectures on my tour and describing 

1397
01:19:37,351 --> 01:19:38,184
the fact that the vast majority of the 
audience isn't there for political 

1398
01:19:41,101 --> 01:19:41,934
reasons at all.
They were there because they want to 

1399
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,560
figure out how to have a responsible and
meaningful life.

1400
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,740
And it's as if that story just doesn't 
exist.

1401
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:50,410
The,
the,

1402
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,610
the framework,
which is basically a political framework

1403
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:55,710
and increasingly a politically correct 
framework,

1404
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,040
doesn't allow that to exist as a 
reality.

1405
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,580
And that's why,
well,

1406
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,863
I'm much more comfortable lecturing to 
the crowds that have been coming to see 

1407
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:11,280
me than I am talking to journalists.
It's become,

1408
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,650
I have to,
I have been limiting my,

1409
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:14,663
my interactions with journalists,
even though that might not be self 

1410
01:20:17,221 --> 01:20:19,140
evident yet.
I have been trying to do that,

1411
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,573
that the demands have been increasing.
So the proportion of media invitations 

1412
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:30,090
that I've responding to has fallen 
dramatically,

1413
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:34,260
even though the absolute number hasn't 
declined as precipitously.

1414
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,660
And the reason for that is that while I 
find the,

1415
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:40,380
I find the typical interview very 
stressful,

1416
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,640
very,
very stressful.

1417
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:42,863
I'm on guard.
And I would say also my attitude isn't 

1418
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:48,000
as good as it could be any more because 
I've been,

1419
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,760
I'm,
because I'm on guard so much,

1420
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:55,200
it's easier for me to get a bit snappy 
and an unpleasant and that's bad.

1421
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,760
That's bad.
I don't want to do that.

1422
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:00,060
I want to stay calm and detached and try
to,

1423
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:01,523
you know,
tell the truth and be happy that I'm 

1424
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:06,130
there regardless of the circumstances.
Um,

1425
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:11,210
the fact that the mainstream media,
let's say is not very receptive,

1426
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,543
although sometimes there's exceptions,
not very receptive to the idea that I 

1427
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:19,554
could just be going around talking to 
people who want to get their life 

1428
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:25,800
together is quite saddening.
And I think it's definitely a commentary

1429
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:29,790
on the fundamental corruption of our 
media apparatus.

1430
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,953
Um,

1431
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:36,963
I think it's better to talk on youtube,
to speak on my podcast to do these 

1432
01:21:40,991 --> 01:21:41,824
lectures.
And I think it's increasingly better to 

1433
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:45,094
do that.
The long form discussions on youtube 

1434
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:49,850
though with people like Joe Rogan and 
Dave Rubin and,

1435
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,510
and so forth,
that works just fine.

1436
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:53,883
So the new media form is emerging and I 
think it's going to be a lot more 

1437
01:21:58,391 --> 01:21:59,460
productive.
Um,

1438
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,020
it won't be a scripted,
it'll be much longer forum.

1439
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:04,450
It'll be allow for much more 
thoughtfulness.

1440
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,930
Um,
and

1441
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,283
I'm,

1442
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,410
but it's okay.
It's not like the media exposure,

1443
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:18,710
although it's been stressful.
It's not like I'm not grateful for it.

1444
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,953
Even people who've put me on the spot 
very badly have ended up doing me a 

1445
01:22:23,811 --> 01:22:26,510
tremendous favor.
But the problem is,

1446
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:27,344
is that because
the problem is I'm becoming too much on 

1447
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:36,020
garden and I've noticed,
uh,

1448
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,700
developing sense of impatience,
um,

1449
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,160
within me and some suspicion and that's 
not good.

1450
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,850
I don't want to be in situations where 
those are my fundamental orientation.

1451
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,810
It's it,
it's a,

1452
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,050
it's a sign of a certain amount of 
internal corruption on my part.

1453
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,573
And,
uh,

1454
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:56,900
I want to be in situations where I'm 
speaking with people,

1455
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,780
speaking honestly to people who are 
honestly listening.

1456
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,390
That would be,
that's a good situation.

1457
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:03,523
So

1458
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,630
would you agree with Cs Lewis?
That if you look for truth,

1459
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:12,700
you may find comfort?
If you look for comfort,

1460
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,320
you will find despair.
Oh yes.

1461
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:17,680
That's definitely the case.
It's quite an intelligent phrase because

1462
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:18,940
he says,
if you look for truth,

1463
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:23,440
you may find comfort.
He didn't say you will find comfort.

1464
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,131
Yeah.
Well,

1465
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:26,920
sometimes if you look for truth,
you don't find comfort to begin with.

1466
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:28,720
That's for sure.
You find a lot of trouble,

1467
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,943
but sometimes you have to go through a 
lot of trouble to get to set things 

1468
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:34,540
right.
If you look for comfort,

1469
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:35,830
despair,
well,

1470
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:39,220
the reason for that is that you can't 
look for comfort in life.

1471
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:44,050
Life isn't about comfort.
Life is a deadly game.

1472
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,830
It's a game of life and death.
It's a game of good and evil.

1473
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:52,510
It's everything's on the line.
Your sanity's on the line,

1474
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,360
you're
your freedom from pain is on the line.

1475
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,370
Your freedom from despair is on the 
line,

1476
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:02,190
your family is on the line,
there's no comfort.

1477
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:06,690
Life is an adventure and I think the 
greatest adventure that you can possibly

1478
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:11,691
have is one is the one that you find if 
you look for the truth

1479
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:20,530
and that's a good place to start.
That's been 90 minutes and uh,

1480
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,840
I've been reasonably sharp and with it 
for the full 90 minutes.

1481
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,693
And so I think I'll bring it to a close.
Just a couple of reminders for those of 

1482
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:34,414
you who tuned in late,
if you want to try out the self 

1483
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:37,684
authoring program,
I made a code August and that an titles 

1484
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:44,260
you to 20% off.
There's a two for one special so you can

1485
01:24:44,261 --> 01:24:47,830
give it to a friend as well.
If you want to try to understand myself,

1486
01:24:47,831 --> 01:24:51,790
which is a personality test,
it only takes about 15 minutes.

1487
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,220
It's quite a bit easier than the self 
authoring suite.

1488
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:57,100
Um,
the code for that is also August.

1489
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,963
That also gives you 20% off.
Self authoring helps you write about 

1490
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:04,300
your past and present and future and you
can do a bad job.

1491
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:08,260
And if you haven't developed a life plan
and you don't know where you are and you

1492
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:11,650
don't know where you're going,
then I would highly recommend trying the

1493
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:12,100
program.

1494
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,300
And you're welcome to do a bad job at it
because a bad plan is,

1495
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,433
is a lot better than no plan at all.
And understand myself will help you 

1496
01:25:21,131 --> 01:25:23,170
understand who you are for better or 
worse.

1497
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:24,004
And,
and people have responded quite 

1498
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,104
positively to it.
So I think it's worth the 15 minutes in 

1499
01:25:28,811 --> 01:25:31,510
the nine 95 that it costs,
um,

1500
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:35,260
discounted 20% now.
So I guess that's about seven 95,

1501
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,450
something like that.
So that,

1502
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,493
um,
the second Iceland lecturer is going to 

1503
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:42,940
come out soon.
I released the first Iceland lecture,

1504
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:43,774
which is part of 12 rules for life.
I have a tour coming out through the 

1505
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:47,554
northeastern part of the United States 
starting in September and then over to 

1506
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:52,324
the UK and northern Europe in September 
and October and then Australia and New 

1507
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,400
Zealand in February.
Um,

1508
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:02,920
I've really enjoyed the tour.
I think it's an amazing opportunity.

1509
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:09,290
It's been extraordinarily heartwarming,
let's say,

1510
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,350
to talk to so many people who are trying
to put their lives together.

1511
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:13,184
And if enough people do that,
then they will put their lives together 

1512
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:17,840
and that will help put everything else 
together.

1513
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:19,041
And so,
uh,

1514
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,160
hopefully these q and a's are a smart,
small part of that.

1515
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:27,910
So thank you very much for listening in.
And I'll try to do one in September.

1516
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,110
Um,
if I don't,

1517
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:32,210
it's because I'm on the road all the 
time,

1518
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,550
but I will definitely try to do one in 
September.

1519
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:38,330
So thank you for,
to my patrion supporters.

1520
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,183
Um,
I mentioned to you guys that I am 

1521
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,073
working hard on the online university 
and have hired three people to work on 

1522
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,610
that and that we're,
we're about a year ahead of schedule,

1523
01:26:46,611 --> 01:26:47,444
I would say,
where I thought I'd be so in three 

1524
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:50,420
months were a year ahead of where I 
figured I'd be.

1525
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,950
We'd be.
So,

1526
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,870
um,
thanks again.

1527
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,580
Good night.
Ciao.
