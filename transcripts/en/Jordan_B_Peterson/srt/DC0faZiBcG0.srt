1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,980
So
today we're going to talk about you and

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,830
I find that tremendously entertaining.
Um,

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,620
uh,
I,

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm not sure I ever,
I've ever read anyone is intelligent as

5
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,840
you'll accept,
maybe need shift.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,363
Um,

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,830
it's funny,
he's accused of many things such as

8
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:31,210
starting a new religion by some rather
unscrupulous biographers.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,500
But what he did was actually far more
radical than anything he's ever been

10
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,050
accused of it.
One other thing I should tell you too is

11
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,130
young as often been accused of Anti
Semitism,

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,170
but one of the things that came to light
in last year was that he was working as

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:48,100
an agent for the American government
during World War II and frequently set

14
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:51,610
updates on Hitler psychological
condition to the highest levels of the

15
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,130
American government.
He never told anybody about that.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,060
So.
So,

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,930
you know,
that's a little hard on all accusations

18
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:00,280
of antisemitism,
I think,

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,580
which I've never thought had held any
merit anyways.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,340
So young.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,760
He was a strange guy in many ways,
extraordinarily imaginative.

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,410
He could get lost in daydreams and was a
tremendously powerful visualizer.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,420
And a lot of what he discovered
was a consequence of engaging in

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,430
longterm,
elaborated and fantasies and in these

25
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:46,961
fantasies he could have conversations
with figures of his imagination and

26
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
communicate with them.
I had a client at one point who was a

27
00:01:55,611 --> 00:02:00,611
very prolific dreamer and she can talk
to her characters in your dreams and ask

28
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:05,450
them what they meant symbolically and
they would tell her that was really

29
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:08,600
something.
I've only seen one person who who was

30
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,100
capable of doing that.
She was.

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,610
I don't know if it helped her that much
in the final analysis,

32
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,100
but she couldn't do it.
And young was very,

33
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:19,790
very interested in the depths of the
human imagination.

34
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:24,410
Now his
body of work

35
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,660
can be viewed as an amalgam of many
things,

36
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:34,520
but he.
He had deep knowledge of Latin and Greek

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,490
and he'd studied l chemical manuscripts
for many,

38
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:43,700
many years as an older man.
So he was very interested in the

39
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:47,450
emergence of the idea of science from
what he considered the collective

40
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,170
imagination.
But in many ways his primary modern

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:56,171
intellectual influences.
I would say we're Nietzsche and Freud

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,100
and you'll really set out some somewhat
like Piaget too,

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,390
address the gap between religion and
science,

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,450
but he did it for different reasons than
piaget.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,270
You'll took niches,
comments about the death of God very

46
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,450
seriously,
and one of the things need shape

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,900
predicted at the end of the 19th century
was that there were going to be two

48
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,860
major consequences of the collapse of
formal religious belief.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,200
He believed that that would lead people
to a morally relativistic condition that

50
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:39,910
would prove psychologically intolerable.
Because if you adopt a morally

51
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,210
relativist position and you take it to
its final conclusion,

52
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,430
then everything is of equal value and
there's no gradient between things.

53
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,380
There's no better,
no worse.

54
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,420
And in the final analysis,
you might say,

55
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,010
well,
there's no good and there's no evil.

56
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:58,840
And the problem with that is you can
actually orient yourself in a world that

57
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,290
has those properties.
Because in order to act as we've already

58
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,410
talked about with regards to the
cybernetic models,

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,650
you have to be aiming at something
that's better than what you have now.

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,080
Or there's no reason to expend the
energy.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,590
And so you need the gradient,
you need a value differentiation in

62
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,591
order to act and niches.
Analysis was predicated on the idea that

63
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:26,540
if the value hierarchy collapsed well,
not only would people not be motivated

64
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,900
to do anything anymore,
but they would also be extraordinarily

65
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:34,280
confused and depressed because the value
would go out of their life and the

66
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:38,000
consequence of that would be that they
would become somewhat nihilistic or

67
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:42,710
maybe absolutely nihilistic or that they
would turn to ideological rigid

68
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,860
ideological systems as a replacement.
Now,

69
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,694
what niche him

70
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,760
offered as an alternative to that was
that human beings could create their own

71
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:55,850
values,
and so his idea was that the superman,

72
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,280
the overmanned,
depending on how you look at it,

73
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,670
would be the person who was capable of
transcending the value list universe

74
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:10,991
that the decline of religion had left
with us and creating their own values as

75
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:16,001
a conscious act.
The problem with that is that it isn't

76
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:22,040
obvious that you can create your own
values as a conscious act because it's

77
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,650
not obvious that values are consciously
create it,

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,420
and I think this is why the
psychoanalysts had so much to add to the

79
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:33,170
philosophical debate,
at least the philosophical debate that

80
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,580
developed to the point of Nietzsche's
observations.

81
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,940
When Freud entered the scene,
the idea of the unconscious was in the

82
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:46,430
air,
but Freud formalized it to a much

83
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:51,020
greater degree than anyone else had,
and Freud's theory really is deeply

84
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:51,854
biological.

85
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,850
You know his,
his.

86
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,970
It's biological,
it's social as well,

87
00:05:55,971 --> 00:06:00,680
but his proposition proposition that
there is an id is fundamentally the

88
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:05,420
proposition that you're not necessarily
your consciousness for sure is not the

89
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,820
master in its own house.
Now,

90
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:11,690
I think part of the reason that people
like to go after Freud,

91
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,320
there's a variety of reasons,
but one of them is that modern people

92
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,820
basically accept radical Freud and
presuppositions more or less as givens.

93
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,430
Now you know,
and so if you're a brilliant thinker and

94
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:27,431
your thought permeates the society to
the point where your most radical

95
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:32,270
propositions are accepted by everyone,
all of it's really left or your errors,

96
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,940
and so it's easy to concentrate on
Freud's errors because we've already

97
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,380
digested everything he had to say.
That was particularly profound.

98
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,560
I mean,
I don't imagine perhaps I'm wrong,

99
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,570
but I don't imagine that there's anyone
in this room to whom the news that many

100
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:52,040
of your motivations aren't conscious
comes as a surprise.

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,220
I mean,
even psychologists have admitted that in

102
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,600
the last 20 years,
you know,

103
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,100
I mean,
they talk about the cognitive

104
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,810
unconscious with which I think is a real
slight of hand maneuver to stop them

105
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:06,380
from having to Credit Freud with his
discoveries.

106
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:09,920
And I also think that Freud's notion of
the unconscious is far more

107
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,330
sophisticated than the cognitive
scientists notion because Freud viewed

108
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:18,770
the unconscious as a place that was
basically populated by fragmented

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,880
personalities.
Not cognitive schemes of one form or

110
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,200
another.
Not Processes,

111
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,400
but things that were like living beings.
And you know,

112
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,220
when you think,
well,

113
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,340
are there living beings in your
unconscious and the answer to that is,

114
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,140
well,
are you alive or not?

115
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,350
And you're alive.
So you're composed of living

116
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,610
subcomponents and they're not machines,
or at least not in any way that we

117
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,070
understand machines.
They're fragmentary,

118
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:45,500
subpersonalities,
and each of them have their own

119
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,420
worldview and rationalizations and
emotional structure and goals.

120
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,350
And so that's why when you get hungry,
you see the world through the eyes of a

121
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:58,460
hungry person and you think thoughts
about food and your emotional reactions

122
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,250
depend on whether food is available or
whether it isn't,

123
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,310
and maybe whether or not the food you
want is available and whether it isn't

124
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,610
and you know,
that that's nature,

125
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,110
so to speak,
imposing its necessities on you as a

126
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,930
living being.
And for Freud,

127
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:19,460
that was the end and Freud thought of
the Ed really as something that was

128
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:23,870
primordial and primitive and he and,
and,

129
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,340
and that's one of the things that really
separated him from you.

130
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,920
And I think young is much more accurate
from,

131
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,840
uh,
from the perspective of evolutionary

132
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,980
psychology.
In fact,

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,340
I think he's radically underestimated as
a thinker whose thought was unbelievably

134
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,820
deeply grounded in biology and like
young was a remarkable person because

135
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,830
his notion of history and the
relationship between history and the

136
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:56,340
human psyche,
what covered spans time that we're

137
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,630
really,
until modern historians and evolutionary

138
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:04,770
psychologist started to talk about deep
time and the fact that you know,

139
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,390
the entire 4 billion year history of the
world is in some sense relevant to us

140
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,940
talk to us as beings or at least the 3
billion,

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,090
three point 5 billion year history that
there's been life on the planet.

142
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
Ancient history for European
philosophers was like 500 to 2000 years

143
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:26,361
ago and young thought way past that way
back farther than that and started to

144
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:31,080
take into serious account the fact that
are the origins of our psyche.

145
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,130
The ground of our psyche is deeply
biological and that it's an emergent

146
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,780
property.
So for Freud,

147
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,990
Freud's idea of the unconscious is
somewhat difficult to understand because

148
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,150
there's sort of two elements to it.
There's the ID,

149
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,540
which is the source of primordial
motivation and Freud concentrated mostly

150
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:50,880
on aggression and sexuality.
And the reason he concentrated on those

151
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,770
two,
although we concentrated on what he

152
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,810
called the death instinct later in his
life,

153
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,610
the reason he concentrated on those two
primarily wasn't because he regarded

154
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,390
them necessarily as the most compelling
of motivations,

155
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,070
but he regarded those motivations as the
ones that were most difficult for most

156
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:11,550
people to integrate successfully into
the social world.

157
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
So he thought that they were most likely
to be repressed and therefore under

158
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,120
developed and immature.
And I think that's.

159
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,700
I think that's a reasonable proposition.
I think that modern people would have to

160
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:31,380
add eating to that because since the
time of Freud we've gone,

161
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,410
I would say from a high proportion of
sexually related pathologies to a very,

162
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,870
very high proportion of eating related
pathologies.

163
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,810
But that's in some sense beside the
point.

164
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,020
So that's one part of the Freudian
unconscious,

165
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,770
sort of an implicit unconscious.
Then the other part of the Freudian

166
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:54,420
unconscious is those things that have
happened to you that you've repressed

167
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,650
because you don't like what they imply.

168
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,380
And you know,
those are very different kinds of

169
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:05,080
unconscious because one of them is
dependent on your experience.

170
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,170
And the other isn't,
and you could think of young actually as

171
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,070
a,
a,

172
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,430
a deep archeologist of the ID
and Freud,

173
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,600
Freud thought about the and sort of
primordial terms.

174
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:20,870
So his,
his angry id would be,

175
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,060
you know,
like a beast that's out of control.

176
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,050
But you
recognize that the unconscious was far

177
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:38,411
more sophisticated in many ways than the
conscious parts of your being and that

178
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:44,630
it guided your adaptation in ways that
you didn't understand

179
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,350
and that those,
the ways in which had guarded your

180
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,360
adaptation and structured your
understanding,

181
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:55,361
we're universal hands,
biological and

182
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,360
far more sophisticated than a somewhat
primordial notion of biological drive

183
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,433
might indicate.

184
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,773
So

185
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,540
one of the things that you might
consider,

186
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,850
for example,
is that from the union perspective,

187
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,380
a lot of the forces that ancient people
consider diabetes.

188
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,383
We're

189
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,130
personified representations of
instinctual systems.

190
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,330
So,
hey,

191
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,610
here's a way of thinking about it,
and this is the way of thinking about

192
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:31,210
the collective unconscious,
which is humans in some sense,

193
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,730
young's replacement term for the fraud
and ID.

194
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,770
So Mars,
for example,

195
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,130
is the god of war,
Roman God of war.

196
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,100
And you might say,
well,

197
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:46,570
what does it mean for there to be a god
of war?

198
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,550
And the answer or Venus is the god of
love actually,

199
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:50,210
of,
of,

200
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,340
of sexual attraction,
more particularly,

201
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,110
or have sexual possession,
which is even a better way of thinking

202
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,720
about it.
And you say,

203
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,970
well,
why would people conceptualize of those

204
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,430
phenomena as gods?
The Greek set,

205
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:09,410
for example,
that human beings were the play things

206
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,370
of the gods.
No,

207
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,810
that's what Shakespeare.
I'm sorry,

208
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:12,960
that was Shakespeare who said that?

209
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,300
Well,
here's one way of thinking about it.

210
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,050
What's older you or aggression?
Now answer to that is,

211
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,720
well,
you're 23 and the system that mediates

212
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,750
biological aggression in mammals and
their progenitors is tens of millions of

213
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,950
years old and if you think you control
it rather than the other way around,

214
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,370
you're diluted about your central
nature.

215
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,300
Part of it,
part of it is that you don't control it

216
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:50,360
at all.
What happens is that you never go

217
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:54,650
anywhere where you need to use it.
And so one of the things that happens to

218
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:56,420
soldiers in war time,
for example,

219
00:13:56,421 --> 00:14:01,190
is they go somewhere where they could
use it and out it comes and the

220
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:05,120
consequence of its emergencies,
so traumatic that they develop

221
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,330
posttraumatic stress disorder because
they observe themselves doing things

222
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:12,320
that are hyper aggressive that they
could have never imagined that someone

223
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:16,510
like them could have manifested.
And then you think,

224
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,490
well,
what about Venus as a goddess?

225
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,130
Well,
if you fall in love with someone

226
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,670
who,
who

227
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,700
is that a choice?
It doesn't look like a choice.

228
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,430
If it's a choice,
it's often an incredibly self

229
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:35,431
destructive and idiotic choice and it's
often one that ruins people's entire

230
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:39,100
lives.
It's more like a state of possession and

231
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:39,761
then you might say,
well,

232
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,380
possession by what?
Well,

233
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,000
it's a dynamic living system and it's
also immortal in some sense,

234
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,730
which is another reason why
conceptualizing it as a daddy makes

235
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:52,730
sense,
mean the phenomena of love,

236
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,290
which is the manifestation of our
complex biological system,

237
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,220
will be alarm long,
will be around long after you're gone

238
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:06,221
and was there long before you showed up.
And when it manifests itself,

239
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:11,240
so to speak within you,
you're possessed by it and you do its

240
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:15,800
bidding and you may do its bidding
despite what you most deeply want.

241
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,570
You know,
modern people tend to think that the

242
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:25,571
conscious parts of their brain that say,
or let's say the more newly evolved

243
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,750
elements of their brain,
because we don't actually know what the

244
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:34,751
relationship is between consciousness
and the newly developed parts of the

245
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,950
brain.
The assumption is often made that the

246
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:41,951
reason we're conscious is because we've
developed a very spectacular cortical

247
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:46,280
cap,
but consciousness appears to be far

248
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,150
older than that.
So that's an erroneous assumption.

249
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,830
But we do tend to believe that the most
complex and sophisticated parts of our

250
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:58,880
brain are the cortical cap,
the complex cortical cap that's quite

251
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:03,650
enlarged in human beings relative to our
body size because it's the most.

252
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,770
It's the.
It's the newest systems and it's also

253
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:13,280
part of the systems that allow us to do
such things as communicate with language

254
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,200
and think in abstract symbols.
But there's a different way of thinking

255
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,120
about this from a biological
perspective,

256
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:24,470
and that is what makes you think the
newest system is the most sophisticated

257
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,890
one.
Why don't you assume that the oldest

258
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,300
system is the most sophisticated one
because it's been around for a while.

259
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:36,140
For example,
the mechanism in in your neurological,

260
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,510
the mechanism that underlies your
conception of your relationship to the

261
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,370
dominance hierarchy,
for example,

262
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,620
is at least 300 million years old and
the reason it's lasted 300 million years

263
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,771
is because it knows what it's doing
as far older than your parts of the

264
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:03,711
brain that make you conscious in the
specifically human way and it's so

265
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:07,230
deeply embedded in your brain in some
sense that you have almost no voluntary

266
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,300
control over it.
And that's why,

267
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,460
for example,
one of the things that happens to people

268
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:16,461
who are depressed is that the system
that reports their dominance,

269
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,260
dominance status

270
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,040
reports that they're low.
Now,

271
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,140
sometimes that's true because they're
not depressed.

272
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:29,170
They just have an awful life and they're
actually at the bottom of the dominance

273
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:30,730
hierarchy.
And that's not the same as being

274
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:33,530
depressed,
but sometimes it malfunctioned,

275
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:38,531
so someone who's competent and well
situated in life and who appears to have

276
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,770
everything that a person could possibly
desire in order to have a decent and

277
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:48,210
meaningful and positive life are still
catastrophic,

278
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,610
really depressed,
and what seems to happen in those

279
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,690
circumstances is that the dominance
counter for one reason or another,

280
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,040
is acting as if they're incredibly low
status when they're in fact not.

281
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,310
And I think that's a good definition of
clinical depression.

282
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,840
I also think that part of the reason
that there's mixed results with regards

283
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,130
to antidepressant trials is because
antidepressants don't help you if you're

284
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,900
at the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy.

285
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,520
Oh,
how good they.

286
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,540
You're not depressed.
You just have a terrible life that is

287
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,710
not the same thing and they need to be
carefully distinguished.

288
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:27,120
Because if you're unemployed and you're
facing the loss of your home and maybe

289
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,490
your partner's going to leave you and
your children hate you,

290
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,790
an antidepressant is very unlikely to
fix that.

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now to the degree that misbehavior on
your part called caused by impulsivity

292
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,410
and increased aggression and decreased
mood because of your reaction to that

293
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:48,300
circumstances is making it worse than
the antidepressant might help you and

294
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:52,350
maybe the antidepressant will help you
regain enough cognitive control so that

295
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,870
you can plan your way out of the
situation,

296
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,290
but as a medication in and of itself,
there's no possible way it can lift you

297
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:03,780
out of those often catastrophic,
complex and disintegrating

298
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:08,781
circumstances.
Whereas if your life is fine but you

299
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,100
feel terrible,
well,

300
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,070
it's much more likely that an
antidepressant can help with that

301
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,010
because in some sense,
what it's going to do is to readjust

302
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,500
your dominance,
the reporting of your dominance counter,

303
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,520
so to speak,
to the level that's appropriate for your

304
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,710
level of competence,
which is really what you want.

305
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,290
You know,
people say you should have high self

306
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,960
esteem.
I would say idiot say that you should

307
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,670
have high self esteem.
It's a.

308
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,671
it's an unbelievably corrupt construct
in many ways because it's actually very,

309
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,850
very highly correlated with baseline
levels of neuroticism negatively,

310
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,150
which is a fundamental personality
traits and baseline levels of

311
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,390
extroversion,
so someone with lower self esteem is

312
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,420
generally someone who's introverted and
has high levels of negative emotion.

313
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:54,660
It's a trait like phenomena.
It isn't clear at all that calling that

314
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,390
low self esteem has any utility
whatsoever,

315
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
but then you also might ask yourself,
well,

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,910
how much self esteem should you have?
Well,

317
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,720
that's a very complex question because
you can clearly have way too much.

318
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,990
That's what would make you a narcissist.
So I would say your self esteem should

319
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,390
be roughly equivalent to the esteem in
which your held by members of your

320
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,070
society.

321
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,720
You know your family and your society
because they're judging you,

322
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,670
at least in part on your competence and
you shouldn't think that you're more

323
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:30,450
competent than you are and you shouldn't
think that you're less competent than

324
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,940
you are.
You should think that you're as

325
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,810
competent as you are and sometimes that
means you're not competent at all

326
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,480
because you don't know what you're doing
and sometimes it means that you're quite

327
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:40,560
competent.
Now,

328
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:45,561
I think it's complicated by the fact
that you should also regard yourself not

329
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:49,120
only as who you are,
but as who you could be.

330
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,850
You know,
and so if you're of lowly dominant

331
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,850
status,
which for example in some sense you guys

332
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:58,000
are because you're young and you're
starting your lives,

333
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,640
the fact that there's a lot of potential
that you still are able to manifest

334
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,670
should tilt the self assessment balance
in your favor to a fair degree.

335
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,520
So
anyway,

336
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:18,380
so yoga was very interested in the
depths of the psyche and hit.

337
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:22,130
For him.
The unconscious wasn't a repository of

338
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,760
repressed experiences and it wasn't a
repository of underdeveloped and

339
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:33,671
irritated biological systems.
It was instead the underlying structure

340
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,140
of consciousness itself.
So you believe that human experience at

341
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,890
as it's consciously manifested,
was structured by underlying

342
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,350
patterns of behavior that were specific
and unique to to the,

343
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,860
to the human,
to human kind.

344
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:06,480
Although shared to some degree with
other animals and then on top of that a

345
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,930
realm of images stick and symbolic
representation,

346
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,680
that in part was
a consequence of representation of those

347
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,790
underlying behaviors.
So here's the way of thinking about it.

348
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,750
We act in a human way,
whatever that means,

349
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,490
and we'd been acting in a human way for
as long as there's been human beings and

350
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,670
we've been acting in a mammalian way for
as long as there's been mammals.

351
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,850
Now,
human beings are quite peculiar

352
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:40,380
creatures because not only do we act,
we also watch ourselves act and we

353
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:45,381
represent those actions and you unbelief
that as a consequence of

354
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,240
us manifesting

355
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,420
a specific set of typically human
behaviors over hundreds of thousands or

356
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:01,860
perhaps millions of years.
We also evolved the cognitive apparatus

357
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:06,510
that was capable of representing those
patterns of behavior and that cognitive

358
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:11,160
apparatus expressed the representations
of those fundamental patterns of

359
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:14,610
behavior in images,
stick and symbolic form,

360
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,810
and the basic images to can.
Symbolic form is something like drama.

361
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,910
Now,
why would that be?

362
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,630
Well,
it's.

363
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,540
It's obvious in some sense.
What is drama?

364
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,390
Drama is the representation,
the abstract representation of patterns

365
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:32,730
of behavior.
That's what you do when you go to a

366
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:36,090
movie,
you watch people manifest their

367
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,990
characteristic behaviors and then you
might know that there's.

368
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,910
Well,
there's characteristic

369
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,700
Kwanzaa,
unique of behavior that are portrayed in

370
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,950
drama.
So for example,

371
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:51,560
there's the bad guy and he wears the
black hat,

372
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,310
know a cowboy movie,
and whenever you go to a movie,

373
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,790
it's pretty clear to you right away who
the good guys are and the bad guys are,

374
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,500
and you accept the distinction between
good and bad guys as an a priority

375
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,880
acceptable distinction.

376
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,140
So you would say,
well,

377
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:09,800
that's the action of an archetype.
What underlies that is the archetypal

378
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:13,160
story of the hostile brothers and
hostile brothers,

379
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,870
for example,
or Cain and Abel,

380
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,870
which is the story of Cain and Abel in
Genesis,

381
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:21,670
by the way,
is really the second story that that's

382
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,460
in that origin myth,
and it's the first story about real

383
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,440
human beings,
right?

384
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,090
Because Adam and eve,
so to speak,

385
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,570
we're created by God.
Whereas Cain and Abel were born,

386
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,550
the first brothers.
Well,

387
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,810
what happened?
Well,

388
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:38,660
one of them became insanely jealous of
the other and murdered him,

389
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,600
so that's a pretty harsh story when you
think that you know,

390
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,903
the,
the,

391
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,800
the,
the monotheistic religions of,

392
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,770
of the West,
roughly speaking,

393
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,070
put as one of their foundational
stories.

394
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:57,071
The idea that there is a twin pair of
forces operating the human psyche that

395
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:02,240
can be conceptualized as brothers who
are murderously opposed to one another.

396
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,990
It's like
that's part of the reason why that story

397
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:09,030
hasn't disappeared.
It's so powerful.

398
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,960
It's so shocking.
It's so powerful that it can't

399
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,630
disappear,
and the reason for that is that it's

400
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,180
true in a sense.
It's true.

401
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:23,181
Like it's true that a reasonable drama,
not all of them obviously,

402
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:28,050
but a large proportion of them has a bad
guy and a good guy.

403
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,490
And then you might say,
well,

404
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,990
what would the archetypes be?
Well,

405
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,980
the archetypes would be the ultimate
good guy and the ultimate bad guy,

406
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,620
and there's representations of the

407
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,230
ultimate good guy in the ultimate bad
guy.

408
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:46,990
Young was very influenced by
Christianity and part of the reason for

409
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:49,480
that is that he grew up in a state that
was Protestant,

410
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,160
primarily Christian and a number of his
immediate ancestors were pastors,

411
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,600
so he grew up in an atmosphere that was
pretty saturated by religious ideas and

412
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,390
so a lot of his thinking was heavily
influenced by Christianity.

413
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,930
So one of the things he pointed out was
that just like Cain and Abel who are

414
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:09,520
archetypes in a sense,
they're archetypes of the.

415
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,420
They're the Old Testament version of
archetypes of the hostile brothers,

416
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,870
Christ and Satan.
Our archetypes and the reason they're

417
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:20,470
archetypes is because virtually by
definition,

418
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,010
the satanic symbol,
so to speak,

419
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,180
is a representation of symbolic
representation of everything that's

420
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,330
terrible about human beings.
It's an archetype.

421
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,330
You can't imagine anything worse than
that,

422
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,190
so it's like a limit case.

423
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,040
And then when you go to a movie and you
see bad guys,

424
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,340
you can think of them as partial
approximations of the archetype.

425
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,540
Or you can think about them as the
archetype.

426
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:49,740
Differentiated in a manner that makes
exposure to the archetype fresh and

427
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:54,180
interesting because you just don't want
to go and see the same old bad guy over

428
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:58,950
and over and over.
You want to explore the entire complex

429
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,070
behavioral and representational system
of the archetype of the,

430
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,220
of evil in every conceivable situation.
And in the same way you want to explore

431
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:14,580
the archetype of good and the reason you
want to do that in principle,

432
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,660
depending on your motivations,
is to control the influence of the

433
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:28,410
factors that underlie the negative
archetype in your life.

434
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,600
And to manifest the factors that
underlie the positive archetype.

435
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,790
And that's why you hope for the good
guy.

436
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,270
It's also why generally speaking in a
drama,

437
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,400
you embody that good guy while you're
watching the movie.

438
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
So I can give you an example of this.
So

439
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,460
one of the things I learned to do with
my son when I took them to movies

440
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,930
because when he was a little guy,
I took him to fairly intense movies and

441
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:57,210
uh,
sometimes too intense,

442
00:27:57,211 --> 00:28:01,050
but I'm.
One of the things I taught him when he

443
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:02,760
was afraid was keep your eye on the
hero,

444
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,670
not,
don't be afraid or it's not real.

445
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:09,870
It's like
you could easily make a case that had

446
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:14,580
movie is more real than normal life.
Why would you watch it otherwise?

447
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,590
What a movie is his normal life stripped
of everything that's trivial.

448
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,700
So if you strip a representation of
everything that's trivial,

449
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,530
what makes you think that isn't more
real?

450
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,430
So is fiction more real than life?
Well,

451
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,570
is abstraction more real than reality?

452
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,800
It certainly is.
In many cases.

453
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,050
I mean there are people who believe,
for example,

454
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:43,790
that mathematical representations are
are the most real of phenomena.

455
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,120
They certainly,
if you're a very powerful mathematician,

456
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,100
they certainly become.
Or if your society is very powerful

457
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:51,590
mathematically,
it certainly gives you a tremendous

458
00:28:51,591 --> 00:28:55,100
amount of control over your environment.
So the idea that abstractions aren't

459
00:28:55,101 --> 00:29:00,101
real is that's a silly idea and the idea
that fiction isn't real,

460
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,720
it all that indicates is a confusion
about what constitutes real

461
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,930
movie as a representation of
characteristic behavioral patterns

462
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,670
extending across time.
And it can be a more or less useful,

463
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,290
accurate
distillation of those representations.

464
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:26,291
And generally what we assume is that the
greater the fictional representation

465
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,420
because we make a distinction between
great fictional representations and you

466
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,880
know,
second rate fictional representations.

467
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,070
So Shakespeare,
for example,

468
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,490
is a master at exploring the contours,
the archetype in a complex,

469
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,120
realistic and useful manner.

470
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,270
Now you'll also believe so that there
were these patterns of behavior and they

471
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:57,470
would constitute the typical behavioral
patterns of Human Beings.

472
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,180
And then we evolved a system of
representations of those patterns and

473
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,310
that would,
would enable us to understand the

474
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,340
patterns in a way that other animals
can't because we're self conscious,

475
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,080
right?
So what does it mean to be self

476
00:30:12,081 --> 00:30:14,810
conscious?
It doesn't just mean that you know that

477
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:18,950
you exist as a separate entity.
It's not just a state of conscious

478
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:23,090
awareness,
it's a knowledge condition you have at

479
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:28,091
your fingertips.
A very large representational storehouse

480
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,580
of abstract knowledge about what human
beings are like.

481
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,910
And that's developed over tens of
thousands of years,

482
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,440
right?
It's a collective activity.

483
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,620
The generation of all these stories we
tell about each other.

484
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,050
I mean,
we have ancient stories.

485
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,750
The oldest stories we have,
by the way,

486
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,960
are Mesopotamian stories far as I know,
and the oldest Mesopotamian story,

487
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:54,110
or one of the oldest Mesopotamian
stories we have is a hero story where

488
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:56,270
the,
the God Marduk

489
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,820
fights a great dragon and cuts her into
pieces and makes the world and you might

490
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:05,074
think,
well,

491
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,520
what the Mesopotamians you know,
what do you mean the world's created

492
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:13,430
over the pieces of a great dragon?
Well,

493
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,930
it's,
it's a Piagetian idea with a bit of

494
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:20,450
narrative complexity added to it.
It's like,

495
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,910
well,
how do you create the world?

496
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,000
Well,
you confront the unknown and you

497
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:30,380
transform it into the known or you
confront unexplored territory and you

498
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,440
transform it into explored territory.
And then you might say,

499
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:36,290
well,
what exactly is the unknown?

500
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:40,310
Or what exactly is unexplored territory?
And as scientists would say,

501
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,180
well,
you know,

502
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:44,270
if you walk out in the field that you've
never been in before,

503
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,500
there's soil and material elements and
that's what's really there.

504
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,720
But that isn't exactly what's really
there.

505
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,550
It depends on your timeframe.
So one of the things I could say about

506
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,510
that,
for example,

507
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:05,070
is that if you wander outside the
boundaries of your knowledge,

508
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,460
if you wandered outside the boundaries
of your territory when you were an

509
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,690
animal or when you were a more archaic
human being,

510
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,470
the probability that you are going to
run into something that was going to

511
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:22,100
tear you apart and eat you was extremely
high.

512
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,500
And so then I could say,
well,

513
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,430
the fundamental nature of the unknown is
that which tears you apart in each you

514
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,380
and you might think,
well,

515
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,440
is that what sort of reality is that?
And I would say,

516
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,390
you know,
how you hear evolutionary psychologists

517
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:41,870
talk sometimes.
The fact that we evolved on the African

518
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:46,180
Veldt and now our nervous systems are
sort of adapted for that primordial

519
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,560
environment and not really for the
modern environment.

520
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,650
And so there's a mismatch between us in
the modern world.

521
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,960
It's like I,
I think that's an absolutely

522
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:58,961
reprehensible theory,
partly because we didn't just evolve on

523
00:32:59,421 --> 00:32:59,960
the velt.

524
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,000
We've been evolving for a very long
time.

525
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,220
We spent a lot more time in trees,
for example,

526
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:08,390
than we did on the Veldt and while we
were spending time in trees,

527
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:11,270
a lot of us were eaten by snakes,
for example,

528
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:16,010
and so that's another reason why the the
unknown itself is represented as this

529
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:20,810
terrible predatory reptilian beast,
and then the human being is represented

530
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:24,770
as that which or the conscious element
of the human being which is represented

531
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:28,910
by the Mesopotamians as a god,
the highest God actually in the

532
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:31,250
hierarchy of Gods,
which was a brilliant method,

533
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,840
Mesopotamian realization because the
Mesopotamians basically concluded in

534
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,790
their drama,
their religious drama,

535
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,920
that the highest faculty of the human
being was the capacity to consciously

536
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,820
attend to the unknown and to make
something new out of it.

537
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,920
Well,
that's a Piagetian idea,

538
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,840
right?
That's exactly what piaget was talking

539
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:55,841
about when he talked about the necessity
of comprehending knowledge as a process

540
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,520
rather than as a collection of fact.

541
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,260
It's a process.
What's the process?

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,120
Confront what you don't understand.
Boldly go where no one has ever gone,

543
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,770
right?
I mean Star Trek.

544
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,800
That's where a systematizing minds get
their mythology.

545
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,660
You know?
It's rife with mythology and it's

546
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,900
initial statement is a mythological
statement and it's a statement of the

547
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:22,110
eternal explorer and that's an
archetypal idea and you know,

548
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,180
you might say,
well,

549
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,110
are you still threatened by those
terrible things that threatened your

550
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,260
ancestors on the Veldt?
And normally people would say,

551
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:32,120
well no,
because there are no lions,

552
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:35,330
but that's because they don't get the
categories right.

553
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Lion is a subcategory of unknown
horrible thing and you guys are

554
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,120
surrounded by unknown horrible things
just like people have always been

555
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:48,950
surrounded by unknown horrible things,
so because you're just as prone to

556
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,780
disease,
not quite as prone,

557
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,520
but fundamentally you're a finite being
and there's things everywhere that act

558
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,870
in a predatory manner,
in relationship to you and you will die.

559
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,150
And so the idea that the material
conditions of our environment have

560
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,830
changed in a qualitative manner since
the time we spent on the belt is an.

561
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,780
It's an error of category.
The mythological categories of our

562
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,880
categories that represent environmental
entities,

563
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:20,540
so to speak,
some of which are social that have

564
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:25,541
existed for vast stretches of time and
which exceed our capacity to detect.

565
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:31,331
With our census,
so one representation for example is the

566
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:36,821
great father or the wise old man and the
wise old man of the great father is a

567
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,540
representation of the dominance
hierarchy.

568
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,720
Now the problem with the dominance
hierarchy is you can't see it,

569
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,600
but it's there.
It's really there and then figures like

570
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:51,240
the great mother,
especially the terror because most of

571
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:55,290
the archetypal figures come in pairs a
positive element and a negative element

572
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:59,760
and that's because virtually everything
that manifests itself to you in a

573
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,540
complex environment,
if you're living being takes with one

574
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,640
hand and gives with the other,
you know,

575
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,670
so nature is benevolent and kind and
wise and the source of all new knowledge

576
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,430
and also cancer and malarial mosquitoes
and the tetsy fly and the Guinea worm

577
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:21,450
and all these things that are horrifying
and destructive beyond belief and you're

578
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,280
stuck with both and then society.

579
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,160
We talked about this before.
That's the great father.

580
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,720
On the one hand here you are
benevolently protected by your social

581
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,550
surround.
On the other hand,

582
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,400
social structures tend towards tyranny
and authoritarianism and they'll press

583
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:41,250
the individuals within them at the same
time that they sustain their

584
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,040
development,
and so that's a dichotomous archetype

585
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,780
and then there's the individual who's on
the one hand a remarkable and wonderful

586
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:53,781
creature and on the other hand,
someone who's capable of atrocities like

587
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,120
those,
the characterized the auctions of many

588
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:01,470
millions of people in the 20th century.
Those are all archetypes.

589
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,990
There are more archetypes than that,
like the archetype of the predatory rep

590
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,950
tail with something to offer,
which is essentially a dragon is the

591
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,290
most fundamental archetipal
representation.

592
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,270
You found that representation in l
chemical manuscripts mostly in the form

593
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:21,540
of the Earl burls,
which is a snake that eats its own tail

594
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,190
and it's a symbol of matter and spirit
in union because the snake is sort of

595
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,480
matter and the wings on the snake,
the dragon make it spirit.

596
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,480
So it's like the fundamental elements of
reality or matter in spirit in some kind

597
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,900
of conjoined,
um,

598
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,770
state.
And the fundamental task of the human

599
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:47,250
being is to come to terms with the
nature of that unknown thing.

600
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,780
Now,
think about it this way.

601
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:52,470
Well,
why would ancient people represent the

602
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,040
unknown as such as a Reptilian self
contained reptilian form that was both

603
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,220
spiritual and Matt and material?
Well,

604
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:07,221
here's the reason.
First the unknown is dangerous and you

605
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:12,780
could be at spray so you better have
that representation at hand and then you

606
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:13,351
might ask,
well,

607
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:16,020
is that really the unknown?
And then I would say,

608
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,000
well,
it depends absolutely on what you mean

609
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:23,001
by really from a Darwinian perspective,
that was the best way to conceptualize

610
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:25,320
the unknown.
And then you might say,

611
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:28,020
well that doesn't make it real,
and then I might say,

612
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,150
you're,
are you sure about that?

613
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,710
Is there anything more real than than
representations derived from Darwinian?

614
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,750
The darwinists would say,
no.

615
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,870
Okay,
so why does it matter in spirit?

616
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,770
Why is it weighing in and on the ground
at the same time?

617
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:45,160
Well,
this is.

618
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,670
You can also understand this from a phd
and perspective and so that is because

619
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,040
when you encounter the unknown,
you separate the material world in the

620
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,460
spiritual world and the spiritual
wilderness is the psychological world

621
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,920
and so what you're doing,
when you encounter the unknown,

622
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:04,390
as you parse some of it up into the
world and you incorporate other elements

623
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:08,110
of it into yourself and the best way to
think about that,

624
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,380
I think from a conceptual perspective so
it becomes more understandable,

625
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:16,210
is that what you encounter when you
encounter the unknown is patterned

626
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:21,211
information and you take some of that
pattern and information into yourself.

627
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,360
Even by doing something as simple as
gripping something you want to pick up

628
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,560
because you're imitating the pattern of
the thing that you want to pick up.

629
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,210
And that's how you're transforming it.
Structure into an element of your being.

630
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:35,920
And so when you're exploring the
unknown,

631
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:39,490
it's constructivist idea.
You're simultaneously constructing the

632
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:44,020
world and constructing yourself,
and thus the inference is the unknown is

633
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:48,490
made out of that which can be parsed out
into psyche and matter.

634
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,150
And it's dangerous.
So it's a perfectly reasonable

635
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:54,820
representation.
And that's why it won't go away.

636
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,170
So Young's fundamental contribution,
I would say is the is his analysis of

637
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,570
hero mythology.
And I would say that's the fundamental

638
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,830
element of his thinking.
Now,

639
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,330
the relationship between that and Nisha
is fundamentally this Nicha believed

640
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,640
that once the religious systems
collapsed,

641
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,940
we would have to consciously produce our
new set of values.

642
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:20,941
But young believed that the psyche was
the source of all value and the so that

643
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,890
it wasn't a matter of creating new
values.

644
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,900
It was a matter of discovering the
values that were already lying dormant

645
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,790
and implicit within us.

646
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,120
So,
and the next thing I would say about

647
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,190
that is,
you all know this,

648
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,170
you just don't know you know it.
And so one of the reasons to be to be

649
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:46,290
educated from a literary and historical
perspective is that you can come to

650
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:50,620
understand what you already know because
if you don't understand it,

651
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,670
then there's an element of your being
the element that knows it and acts it

652
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,650
out.
And there's another element which is

653
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:00,610
sort of you as a personality that are
completely at odds with one another,

654
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,210
and that makes you weak.
It's it makes you something that's

655
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:08,140
divided within itself.
Now you're doing everything you can as a

656
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:12,550
general rule to incorporate this
information now for a long time.

657
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:17,230
It seems as if as long as we acted it
out and represented it symbolically and

658
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:21,010
didn't argue about the assumptions,
it was more or less okay,

659
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,340
but we're past that now and in order for
us to benefit from the same protective

660
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,120
structures that our ancestors benefited
from,

661
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,510
we now have to understand what they mean
consciously.

662
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,700
And that's really what young was up to.
What he was really trying to do was to

663
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,900
resurrect deep religious representations
from the dead,

664
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:51,110
so to speak,
and to make them conscious so people

665
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:55,330
could align themselves with them again.
Now I'm going to show you something

666
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,510
that's related to that.

667
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,880
All right,
now.

668
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,970
So we're going to show you something
from Pinocchio.

669
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,730
Now,
this is an initiation ritual.

670
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,600
It's a journey to the depths,
so it's journey to the underworld.

671
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,170
It's the consequence of a collapse.
In previous personality and the

672
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,670
disintegration of that previous
personality into a chaotic state,

673
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:42,350
prime prior to rebirth now what happens
in Pinocchio,

674
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,760
which by the way was released at about
the same time that World War Two was was

675
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:51,761
brewing and which also contains one of
the best representations of of the of

676
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:58,160
the individual motivations for fascism
that I've ever seen anywhere.

677
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,890
That's the scenes that are associated
with pleasure island.

678
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,520
Remember all the.
The puppet is trying to become a real

679
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:05,121
boy,
right?

680
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:08,990
So he's a Marionette to begin with,
something else is pulling his strings

681
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,640
well for you.
That's your habitual state of being.

682
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,390
Something else is pulling your strings.
Even the idea that you're autonomous is

683
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,180
the consequence of something else
pulling your strings and for you.

684
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,250
What you needed to do was find out
exactly who and what is pulling your

685
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,490
strings and decide if that's the
direction in which you want to go,

686
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,160
and that's really what happens to
Pinocchio because we're going to watch

687
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,770
Pinocchio Part of it in the Pinocchio
Story.

688
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:39,890
He starts out as a marionette.
Now he's a Marionette,

689
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:42,740
made by a good father because Japan was
a good father.

690
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:46,340
He's a good craftsman and so on.
So he's a marionette with a benevolent

691
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:48,500
puppeteer.
But as soon as he developed some

692
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:53,180
autonomy,
then he becomes pray to forces that are

693
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,940
elements of the demonic archetype.
In fact,

694
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,250
the worst bad guy in the entire movie
turns into Satan himself at one point in

695
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:04,460
the movie,
basically has horns in a bright red face

696
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:08,480
and he manifests himself as so
terrifying that the coyote,

697
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,083
coyote,

698
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,960
[inaudible] Fox and the cap that are
trying to corrupt Pinocchio or terrified

699
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:19,440
because they get like they're criminals.
They're petty criminals and deceptive

700
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,780
and so forth.
But when they get a look at who's

701
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:23,910
pulling their strings,
it's enough to terrify them.

702
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,390
And so Pinocchio goes through a series
of temptations of various sorts,

703
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:33,930
including authority and,
and the Freudian temptation is to remain

704
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:36,840
weak and sickly instead of becoming a
real person.

705
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,280
So it's an eternal problem.
And another problem that faces Pinocchio

706
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:46,281
is that he's offered false celebrity as
a way of solving his life's problems.

707
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:49,290
So he's offered the opportunity to
become an actor.

708
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,560
And what that means is a deceitful fake
who's constructed a persona that makes

709
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,210
him appear far more valuable than he
really is.

710
00:44:57,211 --> 00:45:01,800
So the movie outlines to pathological
modes of movement towards maturity,

711
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:06,600
one being a phony and the other taking
the easy way out,

712
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:11,601
and the and hyper are valuing all your
pathology so that you become dependent.

713
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,720
So anyways,
and then another mode of pathological

714
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:23,400
development is offered to Pinocchio,
which is to do nothing but engage in

715
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,160
short term,
impulsive and destructive play.

716
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,070
And that's on treasure island.
But when he pleasure island,

717
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:33,030
but when he goes to pleasure island,
he finds that it's actually ruled by

718
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,330
demonic forces with faceless entities
who are transforming all the pleasure

719
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:45,471
seeking marionettes to braying donkeys
who are slaves like.

720
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,340
So Pinocchio escapes from that end.
He does it basically by jumping into the

721
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:57,400
unknown.
And that's where we're going to start

722
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,330
our exposure to his initiation.

723
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,840
Okay,
so now you can imagine what's happened

724
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:38,440
is he was on pleasure island and
everything went to hell fundamentally.

725
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,040
And so he jumped into the water to
escape from that.

726
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,320
That's equivalent to plunging into
chaos.

727
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:49,321
And Chaos was an escape from
pathological tyranny and now he's trying

728
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:53,980
to go home.
So this is the psyche in it's searched

729
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,830
for maturation,
runs into an obstacle which is the

730
00:46:56,831 --> 00:47:00,930
tyrannical element of the great father
that it cannot cope with and it trucks

731
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,330
home runs,
hope to defeat typical part of a hero's

732
00:47:04,331 --> 00:47:06,880
story is the initial defeat of the hero
when he

733
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,490
encounters usually either the terrible
great father or the terrible great

734
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:14,620
mother,
so and so.

735
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:19,621
This is a retrogressive you'll would
call this retrogressive restoration of

736
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:23,410
the persona,
so it's sort of like maybe you're a well

737
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:26,410
adapted adolescent and you live at home
and you're happy adolescent and

738
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,600
everything's good at home,
and then you go out to try to be an

739
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:31,210
adult and you fail,
and then when you come back home you try

740
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:35,260
to act like a happy adolescent again,
but you're not what you are in fact is

741
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,280
an unhappy adult.

742
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,150
And if you move back to the happy
adolescent mode of being,

743
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,400
then it's false and pathological.
You can't go home again.

744
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,510
Another typical motif in literature.
Now the cricket.

745
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,480
I can't tell you everything about this
story.

746
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,120
I can tell you a couple of strange
things about it.

747
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,160
One is that the cricket is Jimminy
Cricket,

748
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:58,840
right?
And the initials of Jimminy cricket or

749
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:03,790
RJC and Jimminy cricket was a common
Southern American

750
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:10,470
mild form of a cursing.
It's the equivalent of Jesus Christ.

751
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,790
And so you might think,
and of course the cricket is Pinocchio's

752
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,820
conscience and well,
so then you might ask yourself why in

753
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:23,821
the world would a pejorative,
mildly pejorative term for Jesus Christ

754
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:30,331
be applied to a cricket who's guiding a
puppet into the water to rescue his

755
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,610
father from a whale?
Why would any of that happen?

756
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,250
And answer to that is,
you know why,

757
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:40,210
but you can't say why you can't say why,
you know,

758
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,290
or what it is that you know,
but the mere fact that it makes sense

759
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,520
and it does is an indication from union
perspective that you're operating in an

760
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:49,390
archetipal level.

761
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,390
You understand this.
And so I could say,

762
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,730
here's an example of why the cricket is
a bug.

763
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,530
Well,
things bug you,

764
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,260
right?
We say that things bug me.

765
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,020
Well,
you should do something about the things

766
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:06,400
that bug you because that's your
conscience calling to you.

767
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,680
It's it's destiny in some sense,
manifesting itself as an unconscious

768
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:16,030
impulse that really bugs me means if you
can,

769
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,100
you should do something about it because
you think about it,

770
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,840
man.
There's a lot of things out there that

771
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,300
might bug you,
but lots of them don't.

772
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,210
But as some of them do,
well,

773
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,100
why do those bug you and not other
things?

774
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,610
Well,
that's a complicated question,

775
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:34,870
but one potential answer to it is that
there's part of your psyche that's

776
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,680
oriented towards further development.
Young would call that the self and

777
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:42,840
that's like the totality of everything
that you could be and it's,

778
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,743
it's,
it's,

779
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,180
it's a,
it's a strange sort of entity in some

780
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:50,170
sense because it's partly potential and
it's potential that expands across time.

781
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,560
But the way that your potential totality
calls to you in the present is by

782
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,150
placing things in front of you that are
your problem and they announced

783
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:04,780
themselves as your problem and they do
that by bothering you.

784
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:11,910
So then if you pick up the task of
fixing the things that bothers you,

785
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,740
then you find the pathway to further
expansion of your personality.

786
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,710
So,
and that's what's happening with

787
00:50:19,711 --> 00:50:21,180
Pinocchio now.
One of the things that's really

788
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:24,090
interesting about the Pinocchio movie
and that makes it incredibly

789
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,310
sophisticated,
is that despite the fact that the

790
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:29,810
cricket is a Avatar of Christ,
so to speak,

791
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,780
the cricket has things to learn just
like Pinocchio.

792
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,870
And so that's very cool because it's so
cool.

793
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:38,750
It's so sophisticated because it means
that you do have a conscience that

794
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:42,230
guides you,
but until you establish a dialogue with

795
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:45,650
it,
both you and the conscience or immature,

796
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,510
you have to establish a conscious dialog
with it and then interact together in a

797
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:52,670
manner that propels your development
across time.

798
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,750
And that'll stop you from being a
Marionette of forces that would make you

799
00:50:56,751 --> 00:51:00,230
a brain donkey who does nothing but
slave away in salt mines.

800
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,020
So,
okay,

801
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,420
so Pinocchio goes home and that doesn't
work,

802
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:07,160
and that's where we're gonna.
Start here.

803
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,960
Okay.
So what's happened there?

804
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,790
Well,
many,

805
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:09,810
many things at multiple levels of
reality simultaneously.

806
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,750
And that's the characteristic of an
archetypal story.

807
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,770
So on one level,
Pinocchio's too old to go home,

808
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,300
he can't go home to his father because
in some sense he's already transcended

809
00:52:21,301 --> 00:52:23,340
his father.
So there are things,

810
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,290
for example,
that your father can't help you with.

811
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,880
And the reason for that is that you
don't.

812
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,670
He doesn't know any more about the
situation than you do and he can't.

813
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,010
And so that's where his knowledge limits
out.

814
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,530
So that would be sort of on the personal
level.

815
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,550
And then on the trends personal level,
which would be the deeper,

816
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,950
deeper archetipal level.
What's happening to Pinocchio is exactly

817
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:43,140
what needs you described at the end of
the 19th century,

818
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:47,130
because remember that Japan has his
creator and now he's dead.

819
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
He's gone.
And so Pinocchio is bereft of,

820
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,323
of

821
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,720
placement,
so to speak.

822
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,610
He's,
his soul has been corrupted and he

823
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:02,720
doesn't know what to do about it.
And when he returns to his family home

824
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,710
or when he returns to his tradition,
what he finds is nothing.

825
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,530
Okay?
So then what happens?

826
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,150
Well,
this is another thing that you'll

827
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:16,040
swallow with just no problem whatsoever.
While this dove comes along that's sort

828
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,310
of Goldman glowing and drops a note
right in front of him.

829
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,160
Now you may remember,
and perhaps you don't,

830
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:27,161
but the star from which the dove comes
is a representation of the blue fairy

831
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,630
and the blue fairy is the positive
element of the unknown in Pinocchio

832
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,060
Movie.
And so what it basically is saying that

833
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,830
when you're despairing because your
father has died and your tradition has

834
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:44,400
nothing to offer,
that the positive element of the unknown

835
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:47,160
may provide you with a message about
where to go.

836
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,160
If you pay enough attention.
That would be an intuition or it would

837
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:56,310
be the automatic attraction of your
interest to a new thing by forces that

838
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:59,880
you do not understand.
So one of the real ways of coming to

839
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:04,881
grips with the idea of the act of the
unconscious is to understand that you

840
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,960
cannot control what you're interested
in.

841
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,780
And so then you might ask,
well,

842
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:13,050
if it's not you,
what is it?

843
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,560
And if you think about that problem long
enough,

844
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:21,270
you'll start to understand what you was
talking about because that is the way

845
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:26,160
that you can understand in your own life
that the things that direct you as a

846
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:29,580
being are not things that you
consciously choose.

847
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,680
In fact,
they're not even things that you can

848
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,370
consciously choose.
They're directed by other forces.

849
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,680
So anyways,
the dove drops a message in front of

850
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:42,930
Pinocchio and,
and the cricket.

851
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:51,750
Now it's the cricket that reads it.
So it's the same idea as what bugs you,

852
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,540
so to speak.
The cricket is an interpreter.

853
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,270
Okay,
so now what have we found out?

854
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,820
Well,
we found out that God,

855
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,680
the father and God the father,
the Creator are not in fact dad,

856
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,150
which is what needs should pronounced
but alive in some weird way,

857
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:39,220
and this horrible creature at the bottom
of the ocean.

858
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,130
And so what is Pinocchio decided to do?
He decides to go find them.

859
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,970
That's actually what you're doing at
university by the way,

860
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,100
for all the chaos that you experience
when you come to university and all the

861
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:58,900
uncertainty and all the doubt.
What you're trying to do is to resurrect

862
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:01,360
your dad,
father from the bottom of the ocean,

863
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,980
and if you do that,
you won't be a Marionette and if you

864
00:56:05,981 --> 00:56:07,420
don't,
you will be.

865
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,490
Now,
this is very interesting because the

866
00:56:26,491 --> 00:56:30,180
conscience here plays a very dichotomous
role,

867
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,570
so on the one hand,
Pinocchio is often ahead of his

868
00:56:33,571 --> 00:56:34,980
conscience,
so to speak.

869
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:39,090
So he's taking the leading role and the
dialogue is kind of choppy and neither

870
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:42,990
of them know exactly what they're doing.
But in this situation it's very

871
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:47,430
paradoxical because you can see
Pinocchio's been half turned into bring

872
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:50,310
Jack Ass at this point.
Something you might well consider when

873
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:52,680
you remember your adolescence.
So

874
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,740
at this point that that the cricket,
his conscience does two things.

875
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:02,730
It warns them how horrible this is going
to be and how utterly dangerous it is.

876
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,390
And then at the same time it helps them
prepare and goes along with them.

877
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:09,030
And so it's quite comical.
So watch what happens here.

878
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,980
Okay,
so I've cut this a little bit,

879
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:37,460
but what happens in the movie is that he
goes to the bottom of the ocean and he

880
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:41,450
starts to ask about monster.
And as soon as he asked any of the fish

881
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:45,860
down there,
the denizens of the sub oceanic world

882
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,980
where monster ways they just run away.
And so monster,

883
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:51,980
who is he who cannot be named,
right?

884
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,710
And I'm sure you've encountered that in
your reading before,

885
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,090
right?
That's the,

886
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,250
that's the hallmark of

887
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,040
in the Harry Potter series,
right?

888
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,140
See now you've done it.
Yeah.

889
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,360
So this represents something so terrible
that it can't even be talked about.

890
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,150
Okay.
So what happens is Pinocchio ends up not

891
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:17,900
only at the bottom of the ocean,
but he has to go to the deepest part of

892
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:21,860
the bottom of the ocean where the most
terrible thing rests.

893
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,030
And so we're cutting to the point where
he does that.

894
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,970
So now you might ask how did Japan will
get into the whale?

895
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,520
And answer to that is,
it's never really made that clear in the

896
00:59:04,521 --> 00:59:07,700
movie,
but I can tell you some things about

897
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:08,534
that.
Is that

898
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,163
okay

899
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:16,000
if you conceptualize your historical
tradition as a personality,

900
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,700
like a body of laws and customs?
Say

901
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,750
it's not.
It's dead,

902
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,710
right?
Because it's composed of the past and

903
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,630
because it's dead,
it can't come up with anything new,

904
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:35,290
so if it encounters something new,
it it stopped and that's what's happened

905
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,900
to Japan is that he's engulfed by this
entity that represents the absolute

906
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,360
unknown and he cannot figure out how to
get out,

907
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,030
and the reason for that is none of the
things he knows,

908
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,750
so none of the things that history has
produced as a body of knowledge are

909
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:53,870
sufficient to deal with the fundamental
problem.

910
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:59,590
That doesn't mean they're useless.
It just means that just like the puppet

911
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:04,640
is lost without the farther,
the farther is also lost without the

912
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:08,240
puppet,
and that's the relationship between you

913
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:09,770
and history,
your history.

914
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,800
When you study history,
you think while you're studying a record

915
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:14,840
of events in the past and that's not
right.

916
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,240
What you're studying is the
circumstances that gave rise to you as

917
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,590
a,
as a being,

918
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,720
and unless you understand your history
in every way you possibly can,

919
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,580
then you're an incomplete creature.
You don't know enough to move forward

920
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:38,530
in the same way your culture being
composed of dead father's,

921
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,500
so to speak,
can't progress without you because

922
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:47,501
you're its eyes and there's an Egyptian
story that features the God Horus,

923
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:51,740
who I've talked to you about before,
who actually resurrect his father from

924
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:55,830
the dad by giving him an I
so Japan,

925
01:00:55,831 --> 01:00:58,340
I can't figure out how to get out of
this whale without help.

926
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,570
So he's kind of pushing up tombstones
there.

927
01:01:18,571 --> 01:01:19,404
You might note,

928
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,050
all right,
now something very sophisticated happens

929
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:29,520
here so and I have to explain it to you
at multiple levels at the same time.

930
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:34,521
So now Japan is hungry and when the
whale opens its mouth,

931
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,750
a lot of fish come in.
Now,

932
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:41,390
one of the things I want you to think
about,

933
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,080
you can just put this in the back of
your mind,

934
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:47,400
is that one of the oldest sister,
one of the oldest symbolic

935
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:52,320
representations of Christ is a fish and
all of his followers were fishermen,

936
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:56,910
and so there's this weird relationship
between the messianic figure who's at

937
01:01:56,911 --> 01:01:59,010
the base of it,
at least at the base of Christian

938
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:02,430
culture and the idea of things that are
pulled up from the depths.

939
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,770
Now,
here's what happens in this part of the

940
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:06,300
movie.
It's so amazing.

941
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:10,830
So Japan was looking for fish and the
reason for that is he doesn't think he

942
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:13,050
can get out of the whale,
and so he might as well have some fish

943
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:16,470
while he's while he's in there,
and so he's given up on getting out.

944
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:20,610
Now what happens is that the whale
swallows as if he's a fish,

945
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:26,170
so Pinocchio was put into the same
category as fish and it happens.

946
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,580
It happens to Japan a couple of times.
He Mistakes Pinocchio for a fish.

947
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,430
You'll see.
So what that means in some senses that

948
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:36,190
you pedo can't distinguish between the
fish.

949
01:02:36,191 --> 01:02:39,400
That will feed you for the day and
whatever it is that Pinocchio

950
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,740
represents,
and so you could think about Pinocchio

951
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:46,180
as a fisherman instead of as a fish,
and so you can think about it this way.

952
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,140
And here,
here's a.

953
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,120
here's a,
an old saying,

954
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,940
if you give a man a fish,
you feed him for one day,

955
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:54,610
but if you teach him to fish,
you feed him forever.

956
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,660
And so the idea is it's better to
develop the skill to acquire something

957
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:00,970
than it is to have the thing.
Now,

958
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:05,710
what Pinocchio represents is
he's like a mega fish.

959
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,870
I know this is a strange way of thinking
about it.

960
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,140
Japan was problem,
isn't that he's hungry.

961
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,880
His problem is that he can't get out of
the whale and so what he's fishing for

962
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:20,020
isn't something to eat.
It's something that will help them get

963
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:23,290
out of the whale,
but he can't recognize the difference

964
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:27,850
between the approximate solution,
which is so that he'll no longer be

965
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:29,590
hungry.
So he's got a very short term outlook

966
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,710
and a solution to the much broader
problems.

967
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:35,420
So what happens is the whale swallows a
bunch of fish in Pinocchio's in there

968
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:40,421
and Japan was fishing away and he
catches Pinocchio and Pinocchio

969
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:44,170
Announces Himself and Japan says,
tells them to be quiet because he's

970
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:46,990
interfering with him fishing.
And then when he turns to Hug Pinocchio

971
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,780
because he wakes up,
he actually hugs a fish and then he

972
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:53,050
discards the fish.
So then he figures out the Pinocchios

973
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:54,400
there.
Then Japan,

974
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:55,110
oh,
decides that.

975
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,410
Well,
they're going to have to live inside the

976
01:03:56,411 --> 01:04:00,370
whale and it's another I idea of his
blindness at this point because he's.

977
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,800
He's composed of the dead past so to
speak.

978
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,270
So what Pinocchio does it start to
destroy the ship itself,

979
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,560
which is what they're floating in and
the whale to start a fire and the fire

980
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:13,450
makes the whale mad enough to spit them
out.

981
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:16,570
And the whale then transforms itself
into a dragon and tries to kill them

982
01:04:16,571 --> 01:04:18,970
because it's a fire breathing entity at
that point.

983
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:24,100
And so part of the understory is it's
better to figure out how to fish than to

984
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:28,090
fish or that more profoundly,
it's better to figure out how to do

985
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:30,910
something than to merely benefit from
the thing itself.

986
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:34,540
Pinocchio represents that which can do
new things.

987
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:39,040
So he's a hero and he's willing to
destroy part of the current order that's

988
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:44,041
the ship in order to produce a new
strategy that will actually free them

989
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:47,070
from the way out.
Now he wants to get his farther out of

990
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:49,770
there too.
So that's what happens in the next five

991
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:50,610
minutes,
I would say.

992
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,820
Come down here.

993
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,200
Okay.
So now there's a shark here because

994
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,440
essentially in some sense the entity
that's going to provide the solution to

995
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,360
this very complex problem has arrived on
the scene,

996
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,150
but it's quite damaged.
First of all,

997
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:57,940
it's been speaking improperly,
right?

998
01:08:57,941 --> 01:09:02,941
So that's an adolescent representation.
So it braise a lot of nonsense and it's

999
01:09:03,221 --> 01:09:06,100
been corrupted in a variety of ways.
And so you know,

1000
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,070
to to some degree,
what that means is that as you mature

1001
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,910
and you're moving away from your mere
marionette status,

1002
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,730
your interaction with society like Russo
said,

1003
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:18,520
corrupts you in all sorts of ways.
I mean you're participating in that

1004
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:19,870
corruption,
but it still happens.

1005
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,680
But in the representation in the movie,
the truth of the matter is,

1006
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:27,460
is doesn't matter if you've been
corrupted to some degree,

1007
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,540
as long as you have an absolutely
sacrificed to your capacity for true

1008
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:34,570
speech and vision.
So you know that's a pretty hopeful

1009
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:38,620
message because Pinocchio is by no means
a perfect entity,

1010
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,240
but he might be good enough.

1011
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,320
See,
that's also an indication there of white

1012
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:16,321
people are often unwilling to form of
representation with a so to speak form a

1013
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:22,330
relationship with the archetype of the
great father because to some degree the

1014
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:26,380
archetype is a figure of perfection.
And the individual in relationship to

1015
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:28,900
that archetype is always pathologically
flawed.

1016
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:31,570
And so the embarrassment of that
realization,

1017
01:10:31,571 --> 01:10:33,760
which is exactly what's happening to
Pinocchio Right now,

1018
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:36,220
is often enough to stop people from
doing it.

1019
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,070
So what,
what that would say to say what that

1020
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:44,071
means in some sense is that in order for
you to mature in the fullest possible

1021
01:10:44,171 --> 01:10:48,400
manner,
you have to understand the manner in

1022
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:50,860
which you're deeply flawed in
relationship to the,

1023
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:54,040
to your,
your potential as it might be

1024
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,220
historically determined.
And that's a very bitter thing to do.

1025
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,900
You know,
it's much easier and people do this all

1026
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:02,740
the time to engage in half witted
formulaic,

1027
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,250
ideological criticisms of the system as
a whole.

1028
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:07,720
It's like,
you know,

1029
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,250
the probability that the system is more
flawed than you is pretty damn low.

1030
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,410
So you want to start with,
you know,

1031
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:17,790
getting rid of your donkey ears in your
tail and stopped bringing nonsense

1032
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:20,790
before you judge the entire,
you know,

1033
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,830
historical process by which human beings
have come into being.

1034
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,010
So anyways,
that's kind of what that means.

1035
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:53,180
What do you
eat

1036
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:11,190
when you eat
it?

1037
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,700
Whole Pinocchio.

1038
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,050
Okay.
So this is very interesting too because.

1039
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,410
So Pinocchio ends up being a master of
fire.

1040
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,800
While you can think about that as there
was a book written awhile back by a

1041
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,370
primatologist who also wrote demonic
males,

1042
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:39,140
Richard rang him and he talked about the
origin of fire and as far as Wrangham is

1043
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:41,330
concerned,
we invented fire about 2 million years

1044
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:46,331
ago and that enabled us to cook food and
that enabled us to swap intestinal

1045
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:50,960
length for brain.
So if you look at a chimpanzee,

1046
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,410
chimpanzees are like the ultimate in
couch potatoes,

1047
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,311
right?
They're,

1048
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:56,720
they're,
they're about this high and they're

1049
01:12:56,721 --> 01:13:00,080
shaped like this.
They have this huge barrel body and the

1050
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:03,500
reason they have that is because they
eat leaves and so they have to spend

1051
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:06,680
like eight hours a day eating leaves.
They will eat meat if they can get it.

1052
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,680
They have to spend like eight hours a
day eating leaves and just chewing them

1053
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,660
over and over because like leaves a.

1054
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,560
They don't want to be eating,
so they're pretty tough than inedible

1055
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,840
and B,
they don't have any new tricks.

1056
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,390
Nutritive quality,
just speak up.

1057
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,300
So the chimpanzee has to spend all of
its time chewing,

1058
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,240
which is rather mindless endeavor.
All things considered.

1059
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,840
Whereas human beings 2 million years ago
or thereabouts,

1060
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,330
invented fire and as a consequence of
that,

1061
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,450
we could cook meat and meat is
incredibly energy rich and so and it's

1062
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:40,010
easy to digest once it's cooked and so
the consequence of the invention of fire

1063
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:45,011
was that were the way we are today.
We could have a brain instead of a gut.

1064
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:50,630
And so the idea that Pinocchio's mastery
of fire,

1065
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:54,170
and it's as something more than merely a
means of cooking.

1066
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:55,340
That's how it started out.
Right?

1067
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:59,960
But you can think of our entire
technological capacity as stemming from

1068
01:13:59,961 --> 01:14:02,840
the mastery of fire.
Now the other thing you can think of,

1069
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:07,520
and this is very much worth considering,
is that Pinocchio Masters Fire and that

1070
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:09,110
turns the whale into a dragon.

1071
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,100
And so the idea there too is that,
and this is an old idea,

1072
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:17,101
is that our technological prowess is
something that makes nature itself

1073
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,450
angry.
And of course you might say,

1074
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:23,470
well,
do you believe this?

1075
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:24,940
And the answer to that is,
well,

1076
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:27,100
how many of you have environmentalist
leanings?

1077
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:30,720
And that's exactly the story that you're
following you,

1078
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,630
because you're still wondering about
whether not mastery of fire was in

1079
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:38,380
somehow against the natural order and
then it will end up in all of our depths

1080
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,600
and you know that's a reasonable thing
to worry about,

1081
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:45,010
but not mastering it was going to end up
pretty badly too.

1082
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,023
So

1083
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,200
sense.

1084
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:33,550
So here,
what happens is that in the midst of

1085
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:36,630
this complete chaos,
Pinocchio has a choice and the choices

1086
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,010
you can either save themselves,
which is a very,

1087
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:44,011
very selfish choice and reduces him to
an Aa historical individual because he

1088
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:49,921
has no relationship left with his father
or he can put himself at great risk and

1089
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,290
rescue his father.
No,

1090
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:54,970
finish the process.
Stop his father from drowning and

1091
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,600
complete the story.
Okay,

1092
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:31,881
so
Pinocchio Dies and then his father

1093
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:36,981
brings him home.
And so because he's rescued is farther,

1094
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:57,700
the benevolent spirit of nature appears.
Resurrect him and turns them into a real

1095
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:05,540
human being.
So it's pretty funny as far as I'm

1096
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:20,160
concerned that the answer to Nietzsche's
Greek question manifested itself in

1097
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:23,830
Nineteen,
mid 19 thirties in the forms of a Gnat

1098
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,390
form of an animated child's movie.
So you know,

1099
01:19:27,391 --> 01:19:28,900
and that's an,
that's an example.

1100
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:32,430
That's an example of a number of things,
an example of how archetypes work.

1101
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:37,290
It's also an example of how artists are
on the edge of discovery all the time

1102
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,570
and they discover things they don't even
understand.

1103
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,480
So we'll see you next Tuesday.
