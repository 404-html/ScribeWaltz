1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
Yeah,

2
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,010
one of the fundamental thesis of this 
course is that

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,530
in modern literature and the literature 
that isn't so modern,

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,660
there's the notion of a human created 
monster Frankenstein,

5
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,150
right springs to mind and at an adequate
time.

6
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,390
I mean Frankenstein was a fantasy and 
unconscious fantasy,

7
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,224
a dream in actuality about the potential
dangers of unbridled technological 

8
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,660
advancement.
Right?

9
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,110
Well,
this Frankenstein a monster's face,

10
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:03,944
so daily.
I mean it's become a constant part of 

11
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,000
our existence.
Why is that?

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,193
Well,
maybe it's something like this and this 

13
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,700
is certainly a notion that young would 
agree with,

14
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,103
okay,

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,153
if we don't develop a moral sense as 
conscious and is elaborated as our 

16
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,064
technological sense,
the fact that we're capable of becoming 

17
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,200
increasingly powerful will necessarily 
do us in

18
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,783
the bigger your weapons,
the smarter you better be to control 

19
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,320
them and so maybe it is something like 
this maybe,

20
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,443
and this is a strict union notion.
Maybe 500 years ago when we started to 

21
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,363
ratchet up the rate at which we were 
developing our technological expertise 

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,803
and left our mythological and religious 
presuppositions and conceptions behind 

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,260
as archaic and perhaps as predicated on 
superstition.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,640
Maybe we need to spend as much time 
updating them and bringing them into the

25
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,474
domain of clear consciousness and 
control as we have spent on developing 

26
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,490
our technological sense.

27
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,140
If you were a medieval Christian or an 
archaic religious thinker of any sort,

28
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,003
you're first presupposition was that the
world and the cosmos existed exactly as 

29
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:25,084
they appeared,
which with you or at least your village 

30
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,504
or town or country out the center and 
certainly with the Earth at the center 

31
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,184
and with the cosmos as a shield around 
the earth and with the earth itself as 

32
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,480
the domain of man being the fundamental 
attribute of the cosmos.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,673
So this is a quotation from young and 
it's when I like a lot because I think 

34
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:47,794
it adequately and succinctly describes 
the distinction between the way that 

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,580
modern people think and the way that 
people think.

36
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,730
If they're still ensconced within 
traditional belief form.

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,690
How totally did the different.
Did the world appear to medieval man?

38
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,003
For him,
the Earth was eternally fixed and it 

39
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:08,394
rest in the center of the universe and 
circled by the course of a son that's 

40
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,480
solicitously bestowed.

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,480
It's warm despite the fact that pre 
empirical people have to deal with death

42
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,060
and disease on a scale that I think is 
completely unknown to us.

43
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,343
It doesn't seem unreasonable to 
presuppose that there was a certain 

44
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,000
degree of comfort to be found in the 
worldview of this sort,

45
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,834
right,
because it appeared at least to the 

46
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,324
casual observer that the cosmos was 
human centric and that the notion that 

47
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,464
human purpose was in some way associated
with cosmic significance seem to be 

48
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,464
beyond question,
at least in part because there were no 

49
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,410
theories of reality that would compete 
with that initial preconception.

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,813
Man.
We're all children of God under the 

51
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,614
loving care of the most high who 
prepared them for eternal blessedness 

52
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,963
and all knew exactly what they should do
and how they should conduct themselves 

53
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,180
in order to rise from a corruptible 
world to an incorruptible.

54
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:09,070
Enjoy US existence.
Such a life no longer seems real to us.

55
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
Even in our dreams.
Natural sciences long ago torn this 

56
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,524
lovely veil to shreds.
How is it that people could think that 

57
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,604
way,
given that it was so wrong and still 

58
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,780
survive?
Given that in large part,

59
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,660
we are necessary necessarily creatures 
of tradition.

60
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,823
How is it that we can sever the ties 
with the manner in which our ancestors 

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,993
thought

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,761
and suffer?
No,

63
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:39,761
we'll consequences in result people 
think automatically and I think for good

64
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:40,874
reasons that the march of human thought 
has been unbroken progress towards 

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,710
increased rationality,
increased power,

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,663
increased clarity,
but it's certainly the case that as a 

67
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,334
consequence of sacrifice of our 
religious beliefs and are full of 

68
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
philosophical beliefs that problems of 
meaning have become more paramount for 

69
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,620
the modern person and then you might 
ask,

70
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,454
well,
what exactly are the consequences of 

71
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,194
that?
And I think initially the best 

72
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:08,180
perspective to take is one that's 
historical.

73
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,030
As we've moved away from a classical,
mystical or mythological worldview,

74
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,900
a number of dramatic occurrences of 
unfolded,

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,110
we've become much more technologically 
powerful,

76
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,243
right?
The application of a strict empirical 

77
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,674
model designed to abstract out from 
everyone's experiment experience those 

78
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,910
things that are material and constant 
have enabled us to produce

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,650
technological implements of extreme 
power,

80
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:39,820
right?
Both for good,

81
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,863
at least in principle with regards to 
medical advances and also for eal in 

82
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,940
terms of our ability to control weapons 
of unbelievable destructive force,

83
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,670
so we're more powerful hardware.
Any smarter or any wiser?

84
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,213
Well,
I think a casual glance at the history 

85
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,960
of the 20th century was suggest that 
perhaps we're not.

86
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,240
I don't think there's any indication 
whatsoever,

87
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
although perhaps things have improved in
the last 15 years that an additional 

88
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,054
consequence of our capacity to extract 
ourselves from our religious modes of 

89
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,334
thought has been a palpable increase in 
wisdom or tolerance or compassion or a 

90
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,614
palpable increase in our ability to 
understand explicitly what might 

91
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,830
constitute the basis for a suitable and 
stable state.

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,693
So you might take,
for example the fact that the 20th 

93
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,380
century has been unbelievably bloody 
right.

94
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,423
Literally hundreds of millions of people
killed in conflicts of one form or 

95
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,520
another.
Both external say in the course of world

96
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:45,521
war two or Vietnam and internal in the 
case of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union

97
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,900
or any of the vast array of countries 
who've subjected they're citizens too.

98
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,250
Terrible internal repression in the name
of the maintenance of order.

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,413
They Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn estimated 
that 60 million people died in the 

100
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,063
Soviet Union between 19,
19 in 1959 as a consequence of internal 

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,053
repression,
and his estimates were that perhaps 

102
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,280
twice that many died during the cultural
revolution in China.

103
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,930
Looking back on the 20th century,
one seat,

104
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
one thing seems relatively clear,
right?

105
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,043
Although
humanity as a whole has ceased or had 

106
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:30,860
ceased at least to engage in large scale
religious conflicts.

107
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:35,600
Although they seem to have been making a
vicious comeback in the last five years.

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,433
Our ability to live together still seems
incredibly compromised by our capacity 

109
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,640
to engage in ideological conflict.
Right?

110
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:49,120
And it doesn't seem to me ridiculous to 
presume

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,030
that the battles between capitalism and 
communism say,

112
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:54,864
or between capitalism and Communism and 
fascism or even the emergent struggle 

113
00:07:58,921 --> 00:07:59,754
between fundamentalist Islam and the 
West can necessarily be regarded as 

114
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,724
anything but extensions of our tendency 
towards religious and mythological 

115
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,174
conflict.
Even though in principle systems like 

116
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:12,174
Communism and fascism were not 
predicated on explicitly religious 

117
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:20,181
presuppositions.
Well,

118
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:22,614
it seems to me that the logical 
conclusion from observations of that 

119
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,174
sword is that even if you eradicate the 
traditional trappings of a mythological 

120
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,033
worldview,
which seems to be what's happened as a 

121
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:36,210
consequence of our rise in empirical 
knowledge,

122
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,170
that you don't eradicate the tendency 
for people to formulate groups,

123
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,000
belief systems

124
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,560
around conceptions of ways that you 
should behave that are at the very least

125
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,340
religious instructor and action,
even if they're not religious and name.

126
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,213
I mean,
I think it's a very peculiar 

127
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,850
coincidence.
For example,

128
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:01,851
that the Soviet communists erected a 
male Trinity Marx,

129
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,493
Lenin and Stalin as an apparent 
replacement for the masculine trinity 

130
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,850
that comprised the essential duties of 
Orthodox Russian Orthodox Christianity.

131
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,920
Why would these forms reemerged so 
spontaneously and what does it mean that

132
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:20,754
people who regard themselves as 
essentially modern and empirical in 

133
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:24,924
their presuppositions seem to be 
absolutely susceptible in their 

134
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:34,401
fundament to ideological claims?
I'll let you look at the Soviet Union,

135
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,710
which I think is very instructive case 
because the Soviets,

136
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,633
the Russians who really the last 
European power to fall prey to the 

137
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,410
conflict between empiricism and science 
and religion,

138
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,550
and they didn't really fall prey to that
until the mid 18 hundreds because Russia

139
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,820
was a relatively close society,
relatively illiterate,

140
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,873
uh,
maintaining a medieval structure far 

141
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,314
past the time when other European 
countries had abandoned that in the 18 

142
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:03,924
fifties,
a wave of atheism spread across Russia 

143
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,750
in some sense as a wave of 
enlightenment,

144
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:14,751
but also as a plague and figures as
towering as tolstoy

145
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,770
remembered in his memoirs.

146
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,923
The very day that he realized that the 
empirical discoveries of western 

147
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,060
Europeans had eradicated his ability to 
believe in the Russian Orthodox system.

148
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,690
You lose something like that.
What happens?

149
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,793
Well,
if you believe that mythological 

150
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,884
thinking is nothing but superstitious 
empiricism and that it's been replaced 

151
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,920
entirely by a more appropriate modern 
view,

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,150
then nothing happens,
right?

153
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,060
It's all to your benefit to become 
enlightened.

154
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,133
But if you believe that there's more to 
the story than that and that more 

155
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,763
traditional ethical and moral systems 
predicated on mythological 

156
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,814
presuppositions are for you a map of how
to behave and what to think and how to 

157
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,790
regulate your emotions and what to 
strive for,

158
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,300
none of which can be replaced by a 
scientific perspective.

159
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,360
And the eradication of a system like 
that leaves a vacuum.

160
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,690
And then the question is,
what rushes in to fill a vacuum?

161
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,883
Well,
if you look at the case of the Soviet 

162
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,090
Union seems quite instructive,
doesn't it?

163
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,110
I mean there's a 30 year period where 
there's tremendous intellectual clash,

164
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:29,430
say between a materialist and empirical 
perspective.

165
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,413
And in Russian Orthodox perspective,
the Russian Orthodox perspective loses 

166
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,414
its attractiveness for the reigning 
intellectual elite and the 

167
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:43,500
presuppositions of communism which 
appear rational by contrast,

168
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,310
which by all evidence we're not rushing 
to fill the gap.

169
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,280
And I want to read you something that 
nature wrote.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,530
It's perhaps the most famous thing he 
ever said.

171
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,810
Although it's almost entirely taken out 
of context and misquoted,

172
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,820
and if not,
ms dot quartered,

173
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,654
at least misunderstood.
Because nature was one of these strange 

174
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:05,290
people who was capable of living 50 or 
even 100 years into the future,

175
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,273
and although he was,
is generally regarded as an enemy of 

176
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:10,324
Christianity and superstition and was 
certainly an unbelievably outspoken 

177
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:14,464
opponent of Christian traditionalism,
he also knew that if you let the old 

178
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:19,564
gods die,
the probability that blood would flood 

179
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:24,580
the land was virtually 100 percent.

180
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,260
So let me read you what he wrote.
Have you not heard of that?

181
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:33,460
Mad Man who lit a lantern in the bright 
morning hours,

182
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,100
ran to the market place and cried 
incessantly.

183
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,620
I seek God as many of those who do not 
believe in God were standing around just

184
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,660
then he provoked.
Must much laughter.

185
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,020
Why did he get lost?
Said one.

186
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,680
Did he lose his way like a child said 
another or is he hiding?

187
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,543
Is he afraid of us?
Because he'd gone on a voyage or 

188
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,900
immigrated that's the yelled and 
laughed.

189
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,100
The Madman jumped into their midst and 
pierced them with his glances.

190
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,930
Where there is God,
he cried.

191
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,090
I shall tell you,
we have killed him.

192
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,970
You and I,
all of us are as murderers,

193
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,680
but how have we done this?
How are we able to drink up the sea?

194
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,310
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the 
entire horizon?

195
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,090
What did we do when we unchained this 
earth from its sun weather?

196
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,043
Is it moving now?
Whether are we moving now way from all 

197
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:26,614
sons?
Are we not plunging continuously 

198
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,630
backwards,
sideward,

199
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,900
forward in all directions?
Is there any opera down left?

200
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,260
Are we not straying as though through an
infinite nothing?

201
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,050
Do we not feel the breath of empty 
space?

202
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,243
Has it not become colder,
is not night and more night coming on 

203
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:53,440
all the while?
Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.

204
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,233
Do we not hear anything yet of the noise
of the grave diggers who are burying 

205
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:58,864
God?
Do we not smell anything yet of God's 

206
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:04,900
decomposition?
God's to decompose.

207
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,810
God is dead.
God remains dead.

208
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,560
We have killed him.
How shall we?

209
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:15,190
The murderer of all murderers,
comfort ourselves?

210
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,083
What was holiest and most powerful of 
all that the world has yet owned has 

211
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:23,170
bled to death under our knives who will 
wipe this blood office?

212
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,290
What water is there for us to clean 
ourselves?

213
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,483
What festivals of Atonement,
what sacred game show we have to invent 

214
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,970
is not the greatness of this deed too 
great for us,

215
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,720
must we not ourselves become God simply 
to seem worthy of it

216
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,573
allows you can tell.
That's a much different notion from the 

217
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:54,070
casual God is dead quotation that's most
generally associated with nature.

218
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,190
What?
What is he saying?

219
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,900
What he's saying?
Something like this.

220
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,350
A system like Christianity or any system
that's Qa,

221
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,460
that's oriented,
this society for thousands and thousands

222
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,294
of years,
can't simply be be eradicated by a 

223
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:15,890
casual gesture without consequences and 
suing and its aftermath.

224
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,610
What consequences will need?
She says,

225
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,550
well,
we'll no longer know up from down.

226
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,480
What does he mean by that 
metaphorically?

227
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,850
Well App.
That's where you're headed,

228
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,790
right and down.
That's what you want to stay away from,

229
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,624
and when you eradicate the most 
fundamental presuppositions of your 

230
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,980
system,
of values,

231
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,220
then there is no up and there is no down
and then where are you?

232
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,870
Precisely.
Well,

233
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,704
it's not so easy.
It's not so easy to say having not 

234
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,900
necessarily ever been in that position.

235
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,630
What is your life like when you don't 
know up from down?

236
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,464
Is it merely neutral is merely no value 
left or could it possibly be the case 

237
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,640
that if up and down and both being 
eradicated,

238
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,474
that the place that you're left and is 
something much more akin to a permanent 

239
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:07,721
state of suffering because maybe it's 
only the case that the constant capacity

240
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,404
to drive for up in being enough that you
believe in the constant striving for up 

241
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,250
is actually what makes your life 
bearable to you,

242
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,230
and if you lost the sense of up and 
down,

243
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,310
the place that you would end up would be
not so much neutral as terrible.

244
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,160
Now,
if you have any belief system at all,

245
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:25,994
you do this,
so let's say you're an advocate of 

246
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,214
leftwing politics.
You take a pro environmental stance or 

247
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:34,190
an anti corporate stance,
which is a relatively common thing to do

248
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,360
and long undergraduates.

249
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,450
What do you do when you hold that belief
system?

250
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,880
You view the world as it lays itself out
and you explained the manner in which it

251
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:47,510
manifests itself in terms of the axioms 
of that belief system,

252
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:50,240
and you may know that you can do it 
right,

253
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,540
you can tell a credible story about why 
the world is the way it is by adopting,

254
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,564
say,
an anti corporate perspective because 

255
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,474
there are all sorts of terrible things 
about the world that are a consequence 

256
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,044
say of corporate maneuvering,
and you might also say that and Piaget 

257
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:07,844
would say this,
that it's a necessary developmental 

258
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:14,600
stage to acquire allegiance to a given 
belief system.

259
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,280
Why?
Well,

260
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:20,270
any APP is better than none.
That might be the first observation,

261
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,104
so even if your belief system is 
relatively insufficient and easily 

262
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,170
challenged on intellectual grounds and 
perhaps not very complete anyways,

263
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,980
the fact that it does lay out a moral 
structure for you and tell you good from

264
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,410
evil and right from wrong,
that's a.

265
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,750
that's a plus.
That's an advantage.

266
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,130
Now it's relative intellectual weakness 
and it's incoherence.

267
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,710
Assuming it is incoherent to some 
degree,

268
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,040
that's a flaw,
but that doesn't mean that the effort to

269
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,470
establish a system like that is 
worthless.

270
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,453
It's worthwhile and need just said,
say with regards to Christianity and 

271
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,120
Europe,
he said,

272
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,510
well,
the errors,

273
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,463
intellectual and moral of Institutional 
Christianity are essentially beyond 

274
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,263
count,
but there's one thing you have to 

275
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,060
remember.
First of all,

276
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,894
in ordering of that sword is necessary 
because the alternative which is always 

277
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,100
hidden from you in so far as you're 
inside a moral system,

278
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,030
the alternative as far worse chaos 
that's worse.

279
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,273
I mean part of the reason that the 
Germans preferred Hitler to chaos was 

280
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:40,021
because they felt that the order that 
Hitler promised repressive as it was was

281
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:45,700
preferable to the chaos that was likely 
to ensue in its absence.

282
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,970
What is it about chaos that's so 
terrifying?

283
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,670
Second Nature said,
adopting a belief system of any sort and

284
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:03,534
imposing coherency on the world,
viewing it through the lens of that 

285
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:10,620
explicit system
disciplines your mind,

286
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,773
so for example,
to live in the absence of any stated 

287
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,963
beliefs is hardly to live at all.
To live in the presence of a narrow 

288
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,980
minded and extreme belief system is at 
least to undergo the rigors,

289
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,020
both behavioral and intellectual of 
coming to terms with the world from some

290
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:32,920
perspective.

291
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,940
Nisha said the reason that the modern 
mind such as it is,

292
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,720
was able to free itself from the past at
all,

293
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,260
was because it had first thoroughly 
subjected itself to the tyranny that was

294
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:51,704
imposed by the past in consequence,
disciplined itself developed enough 

295
00:19:56,151 --> 00:20:00,440
discipline as a consequence of that 
subordination to then break free of it.

296
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,753
In all the science of morals so far,
one thing was lacking strange as it may 

297
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,560
sound,
the problem of morality itself.

298
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,860
What was lacking was any suspicion that 
there was something problematic here.

299
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,580
Every society,
every functioning individual,

300
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,470
every functioning family,
every social unit has a moral code,

301
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,180
but they differ.
So what does that mean exactly?

302
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,530
Well,
it's complicated,

303
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:32,690
isn't it?
Because the fact of the university,

304
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,524
a lot of the code,
the fact of the code indicates that the 

305
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:41,480
code or code is necessary.
By the same token,

306
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,553
the fact that there's a multiplicity of 
codes seems to suggest that the 

307
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:49,150
particulars of a given aren't 
necessarily relevant,

308
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,740
and so niches says brilliantly,
I think we're faced with a problem.

309
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,460
No life without morality,
no absolute morality.

310
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,373
What do we do?
What are the things young observed was 

311
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,970
that if you look at the structure of 
stories,

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,833
you thought first there is a 
relationship between stories and moral 

313
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,070
codes.
Well,

314
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,990
seems relatively straightforward,
doesn't it?

315
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,990
If you tell a simple story like a 
parable,

316
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,990
sometimes they're complex to like an 
aesop fable safe.

317
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,730
What do you extract out from the story?
Moral?

318
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,633
What's the moral?
What's the implication of the story for 

319
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:26,910
behavior?
Right?

320
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,583
So you tell a little story about someone
who acts out of given moral code and 

321
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:35,070
that person does better or worse,
and the moral of the story is if you act

322
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,770
in this manner,
you will do better or worse,

323
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,830
proverbial knowledge.
We all tell stories.

324
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,003
They have identifiable structure.
You can tell that because it's a movie 

325
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,560
studio in Hollywood can produce a movie 
and people all over the world will watch

326
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,330
it.
People all over the world,

327
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,640
all over the world tell stories to one 
another.

328
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,290
The plot elements seem similar.
Morals,

329
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,410
similar.
That's a more difficult question,

330
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,370
right?
We know that the details of morality can

331
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:13,371
vary from culture to culture.
Is there anything that doesn't vary from

332
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,840
culture to culture?
How?

333
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,350
Why would you want to find that?

334
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,713
Hold on.
We'll xander knits and thought that one 

335
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:25,030
of the most important occurrences of the
20th century

336
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,780
or the Nuremberg trials,
the Nuremberg trials,

337
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:31,614
brought the perpetual perpetrators of 
the Nazi genocide to justice and it's 

338
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:38,454
easy to be cynical about that and 
perhaps you shouldn't be cynical about 

339
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:45,390
it because the victors brought the 
losers to trial,

340
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,224
and so of course the losers.
We're going to be tried from the 

341
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:53,250
perspective of the winters moral code,
but Solzhenitsyn says,

342
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:53,611
well,
wait,

343
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:56,790
you know,
there's something more to this story.

344
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,953
At least there seems to be in that many 
of the events that characterized the 

345
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,064
Nazi atrocities were so awful outside of
intellectual argumentation because you 

346
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:15,270
can provide an intellectual argument for
anything.

347
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,660
They were so awful.
The proper visceral embodied response of

348
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:25,500
any observer,
regardless of specific moral code,

349
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,020
should be repugnant,
period,

350
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,120
such that encoded,
at least initially in international law,

351
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,650
genocide is a crime against humanity,
right?

352
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,980
No matter what the particulars of your 
moral code so goes the logic.

353
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,053
You cannot construct a viable moral code
that enables genocide if not a logical 

354
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:52,414
impossibility.
And and I think it is a logical 

355
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,410
impossibility.
It's an ethical impossibility.

356
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,453
And then you have to ask yourself,
and this is not precisely an 

357
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:04,240
intellectual question,
does that seem credible to you?

358
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,870
Does it seem credible that there are 
acts that are so terrible that no one,

359
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,880
regardless of their stated position,
should ever engage in them,

360
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,720
and if the answer is yes,
then I would say,

361
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:21,554
well,
if you haven't moved towards personal 

362
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,210
except of acceptance of an ultimate up 
so to speak,

363
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,950
you've certainly identified at least one
down that you don't want to approach.

364
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,110
And that's the beginnings of the 
establishment of some notion of absolute

365
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,520
moral authority.

366
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,060
So what if we said hypothetically 
something like this.

367
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,950
Let's say that morality isn't a 
philosophy.

368
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,890
It's not something explicit,
something implicit.

369
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,960
How does it evolve?
Well,

370
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,333
emotional creatures produce it.
You don't have to produce it in 

371
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:04,230
isolation.
If you were wearing a social animal,

372
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:07,470
if you live a solitary and nocturnal 
existence by yourself,

373
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,393
there's no need for morality because you
don't have to regulate your behavior 

374
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:13,670
with regards to your peers,
but your social animals,

375
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:17,880
so you're stuck with everybody else,
but everybody else could be conceived of

376
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,500
as a grand average,
right?

377
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,200
How would you act towards the average 
person?

378
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,300
Well,
I would say that very,

379
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:28,530
very stable moral systems tell you 
exactly that and they say things like a

380
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,840
do unto others as you would have them do
unto you.

381
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,970
Right?
Basic principle of reciprocity.

382
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,800
Why does that work?
And it's a complex precept.

383
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,260
It means I should treat you like I would
like to be treated by you,

384
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,581
and you might think,
well,

385
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:45,414
that means to be nice to you,
but that isn't really what it means 

386
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,660
because nice isn't enough,
right?

387
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,080
What I want from you really is 
communication,

388
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:52,914
real communication feedback.
What am I doing that's acceptable and 

389
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:56,574
good?
What am I doing that's unacceptable and 

390
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,554
not good?
And that latter aspect of feedback as 

391
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:03,774
part of the reason why,
if you're a psychopathological and 

392
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,014
isolated,
you're in much worse shape because half 

393
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:12,990
of your sanity or three quarters of it 
or 90 percent of it,

394
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:13,824
who knows is distributed sanity.
You don't have to be that sane as long 

395
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:17,724
as you're hanging around other people 
because as soon as you do something 

396
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:20,274
that's deviant,
they're going to raise an eyebrow at 

397
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:22,740
you.
Right?

398
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,670
And then you think,
oh,

399
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:27,480
well not that.
And as soon as you do something good,

400
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,610
then they're going to pay more attention
to you and smile at you.

401
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:30,444
So all of the information about how to 
regulate yourself is out there in the 

402
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:35,430
world,
right?

403
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,383
The average person.
How many people do you interact with in 

404
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:40,280
a week?
300.

405
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,060
Say maybe it's not that many.
100.

406
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,810
How about year thousand?
2,000.

407
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,050
Five thousand,
10,000.

408
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,720
What do they all telling you?
Well,

409
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,260
the message is similar across people.
How similar.

410
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,540
Don't know exactly how similar that 
would stories tell you.
