1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,343
Apologies for my prolonged absence.
I've been dealing over the last few 

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,590
weeks with my somewhat shaky current 
health.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,350
It seems probable that I could use a 
rest if I had the opportunity and I knew

4
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,860
how I should probably be having a rest 
right now,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,233
but be that as it may,
I have prepared this letter 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
presumptuously to the world or at least 
to that corner of it with which I can 

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:30,471
communicate here at the dawn of the New 
Year in these perilous times,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,290
although I usually speak 
extemporaneously.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,000
That takes a level of capacity that I 
cannot quite currently manifest,

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,860
so I'm going to read instead.
It's also a careful argument,

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,843
I hope,
and it required the editing for which 

12
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,450
only the written word can suffice.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,720
Dear world.
On January 16th,

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,570
I'm going to talk with Sam Harris on his
podcast,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,823
waking up with Sam Harris.
Dr Harris is one of the so called new 

16
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,190
atheists,
of which there are four,

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,300
like the other three,
Christopher Hitchens,

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,940
Dan Dennett,
and Richard Dawkins,

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,863
who by the way,
I always wanted particularly to debate 

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,883
Dr Harris is a smart guy and I'm 
certainly not complaining that or will 

21
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,671
encounter him instead of darkens,
so I'm preparing my arguments carefully,

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,443
although I have been doing so for years.
The specific ideas I'm going to share 

23
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,224
with you today,
we're obsessing me from the moment I 

24
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,914
woke up somewhat fitfully this morning,
so I dictated them to my son and then 

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,934
edited them with his help.
The central problem of human beings 

26
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,980
isn't religion.
As the new atheists insist,

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,190
it's tribalism.
We know this in part because chimps,

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,770
our closest biological kin go to war and
they're not religious,

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,170
although they are tribal.
Tribalism also has a central problem and

30
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,004
it's not competition.
Despite the tendency of competition to 

31
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,920
produce at least temporarily,
winners and losers.

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,170
The problem of tribalism is cooperation 
because cooperation is what allows us to

33
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,344
exist is bounded groups.
A group by definition is a collective 

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,693
cooperatively aiming at something.
It can't be aimed at nothing because 

35
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:35,660
nothing cannot unite.
It only divides

36
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,383
thus attacks on collective purpose 
because of its tendency to produce 

37
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,130
tribalism.
Merely divide

38
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,653
the politics of identity which emerge 
when the central purpose is criticized 

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,753
to destructively inevitably produced the
situation described in the story of the 

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,710
Tower of Babel,
everyone fragments into primitive tribes

41
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,040
and speaks their own mutually 
incomprehensible language.

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,570
One alternative to fragmentation is of 
course,

43
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,620
union under a banner,
a collective ideal cause or purpose.

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,923
The problem with uniting under a banner 
as the postmodernist to push identity 

45
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:22,730
politics rightly pointed out,
is that to value something means similar

46
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:23,564
caneously to devalue other things.
Thus to value isn't exclusionary 

47
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:34,031
process,
but the alternative is valueless snus,

48
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,083
which is equivalent denialism and 
nihilism does not produce freedom from 

49
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,794
exclusion.
It just makes everyone excluded and 

50
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,980
that's an intolerable state 
directionless,

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,050
uncertain,
chaotic,

52
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,051
and angst ridden.
When such uncertainty reaches a critical

53
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:59,350
level,
the counter response appears first,

54
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,243
the unconscious,
and then the collectively expressed 

55
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:05,710
demand for a leader possessed by the 
spirit of totalitarian,

56
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,790
certainty who promises above all to 
restore order.

57
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,110
The society without a unifying principle
oscillates unmoored between nihilism and

58
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,064
totalitarianism.
Human beings have been wrestling with 

59
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,844
this problem since the beginning of 
civilization when our capacity to form 

60
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,864
large groups for all its advantages also
started to pose a new threat that the 

61
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,000
hyper domination of the state collective
or purpose,

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,553
but without the state,
there's just fragmentation into smaller 

63
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,014
groups.
The group itself cannot be done away 

64
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:44,950
with because for better or worse,
human beings are social animals,

65
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,630
not loners like sharks are.
Tigers were team players,

66
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,243
but being on one team means not being on
others just means that any given team 

67
00:04:55,031 --> 00:05:00,031
sidelines marginalizes and alienates 
those who cannot play their game as well

68
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,160
as conflicting with other teams in the 
West.

69
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,920
Starting in the Middle East,
thousands of years ago,

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,993
a new idea began to emerge.
Evolve is not too strong a word in the 

71
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,750
collective imagination.
You might following,

72
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,430
darkens.
Consider this a meme,

73
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,030
although this is far too weak a word
yes idea it.

74
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,993
Development can be traced back through 
Egypt and Mesopotamia before 

75
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,761
disappearing into unwritten history is 
that of the divine individual.

76
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,023
Just beyond old work of the imagination 
is a dramatic presentation of an 

77
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:41,640
emergent idea,
which is the solution to how to organize

78
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,580
social being without falling prey to 
nihilistic,

79
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:48,150
divisiveness or deceitful totalitarian 
certainty.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,970
The group must unite,
but under the banner of the individual,

81
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,493
the individual is the source of new 
wisdom that updates the antiquated 

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
nihilistic or totalitarian detritus and 
glory of the past.

83
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,173
For better or for worse,
that idea reaches its apogee and 

84
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,464
Christianity.
The divine individual is masculine 

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,753
because the feminine is not individual.
The divine feminine is instead mother 

86
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,920
and child.
However,

87
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,023
it is a hallmark of Christian 
supposition that the redemption of both 

88
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,744
men and women come through the masculine
and that's because the masculine is the 

89
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:36,444
individual.
The central realization express 

90
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,734
dramatically and symbolically is that 
the subordination of the group to the 

91
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,474
ideal of the divine individual is the 
answer to the paradox of nihilism and 

92
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,694
totalitarianism.
The divine individual is the man that 

93
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,501
every man admires and the man whom all 
women want their men to be.

94
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,803
The divine individual is the ideal firm 
which deviations are punished by the 

95
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
group with contempt and disgrace and 
fidelity to which is rewarded by the 

96
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,074
group with attention and honor.
The divine individual is not the winter 

97
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:20,194
of any individual game,
but the player who plays fairly and is 

98
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:28,600
there for continually invited to play.
The divine individual is the builder,

99
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,240
maintainer,
and expander of the state.

100
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,900
He who boldly goes where no man has gone
before and someone who eternally watches

101
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,590
over the widows and the children

102
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,640
is power of direct and honest 
communication is that which identifies,

103
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,683
discusses and then resolves the 
continually emergent problems of human 

104
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,364
existence.
It is for this reason that he is 

105
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:53,844
regarded as the savior of the world.
The primary image for women is not the 

106
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,770
divine individual because of the heavy 
burden they bear.

107
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:05,604
For reproduction,
it is instead the divine mother and 

108
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:09,414
child.
This is not to say that man is the 

109
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,164
divine individual and woman is not.
Although such confusion is 

110
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:18,630
understandable given the complexity of 
the problem.

111
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,863
Men like women have the divine mother 
and child as an element of their 

112
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,690
personality in man.
However,

113
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,880
it's in the background,
so to speak,

114
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,950
as the divine individuals in the 
background of the psyche for women,

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,000
men by necessity play a less primary 
role in the care of children.

116
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,183
This frees them to act as individuals in
a manner that up to now has been nearly 

117
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:45,804
impossible for women.
Identification with these images is 

118
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,710
belief in belief is not the statement of
agreement with a set of facts,

119
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,440
but the willingness to act something 
out,

120
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,830
to become something,
to stake your life on something

121
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,523
for men and women alike.
This means voluntary adoption of 

122
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,330
responsibility,

123
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,050
responsibility for oneself,
family and state.

124
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,410
It's in that responsibility and not in 
reits.

125
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,460
That meaning itself resides,
the meaning that makes life bearable.

126
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,893
Societies that refuse to honor both of 
these elements therefore doom their 

127
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:37,050
inhabitants to purposelessness 
unhappiness,

128
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,330
sterility and the aforementioned dangers
of nihilistic,

129
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,920
divisible and deceitful,
oppressive totalitarian,

130
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,754
certainty.
The meaning and responsibility is the 

131
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:52,994
necessary meaning in life
which can serve as a counterbalance to 

132
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:58,024
it's terrible fragility and tenuousness.
People must unite under the banner not 

133
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:08,020
of their group and not of nothingness,
but if the individual.

134
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,393
This is a brilliant and intrinsically 
paradoxical solution to the problems of 

135
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:20,481
nihilistic nothingness and too rigid 
group identity alike.

136
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,473
It's the consciousness of the individual
which transforms the chaos of potential 

137
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,853
into habitable cosmos.
Has the greatest origin stories 

138
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,174
repeatedly insist.
It is that same consciousness which 

139
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,194
stands up rebellious and revelatory to 
break down the pathological and too 

140
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,770
rigid order of that cosmos when it is 
become old,

141
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,100
infirm,
willfully blind and corrupt.

142
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,050
It is that consciousness which is the 
image of God.

143
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,870
It dwells within every embodied human 
form.

144
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,483
The fact of its existence is the reason 
that the law of the land itself must be 

145
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:13,970
bound by ultimate respect for the 
individual regardless of his or her sins

146
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:14,870
and crimes.

147
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,943
It is that consciousness,
not the objective material substrate of 

148
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:24,310
being which should be regarded as the 
ultimate reality.

149
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,223
There is no self evident reason why dad 
mattered should be given ontological 

150
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,004
primacy over living spirit.
Although doing so as produced a massive 

151
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,354
increase in human technological power,
it has left that power in the hands of 

152
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:45,561
an increasingly disenchanted populous 
and that presents a mortal danger.

153
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,213
Such power must be wielded by those who 
have truly and voluntarily accepted the 

154
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:57,070
responsibility of being less to prove 
fatal.

155
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,793
The West has long been the civilized 
embodiment of the idea of the divine 

156
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:10,161
individual who does exactly that.
That's what the voluntary lifting of the

157
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,060
cross of suffering symbolically 
represents.

158
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,653
For all its faults which are manifold,
the West has therefore served as a 

159
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:22,424
shining beacon of hope
to those destined to inhabit places too 

160
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:33,360
chaotic or too rigid for the human 
spirit to tolerate,

161
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,070
but the West is in grave danger of 
losing its way.

162
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,430
The negative consequences of this can 
hardly be overstated.

163
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,040
A close reading of 20th century history 
indicates as nothing else can,

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the horrors that accompany
loss of faith in the idea

165
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,070
of the individual.
It is only the individual.

166
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,180
After all who suffers,

167
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,350
the group does not suffer
only those who compose it.

168
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,550
That's the reality of the individual 
must be regarded as primary.

169
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,020
If suffering is to be regarded seriously
without such regard,

170
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,890
there can be no motivation to reduce 
suffering and therefore no respites.

171
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,373
Instead,
the production of individual suffering 

172
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,180
can and has
and will be again,

173
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:01,781
rationalized and justified for it 
supposedly benefits for the future,

174
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,353
and the group
effective birth control has emerged as 

175
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:21,190
one of the consequences of our powerful 
technological materialism.

176
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,613
This has been accompanied by the rise of
states efficiently civilized so that 

177
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,860
women who inhabit them can walk the 
streets,

178
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:30,694
unaccompanied in safety.
We do not yet know how to balance the 

179
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,104
opportunities provided for expanded 
female individuality with the eternal 

180
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,240
necessity for a woman to serve as the 
mother of the divine individual.

181
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,523
Dividing our civilization into polarized
ideological camps of female group 

182
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:51,920
identity and male group identity is 
certainly not the answer.

183
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,533
We have to be honest,
male and female alike about what we 

184
00:14:57,031 --> 00:15:00,480
really want as individuals and talk it 
out.

185
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,793
We know beyond dispute the societies who
emancipate their women are more 

186
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,770
productive and peaceful and that the 
relationship is causal.

187
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,813
That's not a matter of if but how
but such immense amounts of patient 

188
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,684
places a dual burden on the now more 
autonomous woman who is required to 

189
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:22,814
balance manifesting the potential of 
individual spirit within necessity of 

190
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,064
desire to bear and rear the next 
generation of mankind to live with free 

191
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,390
women,
gain the advantages of their freedom and

192
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:37,224
sophistication.
Man Must therefore bring their shadowed 

193
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:41,634
psychic identification with the divine 
mother and child into the light without 

194
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,270
losing their divine individuality in the
process.

195
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,840
They must consciously,
voluntarily,

196
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,883
deliberately and strategically except 
their responsibility for the 

197
00:15:56,851 --> 00:16:00,060
relationship between autonomous female 
companionship,

198
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,500
support,
love,

199
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,980
and the responsibility of producing that
next generation.

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,833
This means rejecting among other things 
the misbegotten idea of casual sexual 

201
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:16,821
gratification.
Sex is either the impulsive,

202
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,383
short term gratification of a 
domineering biological instinct or the 

203
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,570
Union of two conscious spirits taking 
responsibility for what they are doing.

204
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,323
The former is simply not commensurate 
with the demands of an advanced 

205
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:34,164
civilization which requires the adoption
of responsibility above all for its 

206
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,800
preservation,
maintenance,

207
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,663
and expansion.
It is for this reason that the 

208
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:49,050
sexualized interactions between young 
men and women in universities,

209
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,884
for example,
are increasingly and inevitably falling 

210
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:57,200
under the harsh and tyrannical 
regulation of the state.

211
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,760
In the West,
we are as well.

212
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,253
Shuttering are great cathedrals.
That was marvelous monumental 

213
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,694
embodiments of the idea of the divine 
individual on which our civilization is 

214
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:14,464
based.
This is no mirror practical material 

215
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,104
matter.
It's a symbolic and ideational process 

216
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:29,271
whose importance cannot be overstated.
Without that central idea,

217
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,020
we will dissolve and be lost.
It is time for each of us to consciously

218
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:40,464
realize what the great symbolic stories 
of the past insist upon that we are all 

219
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:50,550
sons and daughters of the divine logos,
consciousness itself,

220
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,193
bearers of it's light,
and that we must act in accordance with 

221
00:17:56,301 --> 00:18:00,110
that great central fact last,
all hell break loose.

222
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,340
This means above all to tell the truth 
and to care for one another,

223
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,863
starting at the level of the individual 
and proceeding from that out to the 

224
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:15,170
broader reaches of society itself.
The alternative,

225
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,900
as the same stories have always 
insisted,

226
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,813
is the more permanent instantiation of 
the horror that we already saw manifest 

227
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,380
in multiple forums in the last bloody 
terrible century.

228
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
We need to wake up individual man and 
woman alike and we need to do it now.

229
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,760
Each of us must take the world on her 
shoulders

230
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,153
in so far as we're capable of that and 
adopt individual responsibility for the 

231
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:58,390
horrors and suffering its existence 
entails

232
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,923
in that we will find the meaning without
which life is merely the suffering that 

233
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:10,131
breeds first resentment and then the 
desire for vengeance and destruction.

234
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,210
We need to take responsibility instead 
of incessantly insisting on our rights.

235
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,080
We need to become adults instead of aged
children.

236
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,860
We need to tell the truth.
We need justice and compassion,

237
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:36,534
conjoined,
not judgment in pity which crushing 

238
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,210
devour
so in the coming year.

239
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,350
Plan to make yourself a better person.
Fix what you can and would fix.

240
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,990
Start now.
There's something right in front of you,

241
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,010
demanding repair,
calling out to your conscience.

242
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,790
If you would only attend to it for your 
corrective efforts,

243
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,120
however primitive they may yet be.
Start small.

244
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,193
Have you mastered the process?
You can safely and competently expand 

245
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:23,544
your reach.
You will then be able to fix bigger 

246
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:30,030
things instead of making them worse and 
the arrogance of your ignorance.

247
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,143
If you do this,
there will be less pointless and 

248
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:44,151
unnecessary suffering in the world.
For all its shortcomings and faults will

249
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:50,711
be a better place
until we can imagine better than that.

250
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,230
That's meaning and purpose enough.

251
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,700
Happy New Year and best wishes to you 
all.
