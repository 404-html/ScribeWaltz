1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,613
One,
one person who visited me during the 

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,610
break had a question that was a good 
not,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,960
but all the other questions weren't 
good.

4
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,600
But this one is a question of good 
general relevance.

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,130
So do you want to repeat your question?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
People having but then dose those 
religion,

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,993
right?

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,060
Yeah.
Well it's a really good question.

9
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:37,894
So the question is,
Nisha said God is dead and he believed 

10
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,030
that things would fall apart as a 
consequence of that.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,980
And I'm claiming,
for example,

12
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:47,770
that people have an implicit religious 
structure and they act it out.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,813
Okay.
So there's actually a lot of things 

14
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:55,381
happened as a consequence of the fact 
that that's a reasonable issue.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,313
A good question.
So one of the things you might think 

16
00:00:58,811 --> 00:00:59,644
about is that,
so nature is claiming Dostoyevsky's 

17
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,524
claim were quite straight forward.
They said that once you took the 

18
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,740
foundation out of something,
it would fall out.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,250
It might take a long time to fall,
especially if it's a big thing.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:15,971
So,
you know,

21
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,350
you could make the claim,
for example,

22
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:22,351
that the Soviet Union basically fell in 
like 1970 but it took 19 years to topple

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:24,130
over because it's a big thing,
right?

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,230
It's,
it just doesn't crumble all at once.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,513
And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's claim 
would be once you hack out the basic 

26
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:31,984
assumptions and question them,
that it's only a matter of time until 

27
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:39,811
the entire structure decays.
And you could think that perhaps,

28
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,763
you know,
if you have a habit and then you become 

29
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,480
conscious of the habit and you practice 
a new habit,

30
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,314
then you can have a new habit.
And so what that means is that you can 

31
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:52,450
use your conscious mind to restructure 
your implicit beliefs.

32
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,284
It's hard.
Or you can use your conscious mind to 

33
00:01:55,121 --> 00:02:00,121
destroy your belief in the value of 
those implicit actions and demolish them

34
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,190
across time.
Okay.

35
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,024
So that could happen.
And I think to some degree that has 

36
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,364
happened,
it's certainly happened enough so that 

37
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:12,670
people are very confused about what they
believe or even about what belief means.

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,773
Cause there's a contradiction between 
what people think and there's a and how 

39
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,590
they act.
So,

40
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,030
okay,
that's one.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,970
Okay.

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,080
Tangent.
So to speak.

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,393
You,
and he actually took that question very 

44
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,380
seriously in some sense because the 
nature,

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,090
here's the floor niches argument.
I think it's like,

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,540
I hesitate to ever say that because like
I said,

47
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,310
he was a staggering genius.
So,

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,493
but nature believed his proposition was 
that once the religious edifice fell 

49
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,670
that people would have to create their 
own value.

50
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,504
So he believed that the over ma'am,
the superman so to speak would be a new 

51
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,363
type of human being,
like an existential type of human being 

52
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,620
who would be able to accept the fact 
that there was no ultimate meaning,

53
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,740
but create their own values.
Okay.

54
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,100
What the weird thing about that is you 
don't actually seem to create values.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,250
That's what,
that's where is flawed.

56
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:09,084
And I think that's where he implicitly 
accepted the presuppositions of the 

57
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,444
rationalists.
Because if there's no real source of 

58
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,270
value,
then it stands to reason that you create

59
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,160
values,
but you don't,

60
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,750
not easily like,
you know,

61
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,920
think about your own life.

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,753
You know?
So let's say you make a new year's 

63
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,101
resolution.
You say,

64
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,934
well,
I'm going to study like three hours a 

65
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,454
day.
It's like you're trying to create your 

66
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,650
own value structure,
right?

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,993
But then you find out it's a lot harder 
than you think because you don't listen 

68
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,470
to yourself.
It's like you wonder off and you know,

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,870
play video games or watch something on 
youtube,

70
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,040
you know,
and,

71
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,920
and you know,
why are you doing that?

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,710
Well,
it's because you're led by values.

73
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,390
You don't create them.
Now maybe there's a cocreation,

74
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,243
you know,
because it's not like you can't change 

75
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,014
yourself at all.
But we should be very careful before we 

76
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,834
jumped to the conclusion that values are
or even can be something that people 

77
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,624
actually create.
Now the phenomenologists like heidegger 

78
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,040
and young well would say,
no,

79
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,521
no,
let's,

80
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:14,521
let's just not get too hasty about 
making the presupposition that we can or

81
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,770
should create her own values.

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,933
Now,
one reason you might be hesitant to do 

83
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,370
that is that Hitler created is value,
so to speak.

84
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:28,540
And so did the Soviet communists and the
North Koreans.

85
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,374
You know,
they're trying to impose a rationalist 

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,630
value structure on a society and the 
consequences of that,

87
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,460
it'd be,
you know,

88
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,294
people debate about how many people died
in the Soviet Union as a consequence of 

89
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,704
internal repression.
And as the Marxist revisionists rally 

90
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,790
back to the original beliefs,
the estimate keeps going down.

91
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,460
But you know,
it was tens of millions of people.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,070
So,
and in China,

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,050
who knows,
it was maybe it was 100 million people,

94
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,110
it was a lot of people.
And then of course there's the Nazis it,

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,040
you know,
so the,

96
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,883
the,
the act of attempting to rationally 

97
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,990
constructed value system and then impose
it that it doesn't seem to work out very

98
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,010
well.
So,

99
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,690
you know,
on a sociological level,

100
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,680
we seem to have evidence that that's 
dangerous.

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,270
And then on a personal level,
it's like,

102
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,400
yeah,
you're so sure you create your values.

103
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,480
I would say to a large degree you 
discovered them.

104
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,510
And so,
you know,

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,553
here,
here's,

106
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,610
here's an experiment.
You can try one,

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,940
I told you last week I think to try to 
watch yourself speak for,

108
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,520
I think you should do it for the rest of
your life,

109
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,710
you know,
because words are very,

110
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,350
very,
very powerful and they lead you places.

111
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,090
So you should be careful how you use 
them.

112
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,924
But like here's another really 
interesting experiment is watch what 

113
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,930
you're interested in.
Try,

114
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,760
don't try to control it so much.
Just see where it is.

115
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:55,594
Because like in the phenomenologists 
certainly made much of this is like for 

116
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,570
them,
like for Heidegger,

117
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,883
value is something that manifested 
itself in the world and attracted your 

118
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,140
attention.
You know,

119
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,150
it wasn't something you precisely 
created.

120
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,610
Now I believe you have a hand in 
creating it.

121
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,950
We'll talk more about that later because
you're not,

122
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,890
you're not a deterministic entity.
Precisely.

123
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,200
So it's like you can participate in the 
construction of a value system,

124
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
but you know,
you have to take your biological nature 

125
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:25,904
into mind and you have to take your 
cultural nature into mind and you'll 

126
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,120
have to take other people into mind.
And so you know,

127
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,060
you have,
you can vary the game,

128
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,310
but I don't think you can really change 
the rules.

129
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,080
That's a reasonable way of thinking 
about it.

130
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,530
Now what you did in many ways was he 
said,

131
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:43,364
well,
maybe we have to go back down into the 

132
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,364
deep symbolic substrata of the human 
psyche to find the origin place of the 

133
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:56,660
ideas that we used to hold as religious.
It was a hypothesis in some sense,

134
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,494
and so there,
the psychoanalytic hypothesis is 

135
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,520
something like,
it's the,

136
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
it's the psychic substrata,
the pre linguistic psychic substrata 

137
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,140
that is the source of ritual symbol and 
religious ideas.

138
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,393
And so that you can go back to the 
source in a sense to revitalize those 

139
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,194
ideas.
And that strikes me as a wiser approach 

140
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,114
than the rational approach,
which says you can just create your 

141
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,930
values.
It's like we tried that.

142
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,650
It didn't work.
It really didn't work.

143
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,440
It was murderous.
So,

144
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,910
and then the,
the alternative,

145
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,000
the no value proposition as well,
then you're going to be nihilistic.

146
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:38,834
And that's not,
I think nihilism is a form of mental 

147
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,980
illness.
It's a sociological,

148
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,320
it it,
it's caused by sociological conditions,

149
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,180
but fundamentally it's a mental illness,

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,033
right?

151
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,013
You revise what you mean by believe.
That's part of it and that's what we're 

152
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,660
going to try to walk through.
You know,

153
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:06,330
this is a very,
this is a linear argument in some sense,

154
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:07,830
although there's going to be a lot of 
tangents.

155
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:08,664
I want to,
I want to show you how that might be 

156
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:16,020
done and what it might mean.
I mean,

157
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,760
who knows what it ultimately means,
right?

158
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,594
There's just no going there.
But my experience with these ideas have 

159
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,734
been that once you understand them and 
it's a different way of categorizing 

160
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,680
Shin,
I would say all sorts of things that you

161
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:31,020
didn't understand all of a sudden light 
up for you.

162
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,260
And it's really helpful,
you know,

163
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:35,094
because for,
let me just give you a couple of 

164
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:37,680
examples.
You know,

165
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:38,514
I would say that it's a unspoken 
proposition of much of today's 

166
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,893
sociobiological thinking that there's 
something pathological about human 

167
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,114
beings.

168
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,983
You know,
like I've heard people say like human 

169
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:53,694
beings are like a cancer on the planet.
It's like I went to a talk at Ted talk 

170
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,014
at Queens,
a Tedx talk where one of the professors 

171
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,220
who was a radical environmentalist of 
sorts,

172
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,800
you know,
he told the whole audience,

173
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,950
they were all people about your age,
that if they had any ounce of ethical,

174
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,860
if they had any ethical standards 
whatsoever,

175
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,840
they wouldn't reproduce.
It's like,

176
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,250
you know,
really he said,

177
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,084
well we've only had one child.
And for me I thought that was one child 

178
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,190
too many for him.
But you know,

179
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,024
I thought that's bloody pathological.
When you stand up in front of a whole 

180
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,294
bunch of young people who have their 
whole future in front of them and you 

181
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:32,401
say,
well,

182
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,234
you know,
you're such a horrid creature in your 

183
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:40,260
very core that it would be a moral 
violation for you to propagate.

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,030
Its like,
you know,

185
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,063
so I mean one of the things that that 
happened to me is like I kind of like 

186
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,600
people,
you know,

187
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,590
there are peculiar and weird like 
hippopotamuses and,

188
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,050
and rhinos and penguins and all that.
But you know,

189
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,960
I certainly don't think that we're some 
sort of cancer on the planet.

190
00:09:57,961 --> 00:09:58,794
I really think that's a,
that's a pre genocidal idea as far as 

191
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm concerned.
It's like the planet would be better off

192
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,120
without any people on it.
It's like,

193
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:06,954
Hey,
glad you're not near the old thermo 

194
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,460
nuclear button.
Yeah,

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
really,
really.

196
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,240
You know,
it's like that's an archetypal idea.

197
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,730
Fire will cleanse everything.
It's like,

198
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,564
that's what Hitler believed.
That's why all Berlin was burning when 

199
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:21,864
he committed suicide.
It's like that was what he was after 

200
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,370
from the beginning,
the cleansing fire.

201
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,610
It's like beware of those ideas,
boy.

202
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,390
You know?

203
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,223
And so I,
I can see the intrinsic dignity of 

204
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,554
people and,
and their intrinsic value and how that 

205
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,820
can be expressed across time.
And you know,

206
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,200
and I value that.
It's,

207
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:40,741
it's,
it's,

208
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:44,130
it's something pristine and,
and remarkable,

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,081
you know?
And,

210
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:47,820
and understanding,
I believe that understanding these ideas

211
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,190
property can give you that kind of 
orientation,

212
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,881
you know?
I mean,

213
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:53,160
everybody's flawed and useless and half 
crazy.

214
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean,
obviously,

215
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,880
but you know,
that's not exactly the point.

216
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,790
There are reasons we are flawed and 
useless and half crazy.

217
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,743
You know,
life is hard and we're finite and we 

218
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,923
know.
So we have big problems that confront 

219
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,754
us.
It's like,

220
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,300
I don't think any sane person cannot be 
crazy so to speak.

221
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,613
But having said all that,
the idea that there's something 

222
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,960
intrinsically pathological about human 
beings like that is an absolutely,

223
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,490
what's the word?
Apocalyptic idea.

224
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,240
It's like beware of people who tell you 
such things,

225
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,530
you know?
So,

226
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,260
and it's certainly not something you 
should be thinking about yourself.

227
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,080
God.
It's like who knows what you're up to.

228
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,150
You know?
Maybe some of you will be great people,

229
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,530
you know,
good luck with it.

230
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,723
So,
so I want to walk you through what I 

231
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,494
think these ideas mean.
And I'm not asking you to believe 

232
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,410
anything I tell you.
It's like don't hack away at it,

233
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,780
man.
See if you can see where it's flawed.

234
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,470
I can't,
I've tried.

235
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,580
So cause I don't want to be standing on 
sand.

236
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,403
And so what I've tried to do is to look 
at human history and prehistory and to 

237
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,400
see what it is that we need to move 
forward.

238
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,950
And we have to be united with our 
history.

239
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,784
Human beings are historical creatures.
And so if there's a divide between us 

240
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,534
and our history,
then all sorts of weird ideas are going 

241
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,120
to invade us.

242
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,433
You know?
It's like,

243
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,320
it's quite funny because again,
with the rationalists atheists,

244
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,060
you know,
they basically think that if we dispense

245
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:22,894
with religion,
everybody would turn into Rene 

246
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Descartes.
You know?

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
It's like we'd be all rational.
It's like,

248
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,700
are you out of your bloody mind?
Look at the new age people,

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,950
you know?
That's where we'd be going first.

250
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,420
It's like we'd be like,
Shirley,

251
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,960
what's your name?
Mclean who I read once believed that the

252
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:42,340
reason that there were so many allergies
in San Francisco was because of aliens.

253
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,040
It's like,
oh,

254
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,440
that's a much more likely place for 
human belief systems to end up.

255
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,010
Then like,
poof,

256
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,480
we're all rene decartes.
Like,

257
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,250
that's not going to happen.
You know,

258
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,410
one of the things young said,
which I just loved,

259
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,244
he said,
the purpose of religious structures is 

260
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,290
to stop people from having religious 
experiences.

261
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,400
That's a smart,
that's smart saying.

262
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
So anyways,
so we're going to walk through this and,

263
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,840
well,
you know what I,

264
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,280
what I've come to believe is that the 
archetypes we're going to talk about,

265
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,123
because I believe they archetypes is 
pretty good way of thinking about them 

266
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,480
constitute the fundamental presumptions 
of human being.

267
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,340
You,
you can't not presume them.

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,780
That's why the religious,
you can't escape from them.

269
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,763
Now that doesn't mean they're right,
but it means that there as right as we 

270
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,340
are.
And how right are we?

271
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,380
Well we don't know.
You know,

272
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,214
I mean there were people that I read,
somebody's in the 1970s he was a 

273
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,014
journalist,
he wrote a book called the ghost in the 

274
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,540
machine.
You know,

275
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,400
and,
and this was a fairly common proposition

276
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,830
at the time.
His idea was that,

277
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,641
well,
you know,

278
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:54,580
we're animals that have become self 
conscious and that may be strictly drove

279
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,750
us incurably insane.

280
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,913
And so we're like an evolutionary dead 
end and it's only a matter of time 

281
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,080
before we extinguish ourselves.
It's like that's possible.

282
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,943
You know,
no other animal has ever become self 

283
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,250
conscious.
It's a big burden,

284
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,553
you know,
and it does drive people kind of crazy 

285
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,650
and no wonder,
you know,

286
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,484
cause you have to contemplate your 
mortality all the time or at least some 

287
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,814
of the time.
And also you're completely aware of how 

288
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,484
useless and ugly and you know all these 
other things you are compared to 

289
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,980
whatever the ideal might be.
It's a lot of burden.

290
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,623
But it seems to me to that human beings 
are peculiar in that we can actually 

291
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,820
choose,
we have some facility for choice.

292
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,610
I think we could decide whether we're an
evolutionary dead end or not.

293
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,030
And I also believe that grounding our 
thinking in these ancient ideas makes it

294
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:42,070
far more likely,
far less likely that we're going to fall

295
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,460
prey to ideological possession,
which is extraordinary dangerous.

296
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,473
And it'll also give us the metta 
framework to conceptualize what might 

297
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,900
constitute ideal and well.
So you know,

298
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:54,734
that's cause I wanted to,
I wanted to find out what's an 

299
00:14:56,451 --> 00:15:01,220
alternative cause videology and nothing 
is the wrong answer because people can't

300
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:04,040
live on nothing.
Life is too hard.

301
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,290
You have to see that your being is 
justifiable in order to thrive.

302
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,560
And given that your being is 
characterized by suffering,

303
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,380
that's no easy matter,
suffering and limitation.

304
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,214
That's the basic truths of life.
It's a Buddhist doctrine for that 

305
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,634
matter.
Right?

306
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,250
And it's,
it's not,

307
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,010
it's certainly not something that the 
Jews would disagree with.

308
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,080
And it's central to Christian thinking 
as well.

309
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,640
You know,
most religious structures thing,

310
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,080
you're doomed and there's going to be a 
lot of pain along the way.

311
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,800
It's like,
yeah,

312
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,670
that's true.
Okay,

313
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:40,630
now we've got that out in the open.
What do you do about it?

314
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,903
Well,

315
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,650
that's the question.
So let's see,

316
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,300
what do we have for time?
It's three 45 is that about right?

317
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,950
This old computer?
I'm not sure it's accurate.

318
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,580
Yeah.
Okay,

319
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,413
so question.

320
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Yeah,
I guess now that we've conceptualized it

321
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,390
as a problem,
it is.

322
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,160
Oh yeah.
Well the thing is,

323
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,994
you know,
sometimes conceptualizing a problem 

324
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,703
brings it into focus.
There are multiple ways things realize 

325
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,734
themselves,
right?

326
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,060
You know,
you know how it is.

327
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,710
If you,
if you learn something complex,

328
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,544
you think you've learned it,
and then a little later you articulated 

329
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,401
more.
Or do you think,

330
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:16,850
oh,
I,

331
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,700
I didn't understand that completely.
And then you know,

332
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,560
you think you've got it.
And in three years later you think,

333
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:23,060
oh no,
I really didn't quite have that.

334
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm going to articulate it more.
So knowledge comes into focus and so,

335
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,510
okay,
so let's move away from,

336
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,670
from the this philosophy,
philosophical,

337
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,800
evolutionary discussion for a moment.
I want it,

338
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,140
I want to start again with a series of 
propositions.

339
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:36,974
So

340
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,533
330

341
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,290
it's three.
Oh,

342
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:42,920
okay,
good,

343
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,753
good,
good.

344
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,960
Three 38 all right,
fine.

345
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:49,961
So now when I first started to construct
this representation,

346
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,683
I'd been reading heavily a book called 
the neuropsychology of anxiety that's 

347
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,384
written by Jeffrey Gray.
Jeffrey Gray was one of hands ising 

348
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:02,484
students.
And Isaac was one of the other founders 

349
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,980
of modern psychometric personality 
theory for a long time.

350
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,080
He was the most cited psychologist in 
the world.

351
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,320
And Jeffrey Gray was no,
Jeffrey Gray who died recently was a,

352
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,210
he was a literate guy.
Man.

353
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,253
The neuropsychology of anxiety is a 
tough read because he was sort of a 

354
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:25,750
master of neuropharmacology neuro 
anatomy,

355
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,203
neuro psychology and animal behavior.
So he's a behaviorist and cybernetic 

356
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,334
theory,
although I don't really think he knew 

357
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,720
exactly that he was a cybernetic 
theorist.

358
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,613
He sort of knew it.
It took me a long time to figure out 

359
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:41,954
that he was a cybernetic theorist.
Cybernetics emerged as a consequence of 

360
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,410
the work of someone called Norbert 
Wiener,

361
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,244
who was an,
who was at mit and he wrote a book 

362
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,660
called,
I think he wrote,

363
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,680
I think the book was called cybernetics 
actually.

364
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,420
Anyways,
you can look them up.

365
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,100
Um,
and there are cybernetic principles that

366
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:02,934
I extracted out of gray and it started 
to utilize and then I only found out 

367
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,230
later that they were actually

368
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,010
consequences of whiners thinking now.
And he infected lots of people.

369
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:12,844
So luria who was a great Russian nurse,
neuro psychologist was basically a 

370
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,610
cybernetic system.
There was a couple of other Russians,

371
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,910
Sokolov and vinegar Dova who discovered 
the orienting reflex,

372
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:22,744
which was like,
that was like discovering a new planet 

373
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:26,920
or a new continent.
It's like an important discovery.

374
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,420
They should've got the Nobel prize for 
it.

375
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,490
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a big deal.

376
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,833
And so Norbert Wiener cybernetic thought
really spread everywhere and it like 

377
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,360
pops up.
Piaget is cybernetic in many ways.

378
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,880
And there's,
there's modern personality theories that

379
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:40,714
are fundamentally cybernetic.
So this is basically a cybernetic model 

380
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,183
and cybernetics,
cybernetic models hypothesize that 

381
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,523
active organisms,
they basically perform according to the 

382
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:54,874
following.

383
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,180
Yeah,

384
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Schema.
They paused at a target and move towards

385
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,234
it and then they regulate themselves so 
they don't deviate too much from the 

386
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:08,484
trail.
So that's what this is as far as I'm 

387
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,090
concerned.
So,

388
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,983
so here's,
here's the basic framework within which 

389
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:18,060
you live as far as I can tell and I 
don't think you can get out of it.

390
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,540
And you carry this frame with you all 
the time and you're looking at the world

391
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,374
through it.
And the framework has a couple of 

392
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,770
substructures and one is you have some 
sense of where you are.

393
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,730
And that's like a theory.
It's a theory of where,

394
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,400
who you are and where you are.
It's a theory of the present.

395
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,443
These are the present conditions.
Now you might think you observe the 

396
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:44,550
present around you and those are factual
observations.

397
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,280
And so your conceptualization of the 
present isn't a theory.

398
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
It's a fact.
But don't be thinking that,

399
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,880
you know,
it's a theory.

400
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,743
You might be wrong about the present.
The person you're in love with might be 

401
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,420
having an affair,
right?

402
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,320
So there can be massive gaps in your 
assumptions about the present.

403
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,880
You know,
you think you're healthy,

404
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,410
but maybe you're not,
you know,

405
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,750
you think your boss likes you,
but maybe they don't.

406
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,340
You think your degree is going to be 
useful,

407
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,230
but maybe it isn't.
You know?

408
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,170
Well it's just,
it's just,

409
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,050
it's just a straight forward 
observation.

410
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:19,860
But it's an important one.
You could be wrong about now.

411
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,783
Okay.
Cause one of the things we're going to 

412
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,490
try to figure out is where is it that 
you could be wrong and what does it mean

413
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,260
that you could be wrong?
All of those places.

414
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,990
And what should you do about the fact 
that you could be wrong?

415
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,823
All those places.
And then we're also going to try to 

416
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:37,050
figure out what happens if you find out 
that you're wrong.

417
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,160
So,
for example,

418
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,050
you're going out with someone you love 
them,

419
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,510
perhaps they've made promises to you and
you know,

420
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,373
poof,
you find out that they'd been having an 

421
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,200
affair with three people for the last 
five years.

422
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,320
It's like,
hey,

423
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,800
you're wrong.
And so now where are you?

424
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,560
What does that mean that you're wrong?
Well,

425
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:54,394
it means a lot of things.
It means you're means a lot of things 

426
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:57,904
that you,
it might mean a lot more things that it 

427
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,300
means,
which is a very strange thing,

428
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,180
might mean that you're so clueless as is
just mind boggling,

429
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,100
you know,
and that you're blind as a bat.

430
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,293
So that's one possibility and that 
you're like that and you've always been 

431
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,350
like that.
You better do something about it quick.

432
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,070
That's a possibility might be that you 
hooked up with a psychopath,

433
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,233
right?
Which is also something that you should 

434
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:17,884
avoid.
And but that would mean you don't 

435
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,390
understand people well enough to know 
when they're psychopaths or not,

436
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:25,510
or maybe that your fatally attracted to 
them in some bizarre way.

437
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,733
You know?
It also means that whatever future you 

438
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:31,180
were envisioning that was really a 
delusion because that's gone.

439
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,030
And it also means that you've blown out 
most of your past,

440
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:34,864
at least in so far as that relationship 
was part of your past because nothing 

441
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,030
that you thought was happening was what 
was happening.

442
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,320
So then you might think one moment 
you're somewhere,

443
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,590
then you get the realization and the 
next moment you are somewhere else.

444
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,143
And so one of the things I would propose
to you is that those are actually two 

445
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:59,140
important places.
The one place is the place you are,

446
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,120
when what you're doing is working.

447
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,700
And the other place is the place you are
when what you're doing is not working.

448
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
And I would also say in some weird 
sense,

449
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:13,360
those are permanent places.
And I'll tell you why I think this,

450
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,194
but I think they're akin in some manner 
to explored territory and unexplored 

451
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,504
territory.
And that's their sort of biological 

452
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,724
basis.
Because we know that animals are 

453
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,140
territorial,
right?

454
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,810
Almost every animal has a sketched out 
territory.

455
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,313
Um,
if social animals have to organize 

456
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,064
themselves within that,
toward territory with other creatures 

457
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:32,764
like them.
So part of their territory is almost 

458
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,810
always a dominance hierarchy,
but they have a territory and they don't

459
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:39,490
like going outside of it.
So I can,

460
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,730
I can give you an example.
So my,

461
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,983
my parents have that dog and a cat and a
that my dad used to take the dog for a 

462
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:50,380
walk all the time,
but the cat really liked the dog.

463
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,360
And so it was kind of irritated that the
dog would leave.

464
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,990
And so the cat started following my dad 
around on his walks.

465
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:56,824
And so it was really interesting because
the first thing the cat did was when it 

466
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,990
was following,
it wasn't right behind the dog.

467
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,883
There's no way it was going to do that.
It would slink along all of the 

468
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:06,214
building.
So it would follow about 30 feet behind 

469
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,630
and it would keep one side right against
a building.

470
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,200
And then it would sort of zip across the
intervening spaces of the houses.

471
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,640
Right.
And you might think,

472
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,690
well,
why was it doing that?

473
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:21,010
And the answer is it didn't know where 
the bloody predators were.

474
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:21,844
Didn't know where the big dogs were.
It didn't know anything about the new 

475
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:24,634
places it was going.
So it was going to stick inside against 

476
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,244
one hard wall so that the complexity was
cut in half and it was going to go 

477
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,830
really slow on the off chance that some 
massive hound came out and ate it.

478
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,650
So it was being very careful.
So that was pretty cool.

479
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,484
So it did that for quite a while and 
then because nothing massive jumped out 

480
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,014
and ate it and because it started to 
understand that territory knew where it 

481
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:50,540
could hide.
It got a little braver and over a couple

482
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,490
of months it got to the point where it 
actually follow the,

483
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,470
the dog because it had mastered,
it's expanded its territory and mastered

484
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:01,250
its knowledge of the territory.
But then I was walking with them one day

485
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,660
and they had a route,
Hey,

486
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,763
and my dad had the dog and he wanted to 
take the dog a little farther than he 

487
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:07,784
would normally go with the dog.
And so he was taking the dog across the 

488
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,144
street,
but the cat just stayed on the corner 

489
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,890
and cried because it,
you know,

490
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:14,724
it was meowing obviously,
but it was very upset because it wasn't 

491
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,450
going out into that weird new place that
it had no knowledge about.

492
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,650
And so it was,
you know,

493
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,300
making its fear really known and animals
are like that,

494
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,070
you know?
So here's something to think about.

495
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:28,904
This blew me away when I first 
conceptualized it was one of the things 

496
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,144
that made me understand that 
psychologists are always asking 

497
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,560
questions backwards.
I,

498
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,150
I'll give you an example.
It's like,

499
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,930
why do people take cocaine?
That's a question,

500
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,970
right?
I think it's a good question.

501
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,923
It's a stupid question.
The question is why doesn't everybody 

502
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:51,770
take cocaine all the time?
That's the question.

503
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,270
Because we know what cocaine does,
right?

504
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,133
It,
it activates the primary incentive 

505
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:57,914
reward systems and almost everything you
do is in an attempt to activate the 

506
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,434
primary incentive reward system.
So you've got this white powder and it 

507
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:08,180
is,
it's like you should be,

508
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:11,720
knows deepen that stuff nonstop,
but you're not,

509
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,690
why?
What's wrong with you people,

510
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,920
you know?

511
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,753
So,
so that's one example of where 

512
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,330
psychology is got,
it's got it backwards.

513
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,310
We know why people take intoxicating 
drugs.

514
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:25,850
It's dead simple.
Sometimes it reduces their anxiety,

515
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:26,684
sometimes it reduces their pain.
Sometimes it cranks up their incentive 

516
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:30,530
reward systems.
You know,

517
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,080
it hijacks the system,
it does it biochemically,

518
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,010
perfectly obvious.
So that's one example.

519
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,350
Now another example is this.
How do animals learn fear?

520
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,810
It's a prime behavioral question,
right?

521
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,850
It's the wrong question because it 
presumes that the,

522
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,110
the standard animal is calm.
Why would you presume that?

523
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,123
Why wouldn't we presume instead that the
standard animal is terrified and that 

524
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:06,800
the animal only learns how not to be 
terrified with difficulty and under very

525
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,440
restricted circumstances?
Well,

526
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,270
that's a much better way of thinking 
about it.

527
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:14,720
And it makes a lot more sense because 
the animals in danger,

528
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,400
especially if it doesn't know its 
territory.

529
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,233
So,
so here's how you teach an animal to be 

530
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,144
afraid.
If you're a behaviorist and I am not 

531
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,364
making fun of behaviors,
a lot of what I've learned about 

532
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,430
psychology that's actually real has come
from behavior.

533
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,410
It's like they're rigorous scientists 
and,

534
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,643
and they learned an awful lot from 
analyzing animal behavior that was 

535
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,093
incredibly profound.
And they laid the ground for modern 

536
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,490
neuroscience,
the real stuff,

537
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,290
not the FMRI stuff.
You know,

538
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,820
the real stuff.
So,

539
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:41,654
okay,
so basically what you do to train an 

540
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,770
animal to be afraid is you take a rack,
let's say,

541
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,340
and the rats in this cage,
and you put,

542
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,520
you put a little electric shock pad in 
the rats cage,

543
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:54,354
so maybe electrifies the bottom a little
bit and you turn on a light and you 

544
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:01,740
electrify the bottom and the rat jumps 
into the air and then you shut it off.

545
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,600
And then you wait a while and then you 
do the same thing,

546
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,463
turn on the light,
then you turn on the electric electric 

547
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,860
shock mechanism and the wrap jumps in 
the air and you do that 10 times.

548
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,620
And then when you turn on the light,
the rat goes like,

549
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:16,740
this freezes because it's learned,
right?

550
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,750
Light equal shark.
Everyone knows that,

551
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,370
you know,
that's basic conditioning.

552
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,683
Um,

553
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,970
so the rats learn to be afraid.
Okay,

554
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:27,740
that makes sense.
Except,

555
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,150
okay,

556
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,580
here's your experimental box,
right?

557
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,043
You got the electrification going on in 
there and you grab your rat and you 

558
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,230
dropped me in the cage.
What does he do first?

559
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,810
He freezes because he's afraid.
He's afraid.

560
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,280
As soon as you put them in the new 
environment,

561
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,760
that's the normal route.
The normal rat.

562
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,650
It's like this.
And why is that?

563
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,640
Because things like to eat rats.
So you know they don't like light.

564
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,713
They like it dark and they don't like 
being exposed and they don't like being 

565
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:03,420
the new damn cage because God only knows
what's in that cage.

566
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,600
And so the a priori rat is this.
So then what is the wrap do?

567
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:14,310
Well it's like this for quite a while.
It can be really a long time.

568
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:15,144
I'll tell you a story about that.
He's like this and then maybe he sniffs 

569
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,520
cause rats mostly knows.

570
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,980
Most animals are mostly smell oriented,
right?

571
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,590
Human beings are weird because we're 
visually oriented,

572
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,780
but almost all animals,
it's all smell.

573
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,050
Their whole brains are organized around 
their olfactory system.

574
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:34,500
So it sniffs and if it can't smell 
anything,

575
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:35,281
rats,
man,

576
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,114
they can smell.
So there's experiments indicating that 

577
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,963
if you take a rat and you poison it and 
then it gets sick and another rat has 

578
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,004
smelled it's breath,
that rat will not eat the poison that 

579
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:47,364
the first route eight.
Now that's why it's hard to get rid of 

580
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,320
rats.
They're smart and they have great senses

581
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:53,154
of smell.
So the rats checking out like is there 

582
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,940
anything here that smells like something
that might eat me?

583
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,953
So cats for example,
rat doesn't ever have to meet a cap to 

584
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:02,700
be afraid of it's odor.
Rats,

585
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,534
hate cat odor.
And so you can take rats in it like a 

586
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,743
box and blow a fan over a cat so that 
the odor wafts into the box and let's 

587
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,780
like the rats are all like this because 
God only knows what a cat smells like to

588
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:17,010
Iraq,
but it ain't good.

589
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,500
Whatever it is.
So the rats like this,

590
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,770
then he sniffing and he's looking around
and if nothing happens then he starts to

591
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:27,090
relax a little bit,
but not that much.

592
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:30,840
He still crouched down and he's still at
the attended of rat.

593
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,870
And then he starts to look around a bit 
and then he starts to loosen up and then

594
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:34,704
maybe he starts to move.
And his theory is possibly it's safe 

595
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:39,840
enough here.
So Iraq,

596
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,090
that's careful,
can move and nothing painful or damaging

597
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:43,924
will happen.
And then he starts to move and nothing 

598
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:46,504
happens.
And then he spends a bunch of times 

599
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,870
sniffing around every corner of the 
cage.

600
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,790
And you know,
sooner or later he thinks

601
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,750
rats aren't going to die here now.
And then he's sort of a relaxed rat.

602
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,660
And then the behavior says,
you are now a normal rat.

603
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,793
We can teach you to be afraid.
It's like you don't have to teach me to 

604
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,840
be afraid.
I know how to be afraid.

605
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,003
I have to learn how not to be afraid.
Now that's a good way of thinking about 

606
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:12,164
your brain.
So you could think about the underlying 

607
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:19,280
motivational and emotional systems in 
your brain as default on systems.

608
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,450
They're like a nuclear reactor,
like the core of a nuclear reactor.

609
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,950
You're ready,
man.

610
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,940
Except when other parts of your brain 
you're telling you just to keep it calm.

611
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,820
So,
but you don't need to learn to be afraid

612
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,470
any more than you need to learn to be 
hungry.

613
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,010
You need to learn how to be calm and 
secure.

614
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,550
And that's really worth thinking about 
because you got to ask yourself,

615
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:41,384
for example,
why are you calm and secure in this 

616
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:44,744
class?
What are the preconditions for you not 

617
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:49,760
being afraid here?
So we'll think about it.

618
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:50,780
Why are you not afraid?

619
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,000
Well,
the floor is solid.

620
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,493
That's a good one.
The roof is probably not going to 

621
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,340
collapse.
Why?

622
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,223
Well,
it's actually because you could rely on 

623
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:06,080
the structural engineers who built the 
building.

624
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,480
That's kind of interesting.
Why?

625
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,913
You know,
in the Soviet Union they used to make 

626
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,330
cinder block buildings out of old 
radioactive waste.

627
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,643
And then of course they put way too much
sand in them so that if the earth went 

628
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,000
like this once,
it'd be like collapse.

629
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,300
And so the typical Soviet couldn't be 
reasonably fearless in this room because

630
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:27,854
the walls were radioactive and if the 
earth moved a little bit to this whole 

631
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:30,434
thing would collapse.
And so part of the reason that you can 

632
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:32,954
sit in here without fear is because the 
system that regulates our construction 

633
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:40,250
enterprise is actually not very corrupt.
So that's pretty cool.

634
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,750
So you know,
also we can think about that.

635
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,583
That means that one of the preconditions
for your relative fearlessness is your 

636
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:49,190
implicit belief that the builders who 
built this building can be trusted.

637
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,410
And that's really unlikely.
You know,

638
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:55,880
if you look around the world,
how many countries are there that aren't

639
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,470
corrupt?
I mean,

640
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:58,850
you know,
the West is corrupt too.

641
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,713
There's no doubt about it.
But compared to our really corrupt 

642
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,170
place,
you know,

643
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,290
we don't even register as corrupt.
So what else?

644
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,150
Well,
look at the people around you.

645
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,760
You know,
you guys look a lot the same.

646
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,830
All things considered,
you know,

647
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,800
none of you or have painted your face in
rainbow colors and you know,

648
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:16,634
you're not decorated with ostrich 
feathers and you're not wearing some 

649
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:22,350
outlandish victorian costume and none of
you are stark naked.

650
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,430
And most of you aren't foaming at the 
mouth than you know,

651
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,323
like fundamentally you're in a uniform 
and there's some variation of the 

652
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:30,650
uniform allowed.

653
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,990
But not much.
How many of you are wearing jeans?

654
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,530
Right?
It's like 50% of you.

655
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:37,364
Why are you wearing jeans?
It's so other primates think you're 

656
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,334
insane.
That's why I'm telling you it's a big 

657
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,510
part of it.
It's,

658
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,343
it's acceptable.
And so most of you are wearing clean 

659
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:50,210
jeans,
I presume,

660
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,240
or they're cleaned enough anyways so 
that if they're not clean,

661
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,074
it's not detectable,
which is another sign that you're not 

662
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,280
completely insane.
Right?

663
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,533
And so you're manifesting markers like 
mad that you're basically a normal 

664
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,543
primate and that you live in accordance 
with a set of well understood implicit 

665
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:10,820
rules.
And that for the purposes of this set of

666
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:13,430
interactions,
you're not going to violate them.

667
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,730
So everybody can come in here like the 
terrified primates.

668
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,770
They are the first class and they can 
look around.

669
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:22,970
They see the desks are all in order.
So that means order prevails here.

670
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,830
The desks all facing this way.
So it's a standard lecture theater.

671
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,260
You know what's going to happen here.
People walk in,

672
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:34,190
they all sit properly in their tables,
most of them don't talk.

673
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,183
There's another rule.
How many of you are sitting in the same 

674
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,860
chair that you sat in last week,
right?

675
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:42,530
And you know pretty soon you're going to
figure out which chairs years.

676
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,900
And then if someone comes in here and 
sits in your chair,

677
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,730
you're going to think that person's in 
my chair.

678
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,013
And you know the reason for that is is 
you're trying to stabilize the 

679
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:50,984
environment.
You've learned that that chair is safe 

680
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,523
and so are the people around you.
And so now you feel kind of comfortable 

681
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,790
in that chair.
You sort of think it's your chair.

682
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,253
And so we do everything we can to 
structure the environment so that 

683
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,450
signals that you're safe are radiating 
at you like mad.

684
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,673
And that way you can be calm enough 
despite the fact that you're a crazy 

685
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:13,754
chimpanzee.
You can be calm enough to sit here and 

686
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,294
not be distracted by fundamental 
motivational systems that are out of 

687
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,194
control and maybe listen and attend.
And like you just think about how much 

688
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:27,860
work.
Just think about it,

689
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,150
how much work went into building this 
room for you to sit in?

690
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,670
You know,
it's like they're being universities for

691
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,504
about a thousand years.
So there's a thousand year conceptual 

692
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,820
history of the university.
That's one of the preconditions.

693
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:41,654
And then we had to figure out how to 
make all this stuff and then people 

694
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:47,840
actually had to put it together and then
you all had to be socialized for like 19

695
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:48,674
years so that you could sit here 
relatively quietly while you're 

696
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,910
listening to a lecture.
And you know,

697
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:53,744
we had to build the idea of the 
university into our culture and you 

698
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:58,970
know,
somebody's got to keep the lights on and

699
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,890
look at this technology that works.

700
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,890
It's like there are people out there 
just slaving themselves to death to make

701
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:06,734
sure that this little box that you're 
sitting in is sufficiently predictable 

702
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,980
so that you don't have to be terrified.
It's like good for them,

703
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,233
you know?
And it's all happening so invisibly 

704
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:18,261
that,
you know,

705
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:19,094
you're probably irritated because your 
Internet connection doesn't work that 

706
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:22,580
well or something like that,
you know?

707
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
So,
so it's really,

708
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:25,634
really useful to know that it's a,
the idea that your normal state is calm 

709
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,100
and well regulated is highly debatable.
It's highly debatable.

710
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:37,484
I would say there was very limited pre 
conditions under which you are going to 

711
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,244
feel safe.
And then I would also say you're highly 

712
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,074
motivated to maintain those conditions 
and you're also highly motivated not to 

713
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:53,190
go somewhere where those conditions 
don't apply.

714
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,013
Right?
You're just not going to do it because 

715
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,830
that's a different kind of place.

716
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,920
And I would say that place is chaos.
The place where the rules do not apply,

717
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,873
that's chaos.
And it's a real place that's unexplored 

718
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:13,401
territory and peep you have,
you're hardwired at an instinctual level

719
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,970
to deal with unexpected exposure to 
unexplored territory.

720
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,230
And you do that by going like this.
It's a startle and fear.

721
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,470
You're frozen.
And the reason for that is you're a prey

722
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:26,304
animal and you have sub circuits in you 
that are millions of years old that are 

723
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:37,011
there to protect you from becoming prey.
And that could be prey of other people,

724
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,393
that's for sure.
But it could be prey of anything that 

725
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,540
would like to meet you.
You know,

726
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,010
and part of the reason you might 
understand is that it's not,

727
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,200
there aren't that many large predators 
around anymore.

728
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,053
You know,
what's part of the human despoil nation 

729
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,003
of the planet is that mostly people 
don't like having their children eaten 

730
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,300
by tigers,
you know?

731
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,240
So,
and it's,

732
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:00,180
it's not because there's something wrong
with us,

733
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:02,880
it's because that's actually a rather 
unpleasant experience.

734
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,820
And so if you could have a tiger around 
or not have one,

735
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,640
you might well choose not to have one,
especially if you have some,

736
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,190
you know,
certain amount of love for your children

737
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,233
who,
although lovable also happened to be 

738
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,090
delicious.
Right?

739
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,770
So,
well,

740
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,993
okay,
so it's a proposition I want to 

741
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:24,030
undermine because I want to start with 
the presupposition that fundamentally as

742
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:24,864
a biological creature,
you're like a wild animal and you're 

743
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:27,020
like,
uh,

744
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,750
uh,
uh,

745
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,583
a prey animal,
things might happen to you and you're 

746
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,060
ready for them.
And then what we do with societies,

747
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:35,870
we construct up an edifice that has 
multilevel,

748
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,190
some of it's actually instantiated,
right?

749
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,473
And the rest of it is cultural and 
ritual and behavioral so that you don't 

750
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:43,734
have to be a prey animal.
You can be relatively calm and assured 

751
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:52,230
that nothing terrible is going to happen
to you in the next 10 seconds and that's

752
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,450
worth fighting for.
So,

753
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,990
alright,
that's probably good enough.

754
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,063
So now we've got,
we've got some basic presuppositions 

755
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:02,790
lead down,
you know,

756
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,120
and so let me just review them briefly.
One minute.

757
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Stability is not your normal state.
It's an abnormal state and it's very,

758
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:15,450
very difficult to maintain.

759
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,943
Okay.

760
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,630
You maintain it at least in large part 
as a consequence of being inculturated.

761
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,170
And to be enculturated means to adopt a 
value system that works for you,

762
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,340
but that also works for everyone else.
It has to fulfill those criteria.

763
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,443
Furthermore should be the kind of value 
system that allows you to move up 

764
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,610
dominance hierarchies if you can manage 
it.

765
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,770
A lot of constraints on your value 
system.

766
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,173
If your value system is producing the 
kind of behaviors that fulfill those 

767
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,020
criteria,
you don't have to be terrified.

768
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,730
Now,
it's not just terror.

769
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,564
Cause I've also learned that a lot of 
what culture is controlling is 

770
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:55,774
discussed.
Now it's actually not in the book 

771
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,100
because I just learned that.
So,

772
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:02,350
and I want to talk more about,
I want to talk to you more about disgust

773
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:03,184
because we've learned for example,
that people who are orderly 

774
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,353
temperamentally,
which is an element of 

775
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,930
conscientiousness,
are very sensitive to discussed.

776
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,820
And I think part of the issue is that it
isn't only that things can eat us,

777
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,460
it's the things can infect us.

778
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,893
And so we're just as prone a Priori to 
repel anything that's disgusting as we 

779
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:31,030
are prepared a priority to keep at bay.
Anything that's frightening.

780
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,610
Um,
one of the things I learned,

781
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,000
which was terrifying to me,
I read Hitler's table talk,

782
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:37,834
which was a collection of his 
spontaneous dinner speeches that were 

783
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:43,120
taken down by a secretary.
It's a very interesting book.

784
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,313
But one of the things I realized once we
kind of made the disgust orderliness 

785
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:50,740
connection in my lab about two years 
ago,

786
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,160
after looking for the biological basis 
of conscientiousness forever,

787
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,373
Hitler basically used a bodily metaphor 
to under pin his entire political 

788
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,484
philosophy.
So for Hitler who was hyper orderly 

789
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,304
bordering on obsession,
all he bathed four times a day for 

790
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,360
example,
and he was a vegetarian,

791
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,490
which actually is relevant,
um,

792
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,560
because he didn't want animals to be 
hurt,

793
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,423
you know,
he was sensitive to discussed and that 

794
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:18,940
was part of what underlying is 
vegetarianism.

795
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,190
Um,
he construed the area in race as a body.

796
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,830
Like that was his metaphor.
It's a body,

797
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,190
it's a pure body,
has pure blood.

798
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:32,380
So there's purity ideas that,
that,

799
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,453
you know,
made part of what he was saying 

800
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,314
motivationally significant.
And it was under assault from parasites 

801
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,923
and the parasites were,
well for him it was anyone who wasn't 

802
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,060
part of that body.
So it was discussed,

803
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,250
gone mad.
It was really was,

804
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,084
you know,
and so that forced me to modify my 

805
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,900
theories,
the theories I'm going to present to you

806
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:57,880
because for me a lot of what society did
was control anxiety,

807
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,063
you know,
in hunger and a lot of other things 

808
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,903
obviously.
But I didn't realize to what degree 

809
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,320
society also controlled,
discussed and how powerful disgust is as

810
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:09,154
a political motivator.
So there was a paper published in Kloss 

811
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:13,330
one about three months ago,
five months ago,

812
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,590
maybe more than that now.

813
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,263
It showed that the correlation between 
totalitarian beliefs in any given 

814
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:25,621
geographical locale and the prevalence 
of infectious disease was about 0.7

815
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,880
and that was true not only across 
countries but within countries.

816
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:31,714
If you divided the places up by how 
there were to be infectious diseases in 

817
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,250
the relevant states,
0.7

818
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,310
so prejudice,
xenophobia,

819
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,383
fear of foreigners,
all of that huge chunk of that is 

820
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,900
discussed.
Sensitivity Gone Mad.

821
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,130
So anyway,
so we're going to talk about that too as

822
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:54,800
a part of a control mechanism.
Yup.

823
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,130
What's that?
Applause.

824
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:02,630
One P l o s one one.
It's a public journal.

825
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:04,890
You can find it.
Look up infectious disease.

826
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:09,140
And a totalitarianism.
Here's a lot of work done on that.

827
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:09,974
Now.
