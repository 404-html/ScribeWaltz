1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,280
So
you were to have read today.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,390
This section on classification is just a
small section,

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,490
right on categorization.
And then the next section on boss,

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,324
basically on the new buddy Alicia,
the rest of the taping and the creation 

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:18,900
myth.
Okay.

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,734
Now that's the most fun.
That's the most archaic up creation 

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,064
guest that we have in written form in 
anything approaching a state of 

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,234
completeness.
So it's interesting from a historical 

9
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,300
perspective,
um,

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,383
because it's so archaic.
It's also an like the Mesopotamians has 

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,490
an extraordinarily well developed dogma,
Religious Dogma as far as I've been able

12
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,491
to be terrible in some ways.
Well I think in,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,633
in many ways Jewish and Christian 
theology are elaborations on a mess of 

14
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,574
attaining to think they'll eliod.
It points out the Mesopotamian creation 

15
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,494
myth,
although it's about 5,000 years old and 

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,130
seq stamp form is definitely based on 
oral traditions that are much older than

17
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:05,880
that.
So it's not,

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,713
it's not like you can say that the 
Sumerians just originated the Enuma 

19
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,450
elish in a,
in a very brief period of time on ground

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,930
that haven't been prepared.
They just codify,

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,293
uh,
traditions that have been handed down 

22
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,890
orally to that date and so we haven't 
been written for it.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
Now.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,613
The first thing I wanted to tell you 
about was this notion of categorization 

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,160
and I think,
I think this is

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,870
Roger Brown pointed out with 20 years 
ago or there about that time.

27
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,023
We have always in psychology tended to 
think that the way that people think is 

28
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,984
the way that scientists think and the 
way that we categorize things is in 

29
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:50,514
terms of the categories that we think 
are appropriate from the scientific or 

30
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:53,814
the logical perspective.
Brown points out that this is well that 

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,270
is a minimal amount of investigation 
basically in the cycle.

32
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,104
Linguistic domain immediately indicated 
that this was in fact false and that we 

33
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:08,590
do not categorize things naturally the 
way that people do scientifically.

34
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,803
In other words,
we don't use the notion of the proper 

35
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,680
set and he uses as a standard example of
the proper set,

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,880
the idea of triangles and you can tell 
what a triangle is.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,070
Absolutely.
You can define what's a triangle,

38
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:20,904
what isn't.
There's no fuzziness about the borders 

39
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,304
and everything either fits in the set or
is outside of the set and by contrast 

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,910
are natural categories don't seem to be 
of that type.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,940
They have fuzzy boundaries and they're 
more concerned with function,

42
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,400
so to speak,
or with an effect of relevance than with

43
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,401
sensory and with swift.
Absolutely determinable sensory essence.

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
So we categorize in in much more vague 
manner.

45
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,020
And it seems to me that I gave you the 
listing in this,

46
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:49,854
in this document of the qualities of 
natural categorization as they'd been 

47
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,284
described by George Lakoff in his book,
a women fire and dangerous things and 

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,150
lack off is basically following up on a 
tradition as I'm not a psycho linguist,

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,830
and this is no new news to me basically.
But lakoff has been falling apart.

50
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,640
Church tradition that was established by
Roger Brown and Eleanor Ross,

51
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,474
who was one of his students and the 
older elder has made a big name for 

52
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,260
herself studying categorization.

53
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,410
The thing I think is so interesting 
about this is that what Rosch and lakoff

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,813
describe as categories are very,
very much like the kinds of categories 

55
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
that religious thinkers have used that 
have been studied from a completely 

56
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,500
different perspective by people like 
[inaudible] and Mircea Eliade.

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,883
So it's not that surprising if you think
about it because it's obvious that 

58
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,214
religious categories aren't proper sets,
their natural categories are can't 

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,050
people in religious categories.
And I've always thought that way.

60
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,160
So it's not like it's,
it's not that surprising.

61
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,323
What's surprising our guests more 
surprising is that the overlap between 

62
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,970
the two literatures is,
is not well explored or,

63
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,280
no.
So,

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,970
uh,
the first thing we should do,

65
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,910
I guess is think to think about this 
notion of categorization.

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,151
Yeah.
Okay.

67
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:17,200
Lakoff describes natural categories is 
cognitive models.

68
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,034
So the first thing he says is that they 
are embodied with regards to their 

69
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,190
content,
which essentially means that they can be

70
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,024
used without necessarily being defined.
It means that they are implicit in 

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,850
action without necessarily being 
implicit and description.

72
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,223
So basically what lakoff is pointing out
is that if you act towards a number of 

73
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:37,154
different things,
as if they are the same thing with 

74
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,620
regards to your actions,
then you are in fact,

75
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,893
uh,
you are in fact treating those objects 

76
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:46,724
as if they're in the same category.
Because one domain of category can be 

77
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,150
fucked,
like significance for motor output.

78
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,590
And that's,
you think,

79
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,424
if you think about,
it's like what defines chair because 

80
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:02,480
chair's very and all sorts of ways,
they vary so much that there's very,

81
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,830
there may be very little sensory overlap
between one chair and another if there's

82
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,664
not much.
There's not much similar between a 

83
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,460
stump,
for example.

84
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,250
And the kind of designer chair that you 
might see in a museum,

85
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,263
they're very different objects.
But the thing they have in common is 

86
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:16,634
their implication for output,
which is the chairs are things that you 

87
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,810
can sit on,
right?

88
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,773
They're defined by their,
by their significance in our under 

89
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,900
sensory nature.
So I used an example here.

90
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,510
What makes a dog you?
You might say,

91
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,250
I can't say but I know one when I see 
one,

92
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:34,220
which is another indication that you'd 
be using a natural category,

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,913
the August something friendly,
something to be petted and something to 

94
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,404
play with.
Although such knowledge does not 

95
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,770
comprise everything that makes up you 
regard his dog.

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,870
The thing that's interesting about those
ideas,

97
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,093
something friendly,
something to be petted and something to 

98
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:52,520
play with is that in a sense those are 
not precisely the attributes of the dog.

99
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,500
I think of a natural category of dog 
because what you're,

100
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,240
if you define a dog as a friend or as 
something to play with,

101
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,074
you're actually defining the object in 
terms of your interactions with it and 

102
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,974
not in terms of the object and a lot of 
the terms we use have exactly that 

103
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,350
nature.
Like beautiful.

104
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,660
For example,
it says when you define it,

105
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,610
say if you to find another person that's
beautiful.

106
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,620
It's very difficult to tell exactly 
where it is that that quality besides,

107
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,600
I mean people say beauty's in the eye of
the beholder.

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,470
We know there's quite a substantial 
amount of cultural variation in terms of

109
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,304
attitudes towards beauty.
So it's very difficult to pin down what 

110
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,070
constitutes beauty from the objective 
perspective.

111
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:30,904
I mean there's been a certain certain 
attempts to do that and they've been 

112
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,184
somewhat successful.
But the point is is that as beauty's in 

113
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:38,924
the eye of the beholder,
but it's something that we naturally 

114
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,024
attribute to an object.
So a lot of the things that we consider 

115
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:43,934
properties of objects are actually what 
lakoff describes his interaction with 

116
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,954
properties.
There are things that we attribute to 

117
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,024
the thing that actually arise as a 
consequence of our interaction with the 

118
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,640
thing.
So like the notion of friend,

119
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,330
when you,
when you describe,

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,940
if you put someone in the category of 
friend,

121
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,774
you're actually describing them in terms
of your pattern of interactions with 

122
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,014
them.
Although you attributed the qualities 

123
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,520
that make up those interactions to them 
and you do that automatically.

124
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,863
And what I'm suggesting with,
with regards to this study of 

125
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:16,490
categorization is that we do that.
That is the natural way that we think is

126
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,324
we think about things in terms of their 
implication for our behavioral output 

127
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,343
and we need to do that because that's 
what adaptation means and say a few of 

128
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,540
adapt adapted to something.
You've structured your behavior well.

129
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,374
Basically what you've done is structure 
your behavior in the presence of that 

130
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,880
thing so that it does what you want it 
to do,

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,743
which means basically that it doesn't 
threaten you then it doesn't hurt you 

132
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,223
that it furthers your progress towards 
the goal or that it caused the 

133
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,790
tombstone,
that goal itself.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,760
That's behavioral adaptation and

135
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,303
well

136
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,680
those things,
the things that make up that category of

137
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,543
objects to which you've structured 
behavioral adaptation that's explored 

138
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,624
territory.
How's the domain of the known say in 

139
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,720
that domain is everything that you 
understand how to act towards.

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,640
Now what I'm trying to suggest in the 
course of this whole manuscript,

141
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,474
because that's how your brain works,
the scientific overlay of scientific 

142
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,484
categorizations is just a thin veneer on
top of that and in some sense it's 

143
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,423
irrelevant.
The near from the perspective of 

144
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,364
emotional regulation.
Science has enabled us to describe 

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,664
things ever more accurate so that we can
keep track of them are still what we're 

146
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,210
interested in is determining how to 
behave in the presence of things.

147
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,700
That's what we want to know.
Okay.

148
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,953
Now lack off points on a few other 
things about natural categories and I 

149
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:34,964
want you to think about this in regards 
to the sorts of categories that we're 

150
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,020
going to talk about for the remainder.

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,853
Of course he says they're characterized 
by basic level categorization and basic 

152
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:43,784
level primacy and basically what he 
means by that is that we tend to view 

153
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:52,451
things as in a category or as objects to
themselves if they're the right size for

154
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,500
us.
In other words,

155
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,320
that the world that we perceive,
which is the world of experience,

156
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,270
which is in some sense doing world you 
can get access to is human sized.

157
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,363
The cat.
There are categories that naturally 

158
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,860
spring to mind because they're handy.
That's a good way of thinking about,

159
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,510
it's like the English imperial system of
measurement.

160
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,003
We can we define things in terms of 
being English imperial system and it's 

161
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,124
very handy.
Literally a foot is a foot long and 

162
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,883
inches.
The length of one digit in the point 

163
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:24,714
lakoff is trying to make is that the 
world would have experienced presents 

164
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,284
itself the way it presents itself 
because of the interaction between our 

165
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,010
physiology and whatever it is.

166
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,893
That's how we there and one of the 
things that we're going to try to 

167
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:41,601
explore is what does it mean to say 
whatever it is that that's out there.

168
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:44,910
I mean we tend to think of it 
scientifically as the objective world,

169
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,983
which would be exactly the same as it is
now if none of us were here except that 

170
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,334
none of us would be here.
The point lakoff is trying to make is 

171
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,424
that what we define as reality is 
somewhat more or what were you 

172
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,660
experiences?
Reality is more complex than that.

173
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,494
It's an interaction between whatever it 
is that's out there and ask and 

174
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,964
everything that we think of is real.
We defined like in terms of our 

175
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,580
experience of temporal duration and size
and weight.

176
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,873
Okay.

177
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,023
I guess the only way,
the only way you can get your mind 

178
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,840
around this to some degree is to try to 
think of

179
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,203
what lakoff is saying in a sense is that
the fact that we're human and have the 

180
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,150
characteristics that we have,
which are basically our limitations,

181
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,313
means that the universe is constituted 
in a particular way with regards to us 

182
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:34,350
is that we have a built in level of 
analysis.

183
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,603
It's obviously not the sub atomic level 
or at the molecular level and it's not 

184
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,280
the cosmic level either.
It's human sized.

185
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,803
Now if you start thinking about what 
would constitute reality in the absence 

186
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,254
of a human observer,
the first problem that you run into is 

187
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,661
the problem of a reference point is you 
no longer have anything against which to

188
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,654
judge things like duration or size and 
certainly not things like certainly not 

189
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:02,120
things like color or beauty or emotional
significance.

190
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,290
Don't those categories obviously 
disappear.

191
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,483
What happens to the sensory categories 
is not all that easy to figure out 

192
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,484
either.

193
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,320
I can't,
I already can't figure it out.

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Would you find that in his book,
the Character Physical Mall discusses

195
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,400
encoding the nature of human experience 
in a mathematical form and sending it to

196
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,123
an alien so that he could reconstruct 
the world that we experience based on 

197
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,933
the
proportion of an elemental character or 

198
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,700
an element
or something like that.

199
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,810
And he gives a fairly good,
uh,

200
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,223
just from that,
it's convincing that you could describe 

201
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,490
the world independent of human 
experience.

202
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,020
If you define,
if you define the,

203
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,543
that,
that,

204
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,750
that make up our capacity to experience 
is that if you eat,

205
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,623
if you can just,
you could possibly describe the world 

206
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:08,221
that we exceed the world in terms of 
something which is transhumance by,

207
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,290
by,
by using mathematical symbols.

208
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,050
Well that's interesting.
So feynman says he,

209
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,043
he would define our level of analysis 
mathematically as well as what it is 

210
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,074
that we're experiencing.
And that would give an alien the 

211
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,610
capacity to see what it is that we see.
He wasn't,

212
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,444
he wasn't talking about,
he was talking about a trans human 

213
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,883
reality.
Fiman does mischief subject the reality 

214
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,860
of reality to the presence of the 
subject?

215
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,120
Right,
right.

216
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,700
Well anyway,
I got to,

217
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:43,660
the subject must have some sort of 
intelligence that is,

218
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,543
it leaves me in some way where like our 
own in order to interpret what we send 

219
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:48,670
out there.

220
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,503
So just really not [inaudible]
so there's an alien out there who has a 

221
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,330
similar enough intelligence to ours that
can,

222
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,080
that can understand this thing that 
we've sent out.

223
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,240
I mean then then they're the subject in 
question.

224
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,050
It opens up the,
it draws question too.

225
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,840
I mean it,
it sort of puts a question mark over the

226
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,674
possibility of seeing that reality is 
dependent on that [inaudible] it's 

227
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,470
ridiculous talking about reality in the 
absence of the human subject.

228
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,061
Well,
trans human,

229
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,170
yes,
but trans subject,

230
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:22,570
no.
Okay.

231
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,620
One small difference between,
okay,

232
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,690
well I don't want to make too much of 
this because it isn't,

233
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,920
it's knowing something that's critical 
to the arguments that,

234
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,620
that we're going to,
we're going to undertake.

235
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,454
One of the things I want to tell you 
about is how mythological categories 

236
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,560
represent the category of all things 
that exist in the absence of a subject,

237
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,250
but just kind of a strange category and 
even the mythological,

238
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:49,084
like in the scientific world,
we presume an objective independent 

239
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:51,460
reality.

240
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,293
I don't want to argue,
I certainly don't want to argue about 

241
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,020
that because it's way too complicated an
issue,

242
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,243
but may have also presumes that 
something exists in the absence of a 

243
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,260
procedure or in the absence of a 
subject.

244
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,094
Although the thing that exists is very 
difficult to define and that's one of 

245
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,940
the things we're going to take a brief 
look at today because my,

246
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:09,774
my question is what does,
what does science have to do it and all 

247
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,560
of that science,
another size is size of the,

248
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,160
of the,
uh,

249
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,990
of the raptors point that which presents
us up to the reference.

250
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,953
Well,
all the lack office basically saying is 

251
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:23,524
that certain categories seem to present 
themselves to us more naturally than 

252
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,260
others.
Like the category cat presents itself to

253
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:33,490
us more naturally than the category of 
species of cat because we naturally,

254
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,130
we're naturally predisposed,
so to speak,

255
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:38,770
towards making an object out of.

256
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,783
I was something like at cap now,
no one knows exactly why it is that 

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,220
certain forms of categorization appeared
to us more nationally than other sorts.

258
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,950
I suspect it has something to do with 
what you can say.

259
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,630
I have something to do with our 
biological hard wiring,

260
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,464
which is not really much of an answer.
It's just the way and we are and we 

261
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,500
perceive certain things more accurately 
than we perceive other things.

262
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,330
I mean,
just to take a trivial example in,

263
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,270
in this room will focus all of our 
attention on each other's face.

264
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,760
It's like I'm not going to spend a lot 
of time when I'm talking to you,

265
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:11,594
looking at your hands.
My natural point of orientation in our 

266
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,730
discussion is your face.
It's very significant for me,

267
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,360
and I think you see this sort of thing.
If you look at children's drawings,

268
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,490
I mean she's a child's drawing of a 
person's,

269
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,530
you know,
usually something like this.

270
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,983
Maybe there's not even a body,
but the head is 90% of the person and 

271
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,530
the face is 90% of the head.
And that's,

272
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,940
I think this is a protocol linguistic 
representation of me of a human being.

273
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,610
Children tend to produce these sorts of 
figures spontaneously.

274
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,893
I would say that's kind of a natural 
hero glyphic that stands for person and 

275
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,783
the things that are most relevant about 
the person or the things that are 

276
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:49,934
focused in on by the child.
It's just certain things appear to us 

277
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:53,924
more naturally than other things and 
those things more naturally constitute 

278
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:57,734
our world.

279
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,270
So
talking about sides really quickly,

280
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,633
you returned to physics stuff and what's
intuitive that you can sort of look at 

281
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,830
the,
you can sort of divide the universe into

282
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,600
three very basic levels of order to 
magnitude.

283
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,493
You can have sort of what's intuitive.
There's the Newtonian universe we all 

284
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,653
live in and you can have the cosmic 
aware of which is sort of defined by 

285
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,190
signing mechanics and space time.
And you can go to quantum mechanics,

286
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,430
which is smaller than you could possibly
perceive.

287
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,603
And if you,
if you look at the mathematics involved 

288
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,260
in each one,
the Newtonian equations,

289
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,103
the ones that make sense to you that you
think in and the other ones seemed like 

290
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:35,700
when you read about in the first time 
you think to yourself,

291
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,470
how could this be?
But in a,

292
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:38,910
in a sort of mathematical sense,
they're all,

293
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,740
that's an excellent one because the 
nature,

294
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,603
that's an excellent example because the 
Newtonian universe is intuitive and the 

295
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:46,534
reason that it's intuitive from the loch
coffee perspective is that the laws are 

296
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:52,810
in accordance with our motor patterns 
are patterns of adaptation.

297
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,913
I mean Psja is pointed out that we first
adapt to objects from the motor 

298
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,500
perspective as a consequence of 
exploration.

299
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,334
Then we build our abstract notions about
our relationships with those objects as 

300
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:05,930
a consequence of our established motor 
patterns.

301
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:10,240
So that basically that basically sums up
the notion of embodied knowledge.

302
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,000
And your point is that these other 
universes are counter intuitive.

303
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,063
They,
they're not in accordance with our 

304
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:16,564
experience.
Well that's partly because they aren't 

305
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,503
the,
they aren't the left the levels of 

306
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,604
resolution or the orders of magnitude 
towards which we actually adapt our 

307
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,114
behavior.

308
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,620
So yeah.

309
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,720
Okay.
Anyways,

310
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,490
you can finish reading through the,
uh,

311
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,530
the properties of natural categories.
They have interest in categories.

312
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,270
I also think that,
well,

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,250
membership and sensuality gradients is 
kind of an interesting category,

314
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,940
uh,
as this familial resemblance.

315
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,550
The idea of familial resemblance is 
quite interesting.

316
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,273
Basically what this is,
Raj has been coaching under the thing 

317
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,724
that she's worked on.
Say if we have notions of prototypes 

318
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,794
where our categories is that there's a 
kind of an ideal thing that constitutes 

319
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,710
the category,
the category bird people wouldn't say,

320
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,290
for example,
that robin is a more prototypical burden

321
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:11,520
than an ostrich and you can't exactly,
do you have a question?

322
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,533
Yeah.

323
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,130
Maybe it's not really a way to what 
you're saying,

324
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,973
right.
But do we sort of subconsciously 

325
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,350
concrete different categories or find 
things easier in a categorized?

326
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,870
And what we see,
I mean now we'd all look at each other's

327
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,180
faces,
but if you have dreams,

328
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,014
you can sort of identify somebody.
Even if they look completely 

329
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:30,840
differently,
you can say,

330
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,430
you know,
and I knew in my dream this was supposed

331
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:33,264
to be your father.
Even though he looked like my math 

332
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,550
teacher,
they maybe are we sharing of getting out

333
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,720
of different subconscious of essence of 
people?

334
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,554
Then when we

335
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,710
in in a dream or I don't know.
I don't know.

336
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,340
I know what you're saying and people.
Yeah.

337
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,850
I mean there must be some other 
category,

338
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,420
some other way of categorizing.
Yeah.

339
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,570
I guess what happens in,
in,

340
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:53,404
in a situation and dream like that is 
that you have to conflict in 

341
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,560
categorizations of one takes 
predominance.

342
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,300
So you say,
despite all these exceptions,

343
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,520
the product,
typical aspects of this,

344
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,830
whatever it is,
are still intact.

345
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,053
So we're not,
you'd have to look at the individual 

346
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,990
differences in the dreams to be able to 
do your own exactly.

347
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,100
Exactly how that happens.
But this is the prototypical Smith brunt

348
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:14,730
of this is,
you know,

349
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,563
your classic example.
How do you identify some family members 

350
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:23,640
is coming from all from the same family.
You have all these Smith brothers,

351
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,290
there's five of them,
and you can all tell their brothers,

352
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,124
but they don't share the same complete 
set of characteristics is the 

353
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,450
prototypical brother.

354
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,120
Maybe he has six characteristics.
So you might say,

355
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:36,954
well a big nose would be one and the 
heavy mustache would be another kind of 

356
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,003
beard would be a third big years and be 
a fourth and heavy eyebrows from vfm in 

357
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:48,090
glasses say would be a six.
So that's your prototype people,

358
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:48,924
Smith's brother.
But to be recognizable as a smith 

359
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,743
brother,
perhaps you only have to have two of 

360
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,170
these characteristics and the rest can 
vary.

361
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,200
So this character would have big ears 
and eyes and maybe the mustache,

362
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,750
but he didn't have a little nose and no 
beard.

363
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,420
And then this character would have the 
glasses and a big nose and mustache.

364
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,880
A little areas I,
I'll say a beard anyways,

365
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,870
you get the idea and they don't share.
They're not like triangles.

366
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:19,470
You can't precisely define the captain 
characteristics that this myth,

367
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,363
Brett Smith brothers half,
theoretically the old rate to this 

368
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,124
relate to this central prototype which 
we abstract from our experience in some 

369
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,480
complex manner.

370
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,990
So the notion of
what else is interesting.

371
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,683
Well the other thing about natural 
categories is that instead of being 

372
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,750
distinct,
like,

373
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,940
like a proper sets as make it overlap.
And this is part of the reason that,

374
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,140
well knowing this helps you make sense 
of it,

375
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,490
the logical categories because they 
shift with context.

376
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,830
Unfortunately that makes them difficult 
to interpret.

377
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:54,664
For example,
one of the most basic divisions of the 

378
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,210
world from a mythological perspective as
masculine versus feminine.

379
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,513
And that's related in a very profound 
way to explore a territory versus saw 

380
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,110
unexplored territory.
Um,

381
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,850
the problem is is that whether or not 
something is masculine or feminine tends

382
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,910
to depend on the context of 
interpretation.

383
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,953
So for example,
if you talk about an island and the 

384
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,640
ocean,
then the island is masculine and notions

385
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,474
feminine.
But if you talk about an island in the 

386
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,334
sky,
then the island is feminine and the sky 

387
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,090
is masked.

388
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,923
But so we,
even though the island is theoretically 

389
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,900
objectively the same in both 
circumstances,

390
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,690
it's cloud.
It's an effect of classification,

391
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:36,910
shifts with context.
Now you might think,

392
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,800
well that's a bizarre property for a 
categorization have.

393
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,003
The thing is we do this all the time.
This is actually how we derive meaning 

394
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,940
in large part.
It's always context dependent.

395
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,153
Like most of the words you know,
you don't know because someone told you 

396
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:49,984
the meaning of them.
You know because you derive the meaning 

397
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,910
from the context.
You see a normal word,

398
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,753
one context,
and then in another context and then in 

399
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:57,694
another context and you can derive the 
meaning from from from analysis of 

400
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,063
what's common across the context.
Maybe you can define it novel where if 

401
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,284
you saw it in 10 different sentences,
you have enough information there to 

402
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:11,464
figure out what the word means and the 
meaning of the word shifts with the 

403
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:15,364
sentence.
In this meaning of the sentence shifts 

404
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,200
with the paragraph and the meaning of 
the paragraph shifts with the essay.

405
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,363
That's why you can pull things out of 
context and reversed their meaning 

406
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:26,560
often.
So the fact of context dependent meaning

407
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:27,820
has gone up that much of a mystery

408
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,680
cause everything happened.
I'm a little confused

409
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,610
when you see a door or something.
Okay.

410
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,250
Now someone can say that they see a door
and it has,

411
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,493
you know,
they,

412
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,390
it has sensory,
you know,

413
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,353
information like it's a door you open 
and close it but they feel nothing 

414
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,170
towards it.
Right.

415
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,750
But does it have value?

416
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,010
Well it's only,
it's always last week for example,

417
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,540
we talked about the relationship of 
things to your story.

418
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,360
You have your story
and um,

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,630
like if part of your ideal future

420
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,730
doesn't have it doesn't have any 
relevance unless it interferes.

421
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,900
No,
no,

422
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,220
not only interferes with if it aids.
Do you think,

423
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,530
what,
look again,

424
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,433
whatever it looks to me like your cortex
evolved in part to modulate the 

425
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:20,054
automatic reactions of your limbic 
system to stimuli to make it more 

426
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,790
flexible.
How it looks to me like what's happening

427
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,900
is that what your cortex has done is 
high jack,

428
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:30,800
your limbic system.
In this way it says you can put anything

429
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:34,790
you want into the goal box,
but as soon as you put it there,

430
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,010
it's a conservatory reward.
It doesn't matter what it is.

431
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,280
Now you have a lot of underlying 
biological systems,

432
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,800
but how has their own idea about what 
should be here,

433
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,990
but you can still put whatever you want 
in there.

434
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,350
It's a conservatory reward now.
As soon as you do that,

435
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,210
everything that you encounter is 
construed in relationship to that goal.

436
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,193
So the door is only relevant if you need
to get through it to get to where you 

437
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:57,614
want to go.
Right now it's not relevant at the end 

438
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,404
of the class.
It will.

439
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,970
Absolutely,
and you shift the significance of things

440
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,300
by shifting your framework of reference 
and what we're trying to define this.

441
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,460
What constitutes a framework of 
reference.

442
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,190
That's one thing.
What is a framework of reference?

443
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,770
I would say in terms of natural 
categories,

444
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,723
everything within here is of one type of
thing and everything outside of it is 

445
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,503
I'm a completely different type of thing
and I tried to define that as the known 

446
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,133
and unknown.

447
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,360
Or You could say as,
and I really think this is,

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,070
I've been trying to chase

449
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,103
say categories have this central 
prototype and there's all sorts of 

450
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,090
mythological categories.
Masculine,

451
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:43,890
this one category and feminine is 
another,

452
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,203
a sky as a category and earth is it a 
category matter as a category and water 

453
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:52,140
as a category because things overlap in 
some odd way,

454
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,360
like sky tends to be related to 
masculine.

455
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,710
For example,
I've been trying to chase down what's at

456
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,770
the core of these mythological 
categories and that's why I come up with

457
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,930
these terms.
No woman unknown.

458
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,660
And then there's the process of 
mediation that's the knower.

459
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,050
Or You could say,
and maybe this is even more fundamental,

460
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,260
the unknown.
It's unexplored territory.

461
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,483
The no one has explored territory
and the knower is the explorer and 

462
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,980
that's how we conceive of the world.
The world is made up.

463
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,480
Yes,
yes.

464
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,490
And this,
that's it.

465
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,760
That's how our brain naturally organizes
things.

466
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,610
How come?
Um,

467
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,483
I was a little confused.
How come that the heavens or the sky is 

468
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:41,504
considered masculine and cans?
We would think known territory because 

469
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,870
compared to the earth it seems like it's
more unknown.

470
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,420
Good question.
Good question.

471
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,103
Okay,

472
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,610
well have to think about that part of 
the answer.

473
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,613
There's two masculine categories and 
that's part of the answer is the 

474
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,710
explored territory tends to be the king.
Do you think the old king Michael Cirrus

475
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,153
or example,
where does the knower tends to be 

476
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,254
masculine as well as usually the sun,
that's horace say or Marduk and these 

477
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:26,180
are usually skype bonds.
They're assimilated to the sun,

478
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,930
the sun as assimilated to consciousness.
So that's basically the answer to that.

479
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,870
The sky is the domain of the sun.
The Sun is massive.

480
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,520
Why is the Sun Masculine?
Well,

481
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,110
because it's associated with 
consciousness,

482
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,430
illumination,
enlightenment,

483
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,460
it rate it rules during the times when 
we are conscious.

484
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,150
It's also the thing that fights the 
dragon of chaos in the night packs.

485
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:47,520
It's way out in the belly of the beast 
and then is born again

486
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,960
in the morning.
So that's,

487
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,750
that's the answer,
that question.

488
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,840
I could think of a way,
but the sky could be explored.

489
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:55,674
Territory relative theory,
people who never thought of going up in 

490
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,184
this guy,
this guy is not something you move 

491
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,780
through,
but something it's over you.

492
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,540
And to that extent it is exploring.
It's very predictable.

493
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,980
And even if you move a great distance 
across Europe,

494
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,790
this guys is relatively the same.
Where's your changes?

495
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,743
Inadequate,

496
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,540
right?
Yeah.

497
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,640
That,
that can be as well.

498
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,320
It's also the case,
you have to remember,

499
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,800
and this is one of the things that makes
analysis of mythological symbols tricky.

500
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,280
They do shift with context and they're 
not always culturally stable.

501
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,443
For the Sumerians,
this guy who was male and the earth was 

502
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,360
female,
but for the Egyptians,

503
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:29,100
the sky was female and the earth was 
male.

504
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,080
That's more rare,
but it does happen.

505
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,580
What seems to be,
well,

506
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:33,414
so you have to look at,
you have to look for the prototype 

507
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:37,500
that's at the core of this to try and 
make sense of it.

508
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:38,334
The shifting relationships.
So the mother earth notion is more 

509
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,410
common.
Laptop.

510
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,340
The fatherland is also a mythological 
notion,

511
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,830
right?
You fight for the fatherland,

512
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,673
we fight for the man.
Those two ideas have slightly different 

513
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,710
slants.
It seems like to call the explorer

514
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,560
predictable,
unexplored,

515
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:01,510
the unpredictable might be just as 
fundamental.

516
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,631
Yes,
yes.

517
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:04,440
Fair,
fair enough.

518
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,890
Fair enough.
That's another,

519
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,790
that's a perfectly reasonable way of 
looking at it as well.

520
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,520
And that's,
that's basically where you see the,

521
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,593
uh,
neuropsychological overlap instantly 

522
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:14,754
because we do know now that you're 
emotional systems are our a priori 

523
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,120
hardwired to respond to the 
unpredictable.

524
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,983
That's a domain.
Now it looks to me like in terms of 

525
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,753
neuro psychological function,
then the left hemisphere of the 

526
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:28,764
linguistic hemisphere,
it's specialized for habitual patterns 

527
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:31,884
of action.
It looks to me like it's the hemisphere 

528
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,170
that rules and known territory.
Okay.

529
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,831
You say,
well,

530
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:39,600
your brain is actually wired up so that 
it,

531
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,763
it has one set of responses that are 
useful when you know what the hell 

532
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:45,384
you're doing.
And then it has a whole other set of 

533
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,380
subsystems that are useful when you 
don't know what you're doing.

534
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,140
And when you do know what you're doing 
is the linguistic left.

535
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,983
That's it's you.
And when you don't know what you're 

536
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:55,884
doing,
it's the limbically dominated right 

537
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,680
hemisphere that then appears to mediate 
your actions.

538
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,260
Now why would I say that?
Oh,

539
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,380
it's part of it.
Because we know the right frontal cortex

540
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,180
responds to punishment and threat.
Trevor,

541
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,033
the APR already phenomenon that appear 
with the appearance of the 

542
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,424
unpredictable.
So the right hemisphere is what governs 

543
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,110
your behavioral responses.
When you encounter something you do that

544
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:19,260
you can predict in terms of it's more 
cognitive functions.

545
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,640
Well,
governance,

546
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,260
anxiety,
that's for sure.

547
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,450
It may govern pain.
That's not so clear,

548
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
but it looks like it's,
it looks like there's a high possibility

549
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,620
governs depression anyways.
Um,

550
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,533
it's also the part of your brain that's 
good at recognizing patterns and 

551
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:35,190
generating stories.
And my guess is that you can think about

552
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,024
this.
If you encounter something you don't 

553
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,214
understand,
the first thing you tried to do is to 

554
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,010
figure out how it's like other things 
you've already encountered,

555
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
which is basically to say that when 
you're first trying to adapt to 

556
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,990
something that you don't,
can't predict,

557
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,843
you try to apprehend in it familiar 
patterns say well even people who just 

558
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,560
with the sky then that's how we get the 
constellations had this massive,

559
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,110
an undiscovered territory that 
constitutes the night sky.

560
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,093
You chunk it into patterns and that 
makes it identifiable and you have 

561
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,514
stories that revolve around the patterns
and you start to move the information 

562
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,850
from the domain of the unknown into the 
domain of familiar territory.

563
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,903
And when you think about it,
the right hemisphere is the hemisphere 

564
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:17,290
that seems to be specialized for for 
stories and for fantasy.

565
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,280
And it is fantasy is hypothesis 
generation as far as I can tell,

566
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,114
a fantasy is the story of well maybe 
it's like this and your and your right 

567
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:26,794
hemisphere seems to be good for that.
So then you have a nice set of 

568
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:29,134
functions.
It's the thing that is activated when 

569
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,880
you encounter something unpredictable.
So it stops you,

570
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,773
it makes you shut up and look,
and then the next thing it does is just 

571
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,300
start thinking it's specialized for 
global pattern recognition.

572
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,180
Recognition wants to give you a quick 
and dirty answer.

573
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,310
What's out there?
Well now,

574
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,930
right hemisphere thinks,
well it's like this.

575
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,040
It's like this.
It's like this.

576
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,420
It's like this and it gives you a 
picture.

577
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:50,254
So you get something like,
I'm like Kelly who will encounter and a 

578
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:53,524
little bit later who's a,
who's a monster that inhabits the 

579
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,730
unknown.
That's basically composed of determinant

580
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,573
things that are frightening.
So like Kelly was the goddess of the 

581
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:07,420
unknown.
She has staring face big teeth,

582
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,880
she sits in fire,
she has eight legs like a spider.

583
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,630
She's a picture of the thing that lives 
the out there in the unknown.

584
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,180
Anyways.
Okay.

585
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,073
Back.
Can you elaborate on how the left 

586
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,890
rewards in the business as well?
It seems to be,

587
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,190
it seems to be more specialized for 
information that you already know how to

588
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,660
handle.
And it also,

589
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,530
it's also good at handling 
linguistically mediated information that

590
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:33,364
by the time you've chopped up the world 
into units that you can describe with 

591
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,020
words,
you've already done a pretty good job of

592
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:38,710
adapting to it.

593
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,210
You can even have straggly represented 
if,

594
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,153
if you're still,
I think action is a form of 

595
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:48,430
categorization.
If you really don't know something,

596
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,890
all you know about is the in its 
presence.

597
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:54,280
You should stop or run.
That's a form of categorization.

598
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,340
It's pretty generalized information,
right?

599
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,490
By the time you've explored something 
really thoroughly,

600
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,340
you can describe it and words and you 
can communicate it,

601
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,800
and that seems to me part of what the 
left hemisphere does,

602
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,930
but it's also responsible.
We think about it this way.

603
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,393
The left frontal hemisphere is also 
responsible for the generation of 

604
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,980
positive aspect.
Now,

605
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,863
you only generate positive ethic in the 
presence of cues of conservatory reward 

606
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,360
in the presence of incentive rewards.
Now,

607
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,233
incentive reward is something that 
indicates that you're getting closer to 

608
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,200
your goal.
Okay?

609
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,333
Now explored territory is basically full
of indications that you're getting 

610
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:32,164
closer to your goal.

611
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,000
That's why it's explored,
right?

612
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,953
Because you've already transformed it 
from something unknown and threatening 

613
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,330
into something that you can use to get 
to where you want to go.

614
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,720
And the left hemisphere does that.
So it looks to me like,

615
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,230
well it looks to me like those things 
all sort of fit together.

616
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,930
Adoptation basically means in its,
in its most optimal sense,

617
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,033
adaptation means that you transform 
something you do not understand into 

618
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,470
something that you can not only predict 
but can you,

619
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,930
because you just don't want to transform
everything into something irrelevant,

620
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,220
right.
That would be useless.

621
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,640
You want to transform things.
You don't understand the things that you

622
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:12,860
can do something with that you want to 
do.

623
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,463
So,
so at the individual has a different 

624
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:18,960
balance through which they approach like
the youth,

625
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:22,120
like the balance between the left and 
right hemisphere or the first two.

626
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,943
Well there's,
there's some evidence for variation and 

627
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:27,370
temperament.
You know,

628
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,160
some people are more inhibited and some 
people are less inhibited.

629
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,240
Now the problem with that is that I 
believe that,

630
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,074
I mean it does look like there's pretty 
solid evidence for these temperamental 

631
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:38,104
variations.
So you might say that you have a lower 

632
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,440
threshold,
for example,

633
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,250
for experiencing anxiety in the presence
of something or a new one,

634
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,800
then the next person does and that's to 
cross situation.

635
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,873
The problem with that is that it doesn't
take into account the fact that what's 

636
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,260
unexpected is always construed in 
relationship to the story,

637
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,790
but my guess is that if people looked 
into this,

638
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:58,624
they find it inhibited.
People have different stories about the 

639
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:02,434
way the world is constructed and part of
their biological predisposition towards 

640
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:06,844
timidity manifest itself in the 
structure of the stories they tell 

641
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:13,330
themselves about the world.
It makes sense because if you're more,

642
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,853
you're more frightened by people.
The stories you tell about them are 

643
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:20,520
going to be twisted more towards the 
domain of threat.

644
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,833
So those

645
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,210
does that balance also very 
situationally,

646
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,123
like you said,
if if someone is refusing groups up in 

647
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,523
all this information that does have 
relevance to their story and they're 

648
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:34,190
ignoring it until it gets to a certain 
point where they can foresee,

649
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,493
yeah,
I think there are a whole last half of 

650
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:40,420
the course is about that.
It's like because one of the things that

651
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:41,254
you can do to yourself to make yourself 
more pathological and just know how to 

652
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,633
adapt to normal,
his information and that makes you 

653
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:50,170
function with pathological.
I think

654
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,103
so.
Would that actually make the right 

655
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:54,080
hemisphere less reactive or we didn't 
make it yet?

656
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,680
It would make,
it would make a left,

657
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,233
I don't know.

658
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,000
Compensating function or is it,

659
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,553
I think it,
I think what happens in those 

660
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:03,564
circumstances does the right hemisphere 
starts to make a lot of noise so your 

661
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,314
dreams start to,
or one of the students I had last been 

662
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,493
open the in the class this past last 
year has just written a paper for me on 

663
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:17,470
the potential function of dreams.
He points out that in in neural map,

664
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,230
in neural net modeling of pattern 
recognition,

665
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,723
there's a phenomena called catastrophic 
failure where if you have a neuro debt 

666
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:27,264
and it's going to a bird category and a 
fish category and you'd throw in a 

667
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,594
penguin,
well what happens is that the bird 

668
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,820
county going to fish category collapsed 
and all you get is animal category.

669
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,923
So there's kinds anomalous information 
that will blow a whole categorization 

670
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:40,824
systems.
So what he paused it was that there's 

671
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,374
one system that has,
that does categorization and another 

672
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:50,640
that's slowly feeds at anomalous 
information so it doesn't collapse.

673
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,000
So it has time to adjusted structure to 
the new anomalous information,

674
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,190
but blowing into a categorization 
scheme.

675
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,190
Now you have to have a categorization 
scheme because if you don't,

676
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,710
you don't know how to act.
And if it's really global,

677
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,240
like if I tell you,
you say,

678
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:06,630
well how do I write an essay?
And I said you act like a human being.

679
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,703
So this is pretty,
this information is so vague as to be 

680
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:14,080
completely useless for the task at hand.
You want to categorize it,

681
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,933
you want information that's sort of 
sufficiently high resolution so that it 

682
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:18,894
will aid you in your task.
If I blow all your categorization sets 

683
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,730
and you're just left with this really 
amorphous,

684
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,940
amorphous categorization,
you don't know how to act.

685
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:27,774
So you want to maintain your categories.
What he suggested was wasn't the dream 

686
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:35,130
slowly moving almost information up into
that categorization schemes.

687
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,460
So,
and in terms of your question,

688
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,953
well if you,
if you constantly ignore anomalous 

689
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:45,900
information pouring in from the right 
hemisphere,

690
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:46,734
basically what you've done is categorize
more and more information into the 

691
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,400
category of things that are so terrible 
they can't be faced.

692
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,100
And I think what you do under those 
circumstances,

693
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,620
you activate a monster,
so to speak,

694
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,513
that lives in your right hemisphere.
And it gets more and more and more 

695
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:06,741
powerful until one day when at a weak 
moment say it just swallows you whole.

696
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,333
And that's when you fall catastrophic.
We into depression or into terrible 

697
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:12,654
anxiety or maybe even depending on your 
physiological predisposition to 

698
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:18,380
something resembling schizophrenia.
So Katie,

699
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,220
you keep,
because all that information that you've

700
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,560
encountered that's anomalous and scag 
rocks,

701
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,700
you categorize it by avoiding it.
And the category is so terrible.

702
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,920
I can't face it.
So you think that if you integrate it,

703
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,030
you don't end up with nightmares?

704
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,673
Yes,
that's right.

705
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,920
That's right.
Although if you haven't been integrating

706
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:35,754
and then you start,
the nightmares might increase in 

707
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:40,770
intensity.
And it's also the case that when you are

708
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:41,521
dreaming,
you know,

709
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,390
your,
your,

710
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,850
uh,
your spinal cord,

711
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,043
your reticular activating system,
the part is activating the hippocampus 

712
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:49,434
and the Amygdala.
And that's the part of the brain that 

713
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:54,840
deals with anomalous information.
It reverts to two brainstem control.

714
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,680
So it looks to me like this is a good,
this is a reasonable hypothesis.

715
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,220
You have a system that deals with what 
you know and another one that deals with

716
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,780
what you don't do.
You need both.

717
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,330
If you ignore one,
well,

718
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,193
there's a whole social psych literature 
that says if you ignore anomalous 

719
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:10,980
information,
you're happier.

720
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,890
You know,
which is that,

721
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,853
that's a really appalling literature 
because they don't take temporal 

722
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:19,550
duration into consideration.
It's real good in the short term.

723
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,410
What,
what are really,

724
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,953
oh,
there's a whole,

725
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,621
yeah,
that's right.

726
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,454
That's right.
The positive illusions literature is 

727
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:29,310
Taylor or,
yeah.

728
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,791
Yeah.
I mean,

729
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:30,624
it's being,
it's being trashed with empirical data 

730
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:34,650
showing that,
yeah.

731
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:36,730
In the short terms,
good solution for the long term.

732
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,140
You know you get hostile and anxious and
depressed and people don't like you very

733
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:41,860
much,
which is you know,

734
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,800
hardly all that surprising but they 
actually wrote self help books,

735
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,093
self help books telling people that 
positive self legions would good for 

736
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:48,934
mental health man.
Despite like 5,000 years of 

737
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:53,770
philosophical evidence to the contrary,

738
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,793
both of these hemisphere,
right hemisphere working at the same 

739
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,500
time.
When you come across experience,

740
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,570
what would happen to a split brain 
patient?

741
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,690
Is there been any,
any,

742
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,190
well we do know for example that,
I don't know,

743
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,940
I don't know the literature on emotional
responsivity of split brain patients,

744
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:16,240
but I do know that if you sustain right 
frontal cortical damage,

745
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,240
it makes you inappropriately northern 
depressed and anxious.

746
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,313
And what that,
what happens under those circumstances 

747
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:23,770
is that you acquire functional 
psychopathy,

748
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,933
which basically means that psychopath 
doesn't regulate his behavior as a 

749
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,164
consequence of information that 
indicates that his behavioral output is 

750
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,990
doing something that in the long run is 
it's a bad idea.

751
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:35,950
Well,
there's a,

752
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,670
there's a famous paper by Islam and 
demands you about a guy who uh,

753
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,120
can't remember his initials.
He had an Iq of 143,

754
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,540
right frontal damage,
no measurable decrements in Iq.

755
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,990
So he's still 143 is three standard 
deviations above the mean.

756
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:50,824
We're talking very bright person here,
but he makes series of catastrophic 

757
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,950
decisions that look,
that are up,

758
00:39:56,951 --> 00:40:00,340
the sort that you'd associate with 
stupid criminality.

759
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,810
He,
uh,

760
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,250
gets divorced,
he marries Ah,

761
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,820
uh,
uh,

762
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,813
well,
someone who is very bad for him 

763
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:11,380
basically gets involved in a whole 
series of terrible business decisions,

764
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,310
et Cetera,
et cetera.

765
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,630
So if you're missing the information 
from your right frontal Cortex,

766
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,250
you're happy.
No kidding,

767
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,293
because you've knocked out the whole 
system that deals with all those things 

768
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:22,144
that make you unhappy,
but you have to be unhappy to live 

769
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:26,704
properly

770
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,583
when you encounter those things,
the dope go out according to plan 

771
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:32,944
because if you don't attend to those 
things that don't occur according to 

772
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:37,520
plan,
then you don't learn.

773
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:42,040
And if you don't learn,
you keep your model of adaptation stable

774
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,203
in the face of,
in the face of shifting environmental 

775
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:50,131
contingencies and what that basically 
means is that over time the thing that's

776
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:53,230
you gets old and senile and that's how 
it's represented.

777
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,520
Mythology by the way,
and that's the,

778
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,870
that's the image of the wasteland.
No,

779
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,010
that's the land where all the trees have
dried up and everything's all,

780
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:00,883
nothing grows and you can read that as 
the absence of the positive aspect of 

781
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
the great mother,
which means that there's no beneficial 

782
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:13,170
novelty around or you can read that as 
the tyranny of stupid if you all would.

783
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:14,880
Either way.

784
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,713
You're suggesting that.
Are you suggesting that in the apps and 

785
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:21,390
so a connection the left brain will 
dominate?

786
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:22,770
Probably one of them.

787
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,700
I think that's true,
like this is speculative,

788
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,930
but there's some,
there's some physiological evidence like

789
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:31,764
the left brain,
the left hemisphere is in most 

790
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,350
circumstances in schizophrenia.
For example,

791
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,750
if you're a schizophrenia and you start 
hearing voices,

792
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,853
it appears as though there's a 
possibility that the reason for that is 

793
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:42,884
because the areas that are associates 
that are isomorphic with the language 

794
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:50,960
centers but are in the right hemisphere 
have been released from tonic inhibition

795
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,123
by the language centers in the left 
hemisphere and our start to become 

796
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,560
active.
And the way you interpret that is I hear

797
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,510
voices,
they aren't me.

798
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,440
So which,
which suggests to me that who you are as

799
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,274
far as you're concerned is mostly the 
sum total of linguistically mediated 

800
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,684
processes that localized usually the 
left hemisphere but mostly their 

801
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:12,910
linguistic.
We immediate,

802
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,810
which is only to say that mostly what 
you are as far as your own self regard,

803
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:21,811
he's a culturally constructed entity,
most of which has been constructed using

804
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,550
the mediation of language that's up 
settlement.

805
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,553
No,
no one won't be because first of all 

806
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,563
there isn't consciousness.
There's a bunch of processes that are 

807
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:35,174
consciousness now.
Like one consciousness that's clearly 

808
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,350
conscious is what happens to you when 
something enormous occurs.

809
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:46,310
Because you will orient towards that.
And I think orienting is most central to

810
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:48,980
what we define as consciousness.
Because like even in this room,

811
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,843
look,
there's only a few things that you're 

812
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:52,394
really conscious of.
You're very much not conscious as a 

813
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,360
general rule of the floor,
the ceiling,

814
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,040
the walls,
most things around you.

815
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,173
The only thing you're conscious of is 
that part of your experiential field 

816
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,820
where there's some novelty emerging,
right?

817
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,893
That's because you're orienting systems 
are activated and those are critical to 

818
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:09,614
consciousness.
And this is very interesting because in 

819
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:15,110
mythology
and mythology,

820
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:17,000
one of the things that brings about the 
war,

821
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,440
the world is the capacity to 
discriminate between things,

822
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,750
capacity to attend to novelty.

823
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,510
Um,
well I want,

824
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,910
I want to get into that.
Of course,

825
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,000
today's discussion actually
see,

826
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,973
look,
when you're orienting towards things 

827
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,083
you're attending to the world that's 
defined by chaos and transforming it 

828
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,003
with the intermediation of exploration 
into defined territory from the 

829
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:50,270
mythological perspective,
that's equivalent to the construction of

830
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:53,930
the world.
Now that's why in in Christian theology,

831
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,790
for example,
there's the doctrine of the logos.

832
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,220
The logos is being assimilated to 
consciousness.

833
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,930
It's a solar light entity mediated by,
by,

834
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,910
by language.
That's why it's the word.

835
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,833
It's also a simulated to Christ,
and this is not a notion that's unique 

836
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:13,430
to Christianity as we'll see.
That's the thing that creates the world,

837
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,430
creates the world by dividing.
Look,

838
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:19,580
here's an example.
In the earliest Sumerian mess,

839
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,253
there's a dragon who lives in the 
primordial waters and he gives rise to 

840
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,640
two wedded daddy's once the sky and the 
others,

841
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,660
the earth,
they're separate,

842
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:34,500
but not really.

843
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,843
And the way the myth represents that is 
that they're locked in something 

844
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,070
technically called a Hieros Gamos,
which is a mystical marriage.

845
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,470
So they're in sexual union,
they're united.

846
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,483
They're not really two things.
There are union gives rise to a third 

847
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:48,750
force.
That's their sun,

848
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,970
the god of the atmosphere.
As it turns out the scenario,

849
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,100
it's the God is the atmosphere who 
separates them,

850
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,223
pushing the sky up to the sky and the 
first out of the earth and thereby 

851
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:00,540
creates the world.
What the hell does that mean?

852
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,270
Well,
it means that in any creation myth,

853
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:07,380
there's four elements,
chaos and once chaos.

854
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,663
That's the union of everything.
That will one at one point be distinct 

855
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,960
and in sometimes represented methodology
by the Indian,

856
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:19,020
between the mother and the infant,
cause that's sort of symbiotic,

857
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,540
right?
Ones absolutely dependent on the other,

858
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,553
but yet in a sense they're two distinct 
entities where they will be two 

859
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,160
distinctive,
but anyways,

860
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,293
chaos.

861
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,680
That's the dragon
that lives at the bottom of the water.

862
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,390
It gives rise to two days.
Earth and the sky.

863
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,280
They're law,
conceptual union.

864
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,740
They give rise to a sun.
The God of the atmosphere.

865
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,420
This is the sun gone.
He separates them.

866
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,440
That's the world.
Now you could say the world is born as a

867
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,330
consequence of the interaction of the 
sky.

868
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,164
God in the Earth,
God or you could say that the world was 

869
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,630
born as a consequence of the fact that 
the Sun God separates the two.

870
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,140
Most stories are accurate.
All this stories saying you have to look

871
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,930
at the mythological representations.
The story say,

872
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,590
well the earth,
this is chaos there.

873
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,740
If that's a maternal,
that's the mother.

874
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,443
Okay,

875
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,530
that's normal.
It's the source of all things.

876
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,563
Sun.
God separates these two things by 

877
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:32,474
discriminating between them,
which is basically by taking the thing 

878
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:38,540
that's novel and transforming it into 
the thing that's explored.

879
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,470
That means the origin of the cosmos from
the mythological perspective.

880
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,820
So there's three,
there's three seminal out elements in in

881
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,220
your standard creation myth.
The mother,

882
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,240
the father,
and the son,

883
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,230
and the mother is the unknown,
unexplored territory.

884
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,150
The fathers,
the known explored territory and the sun

885
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,950
is the process that mediates between 
them.

886
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,083
And I have assimilated that the 
orienting reflects because it's the 

887
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:05,801
thing that focuses in on novelty,
initiates the process of exploration,

888
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,470
which is the process by which the 
determinant world is form.

889
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,500
Thank well why does the determinant 
world under those circumstances?

890
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:13,783
Well,
it's all those places that you can go 

891
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:20,651
where you know how to behave and those 
places consist of the territory but also

892
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:23,630
the behaviors of everyone else but you 
interact with.

893
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,703
So Nolan territory is social territory 
because all of our actions in habitual 

894
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,063
are defined by the actions of others.
So part of what it is that we know when 

895
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,820
we say we know how to map the actions 
and interactions of others.

896
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,000
So that's why the no one is also similar
culture

897
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,630
and to the Patriarchy and
the cane.

898
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,453
Because of course the king is the 
behavioral model that defines the state 

899
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,103
who everyone in the state imitates so 
that everyone in the state can predict 

900
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,940
everyone else.
That's part of it.

901
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,863
Anyways,
so for me you're explored territory 

902
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,690
because I can define what you're going 
to do with this situation and the reason

903
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,580
I can define us cause we shared the same
story,

904
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,310
which is what we're pursuing.
Goals there are at least concurrent,

905
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,070
they don't conflict because they 
conflicted.

906
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,023
We'd have trouble because you be mapping
things with one motivational 

907
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:18,550
significance and I'd be mapping the Mfi 
other,

908
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,120
which basically means we either have to 
negotiate,

909
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,450
which means you'd arrange your story and
I'd arrange mind or we fight.

910
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,740
That's,
that's it.

911
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:27,574
Those are the two options.
Or I can pretend that the conflict 

912
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,274
doesn't exist,
in which case sooner or later it will 

913
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:32,794
get me.

914
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,723
Now I want to,
because this is a course about social 

915
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:41,970
identity and social conflict.
I want to read you some or get to one,

916
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,813
one sec.
I want to read you some things for 

917
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:44,414
Mircea Eliade because it'll help you.
It will help you understand how it is 

918
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:48,514
that we naturally categorize things.
So you want to remember chaos because 

919
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:54,700
that's the thing that we're,
we're going to discuss.

920
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,623
They'll
chaos is what exists before there's a 

921
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:00,754
separation of subject and object and the
thing that chaos is is then both spirit 

922
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,540
and matter.
Terrible mythological way of speaking.

923
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,510
I'll give you an example of what that 
means.

924
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,853
Piaget said that the subject constructs 
himself as well as the object in the 

925
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:16,654
course of exploration,
which basically means that what you are 

926
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:20,614
formed out of is all those things that 
you discovered as you were approaching 

927
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,730
all those things you didn't know.
Now you form the world has a consequence

928
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:28,564
of the process of exploration,
but you also form yourself because it's 

929
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:32,614
in the process of encounter with novelty
that you generate information and it's 

930
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,000
information that you build your cell 
phone.

931
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,073
So from the mythological world,
the thing that's chaos that existed 

932
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:44,560
before the world existed is composed of 
spirit,

933
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:51,150
which is what you will be and mattered
simultaneously,

934
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,300
which is very,
that sounds very interesting.

935
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:56,530
Quonset.
Okay.

936
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,543
Question.

937
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,670
Oh,
okay.

938
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,133
All alright.
I don't want to go off into different 

939
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:03,950
groups.
No.

940
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:08,950
The symmetry between the pros and goal 
process and then the state one.

941
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:12,830
Chaos state.
Yeah.

942
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,770
And then the known nowhere.
No,

943
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,660
unknown knower.
No.

944
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,553
Yeah.
So the knower is in the place of the 

945
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:21,640
process.

946
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,640
The know raise the process.
So no worries.

947
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,610
The process.
So

948
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,240
becomes the mechanism,
which your body's

949
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,610
the process.
Yeah.

950
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,380
Or something.
Yeah,

951
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,400
that's right.
That's right.

952
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:34,250
And that's what religious stories 
basically push you towards.

953
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,960
That's why I wanted to show you this 
story.

954
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:36,794
Martech.
Martech is the person who encounters 

955
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:38,501
the,
I know.

956
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm the God who attains the highest 
position in the hierarchy of Gods.

957
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,340
Who then goes out to fight time.
Who's the dragon of both?

958
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,010
She's both the dragon of chaos and the 
mother of all things.

959
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:52,910
Those two categories get overlapped some
stairs and in the,

960
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,600
in the fight with timeout,
Marta generates the cosmos.

961
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,930
Now the Mesopotamian King Imitates 
Marduk.

962
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,820
That's what gives him power.
That's,

963
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,713
that's what gives his position validity,
is the fact that he's the embodiment of 

964
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:08,060
the Sun God.
But what does that mean?

965
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,223
Well,
the Sun God is the thing that makes the 

966
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,780
world well.
What does that mean?

967
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,973
Well,
the sunken garden is an image of the 

968
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,820
process of consciousness,
which turns the unknown,

969
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:19,340
which is undefined territory,
into explored territory,

970
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,840
which is the world.

971
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:26,350
And as long as the king,
so then the arcade people say the state,

972
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,370
if the king doesn't do his job,
the state becomes sterile.

973
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:33,200
Crops don't grow,
for example.

974
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,250
And you say,
what the hell?

975
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,770
Trying to quit warrant.
How they all kind of attitude is that if

976
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:38,990
the king doesn't do his job,
crops won't grow.

977
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,113
Well,
what it means is the king is a pattern 

978
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:42,644
of adaptation.
If he doesn't constantly update his 

979
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:50,921
behavioral attributes in the space of 
shifting environmental contingencies,

980
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,770
the beneficial aspect of the environment
will disappear.

981
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,080
So when they are caring,
people says,

982
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,900
if the king doesn't do his job,
then the state becomes say,

983
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:02,690
no crops won't grow there,
Dan.

984
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:03,770
Right.
What do they do?

985
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,990
He killed the king,
sacrifice the king,

986
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,520
or he has to undergo a ritual that 
indicates salary sacrifice,

987
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:11,354
which actually the king of Mesopotamia 
did every new years when he renewed the 

988
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,770
cosmos,
he had to do that.

989
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,480
Cause if he didn't renew the cosmos,
which basically meant update his pattern

990
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:24,110
of behavioral adaptation representation,
then the environment would drift farther

991
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:27,500
and farther away from the state and 
everything would collapse precipitously.

992
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:32,770
So the king had to voluntarily and 
counter novelty or in the long term,

993
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,114
he would catastrophic.
We encounter it along with all those 

994
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,360
people anyway.

995
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,930
Okay.
Last semester.

996
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:45,130
Can you relate that somehow to why money
has value or the use of coins?

997
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,560
Oh yeah.
That's a funny one though,

998
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:47,394
right?
Well,

999
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,860
a gold coin has the,
the head of

1000
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,720
the head of a head of state on it.
Why?

1001
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,823
Well,
the gold is a symbol of the sun and the 

1002
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:02,460
sun is the Sun God and the emperor is 
put on the toy.

1003
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,693
Did you indicate value?
Because this is the thing that is most 

1004
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:08,574
valuable and it's symbolic 
representations of that that we've used 

1005
00:53:11,341 --> 00:53:13,080
to signify province basically.

1006
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,610
So yeah.
Yeah,

1007
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,770
gold is always been assimilated to the 
sun at least in the west,

1008
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:21,604
so okay.
Now I want to read you some things from 

1009
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:24,634
Elliot and I think these things are well
from the perspective of social 

1010
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:32,040
psychology and the notion of 
understanding conflict and the hopes for

1011
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,990
its revolution resolution,
these sorts of things.

1012
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:34,824
I think your revolutionary if you 
understand their significance because 

1013
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:37,974
the only out he basically describes how 
it is that people naturally perceive 

1014
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,390
those who are not like them.
No,

1015
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:43,224
I wouldn't say,
well,

1016
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,700
if I'm like you,

1017
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,720
if I'm like you,
I share your story.

1018
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,350
Okay.
This is a castle.

1019
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,213
We're both inside.
I can construe your relationship to me 

1020
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,350
with regards to our end goal.
That's,

1021
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,980
I also am going to get to this later.
This is also a dominance hierarchy.

1022
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,150
The kings at the top of it and every 
organization is set up that way.

1023
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,763
It's like if you and I are both,
if you and I in a hundred other people 

1024
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,334
are pursuing the same goal,
we organize ourselves into a dominance 

1025
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:26,604
hierarchy.
We each have a position that basically 

1026
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:29,244
constitutes a sub goal of that greater 
goal and the utility of the goals are 

1027
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:33,594
rank ordered in terms of their 
importance and the person who's at the 

1028
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:40,170
top is simultaneously the most important
person in the dominance hierarchy and an

1029
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:44,100
embodiment of the goal.
Chief Executive Officer in a corporation

1030
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:47,400
for example.
How you can also relate that in thinking

1031
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:51,420
about that this week too,
the more complex stories,

1032
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,310
remember it looks like this

1033
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,103
and so on.

1034
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,740
Now the thing that's neat about this is 
this is also you remember,

1035
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:05,574
does everybody remember how this works?
Is that the story is actually consists 

1036
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,490
of sub stories basically all the way 
down.

1037
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,390
Now the higher you are up on the 
dominance hierarchy,

1038
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,950
the closer you are to the broadest 
expanse of this story.

1039
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,680
So if you're just a functionary in an 
organization,

1040
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,813
you have one of these stories and 
anything that comes along to disrupt 

1041
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:27,414
you,
like if you get fired is only going to 

1042
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,350
bond or people who are working on that 
particular sub goal.

1043
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,980
Now if you're the king or the chief 
executive officer,

1044
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,250
you occupied this territory.
So like in the case of a,

1045
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,084
of a hostile takeover of a corporation,
that means the whole structure is 

1046
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:43,374
potentially disruptive and everyone 
inside that structure feels anxiety and 

1047
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,220
depression because their stories are 
being disrupted.

1048
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,403
Okay.
Now you can also see how groups form in 

1049
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:54,804
relationship to this because you're,
you're most tightly identified with 

1050
00:55:58,561 --> 00:55:59,394
those who share the most at the most,
the broadest subset of your embedded 

1051
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:06,624
stories.

1052
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,193
So

1053
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,283
does that make sense?
Would you say that to response to 

1054
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,340
Kennedy's assassination?
Right.

1055
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,660
Perfect.
Exactly.

1056
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,500
More accurately in the north when the 
North Korean emperor died,

1057
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,560
people said the sun had set,
the sun had permanently,

1058
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,630
people were on the street wailing and 
crying,

1059
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,970
you know,
carrying around pictures of the sun,

1060
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:31,120
God who disappeared because the whole 
state was placed into chaos.

1061
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,820
But at the same thing happens when,
when,

1062
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:35,110
uh,
when Stalin died,

1063
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:35,944
for example,
when any tire and dies because of the 

1064
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:37,954
tire is well in bodies and bodies,
the story of the state killed the 

1065
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,940
tyrant.
Everything collapses.

1066
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,700
People come out in the streets and cry.

1067
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:48,723
Yeah.
Fry points out that people like Queen 

1068
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,083
Elizabeth still draw crowd because lots 
of people still thinking of medieval 

1069
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,870
fashion,
so to speak,

1070
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,930
but more accurately Queen Elizabeth in 
bodies or stories,

1071
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,030
everyone's story.
She's the,

1072
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,433
she's the focal point you could say.
Or She's the person who incarnates the 

1073
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:10,741
abstract and stories now so you can say 
that or overtop of her objective reality

1074
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,690
is laid.
Uh,

1075
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,900
uh,
I don't know how many describe it.

1076
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:19,463
A glamorous
facade that people see you because of 

1077
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:28,360
their subjective interpretations and she
acts out that role.

1078
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,250
That's right.
That's projection.

1079
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,403
Say That's a good example of projection.
They think that what they're so excited 

1080
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:37,150
about is the queen.
It's her attributes.

1081
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,930
But you can say in a sense that's true.
It's what she signifies for behavior.

1082
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,500
But that's not exactly a property of the
object.

1083
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:45,334
No.
Is it?

1084
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,250
Now if you can understand that,
you get very close to understanding what

1085
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:50,590
it is that our people are referring to,
what they were referring to.

1086
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:55,590
A God cause it Queen Elizabeth in a 
sense is an incarnated to go out and

1087
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,313
the,
the more potent gods occupied broader 

1088
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,080
domains of the story.
You know what the Mesopotamians said,

1089
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,750
and this is the core for religious 
stories in general,

1090
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,520
is that the thing that should be at the 
top of the hierarchy is Marta,

1091
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,570
right?
Marduk was elected by all the other gods

1092
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:18,220
to be the cane gone.
He's the process by which it normally is

1093
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,054
transformed into explored territory and 
what that basically means that if in 

1094
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,364
your hierarchy of values was placed 
above all else is the necessity of 

1095
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:33,340
responding to a normally every time it 
manifests itself,

1096
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,353
then all your other biological systems 
that determine value will operate 

1097
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,014
properly.
And if you put something else in the 

1098
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:45,580
place of that
God,

1099
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:46,443
so to speak,
then sooner or later everything will 

1100
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,750
fall into chaos.
That's that.

1101
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,023
That's what those mythological stories 
and try to tell people that your 

1102
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:58,420
attitude towards anomaly that determines
everything and you have two choices.

1103
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,200
You to face it voluntarily or no,
and if you don't,

1104
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:03,034
well,
that's why we're reading Milton's 

1105
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,374
paradise lost because Milton's paradise 
lost is a story about the consequences 

1106
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:14,380
of voluntarily voluntary failure to 
admit to the existence of the normally.

1107
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,900
Okay.
Now,

1108
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,160
so you see,
you read the story of Martech,

1109
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,390
the Samarian myth.
It's very,

1110
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:25,370
very interesting.
You say all those gods,

1111
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,280
they organized themselves into a 
dominance hierarchy,

1112
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,890
so they're threatened by timeout.
She's the dragon of chaos.

1113
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,260
She con she caused the dude's unexplored
territory.

1114
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,340
She's going to destroy all the gods,
create creator.

1115
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,174
God's always do that and that's because 
the unknown generates everything and 

1116
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:42,284
takes everything back,
so it has this ambivalent motivational 

1117
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:45,044
status,
the source of everything kind of place 

1118
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:49,160
that everything returns to.
It's a constant threat.

1119
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,560
It never goes away.
There's always something you don't have.

1120
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:52,663
You don't expect to deal with.
The gods organized themselves into a 

1121
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:57,620
hierarchy and they put Marta cat the 
talk.

1122
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,330
Then he's the king.

1123
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,133
Okay.

1124
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,393
It seems to me that what that story is 
telling you with regards to the 

1125
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:11,200
construction of the dominance hierarchy 
is two things.

1126
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,333
It's first of all,
the Mesopotamian society was the 

1127
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:18,460
consequence of the intermingling of a 
whole set of cultural groups.

1128
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,413
Each of them had their own God,
which is basically their own 

1129
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:25,540
representation of the highest ideal,
projected more or less into the external

1130
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:26,374
world.
Now there was a lot of differences 

1131
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:28,174
between these representations,
but in the process of becoming one 

1132
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:34,630
culture,
all these gods had to fight it out,

1133
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,464
so to speak,
for dominance in the territory defined 

1134
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:39,394
by interpersonal communication.
And the myth of Marta climbing the 

1135
01:00:42,581 --> 01:00:43,414
dominance hierarchy is the story,
the cumulative story of the combat 

1136
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:49,620
between these gods and the rise of one 
clock,

1137
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:54,250
two preeminent status.
Now you can see at the end here,

1138
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,263
yeah,
on page 96 I don't know how many of you 

1139
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:03,724
have your book,
but Marduk still in the Sumerian Myth 

1140
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:07,564
Mesopotamian myth.
Martin still has a whole bunch of sort 

1141
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:14,551
of other names that were likely the 
names of gods who sooner or later became

1142
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:15,394
assimilated to Marduk.
He sort of took over their domain and 

1143
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:23,650
the Mesopotamian said that mark had,
I don't remember how many names cst,

1144
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,383
and here are some of them.
And so what the Mesopotamians basically 

1145
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:30,340
concluded unconsciously,
so to speak,

1146
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,623
was that whenever Martech represented 
was also vital to what all these other 

1147
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:35,314
names representative.
And here are some of the names he's Nam 

1148
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:40,990
to lack of who's the God who restores to
life.

1149
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,123
Okay.
That he's describing his role in the 

1150
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:46,720
process that we

1151
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,500
I'm talking about.
Yes.

1152
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,390
Okay.
Chaos.

1153
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:55,620
Impulse.
Yeah.

1154
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,383
Yeah.

1155
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,380
When the Mesopotamia Martech is the God 
who restores to life,

1156
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:03,480
this is what they need.
Here's this process,

1157
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,400
this being read as death,
stale state rejuvenation process.

1158
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:11,964
That's more deck.
That's named number one who can restore 

1159
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:18,270
all ruined gods as though they were his 
own creation.

1160
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:22,140
The God Lord who who by holy incantation
restores the dead thoughts to light.

1161
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,670
Same thing.
This is the dad doors and you can say,

1162
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,504
well why is that
while your behavioral patterns of 

1163
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:31,344
adaptation or the consequences in the 
final analysis of your mimicry of all 

1164
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,310
those people who came before you and 
established moans,

1165
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:43,350
exploration driven modes of adaptation,
which is to say that what do you consist

1166
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:44,184
of in terms of your behaviors is the 
cumulative behaviors of your whole 

1167
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:48,414
culture in so far as those would be 
adaptively relevant and most of those 

1168
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,224
were established by people who are now 
dead ancestral fingers in many 

1169
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:56,394
religions,
the ancestral figures or assimilated to 

1170
01:02:57,781 --> 01:03:00,330
God and that's because they determine 
your behavior.

1171
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,553
Then when
the unknown is the domain of the dead 

1172
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:07,200
gone.
So that's basically,

1173
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,483
there's an interesting little side is a 
piece of knowledge I know about you as 

1174
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,420
if you were completely identified with 
your culture,

1175
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:16,254
Your radiology snake.
It means you're the product of people 

1176
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:20,840
who lived before you,
not your own original thought.

1177
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:22,620
Cause you buy den,
you've adapted the dogma,

1178
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,240
which defines you.
It's not you.

1179
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:29,550
It's the construction of people who were
damned ideologically Huh.

1180
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,640
The catchword of an ideology as a 
slogan.

1181
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,020
Slogan is derived from the Welsh.
Like Gareth slowly,

1182
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,430
Gareth means battle crime.
Yeah.

1183
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:43,780
Which is a nice commentary on etiology.
Okay.

1184
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,660
Um,
yes.

1185
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,150
So it seems to,
okay,

1186
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:49,610
so the right hemisphere seems to be 
what,

1187
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,040
what the process is doing,
what the king is doing.

1188
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,860
They're the ones that are going out into
the unknown and the other ones that are,

1189
01:03:54,861 --> 01:03:57,590
that are using what they find,
um,

1190
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,570
just for adaptive behavior.

1191
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,270
Okay.
Hang on one note now.

1192
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,990
It's not exactly right.
Okay.

1193
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,590
Look chaos.
That's the dragon,

1194
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,260
so to speak.
That's the possibility.

1195
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,080
That's the unknown before it's being 
contacted.

1196
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,543
It's the unknown.
Hypothetically is the fact that behind 

1197
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:18,714
everything that you know,
there's this reality that you can say 

1198
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:26,091
anything about something that you 
actually encounter that's unexpected,

1199
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,340
that's the manifestation of the unknown 
in your experience.

1200
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,470
That's in the normally,
okay.

1201
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,320
The right hemisphere is responsible for 
point.

1202
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,853
I think in conjunction with the limbic 
system is responsible for pointing out 

1203
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,023
the fact of a normal is just to say that
if you're pursuing your goal directed 

1204
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:50,220
linguistically mediate plans and 
something you didn't expect or curves,

1205
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,353
then you're septal hippocampal and to 
make delek systems grab your motor 

1206
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:57,930
behavior on your intention and force of 
towards the anomaly.

1207
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,303
Then you had,
then you make a decision process or 

1208
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,484
ignore and the thing that makes the 
decision I think is the left is left 

1209
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:06,834
hemisphere.
It's the thing that decides whether it 

1210
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:11,990
will voluntarily make the descend or 
will reject it.

1211
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:14,903
So then what is it that,
because I think we experienced chaos 

1212
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,273
from the aspect of perspective when 
we're completely dominated by the 

1213
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:25,744
processes of the right hemisphere,
which is to say the ASTEC does aspects 

1214
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:30,090
of Keanna,
sorry,

1215
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,933
basically anxiety,
depression and while I think the third 

1216
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,590
category is sort of schizophrenia length
symptomatology,

1217
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,870
this is right here,
Mr mediated.

1218
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,300
We did not like that.
When when?

1219
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,330
When your brain has flipped,
the woman is from the left hemisphere in

1220
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:51,850
the right hemisphere,
you feel like dying.

1221
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,520
In fact,
you might commit suicide.

1222
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,093
[inaudible] that's,
I mean that's part of the reason why 

1223
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:01,204
people are very motivated not to bend.
The intention is to it to a normally is 

1224
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:08,560
the vase and its first manifestation.
It's anxiety provoking and painful.

1225
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,203
But you have to balance that against 
knowledge than if you don't pay 

1226
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:13,054
attention to it.
All that will happen is that it will 

1227
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,084
grow until instead of you facing it,
it will attack you likely when you're 

1228
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,693
weak.

1229
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:22,850
Okay,
so,

1230
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,980
so you have this anomalous pieces of 
information.

1231
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:29,480
Remind him as your focus is on the left 
hemisphere says go after it or not,

1232
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,720
or or ignore it and then does it then 
call again to the right hemisphere to,

1233
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,100
to,
to use patterns to identify it,

1234
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:37,280
et Cetera.
And then,

1235
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,141
well,
we'll keep that.

1236
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,840
So that's a good question because the 
thing about an anomalous experiences,

1237
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:44,290
it doesn't present herself purely in 
our,

1238
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,510
in in its objective manifestation.
Let me give you an example.

1239
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,400
So you're sitting in your apartment at 
night,

1240
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,170
it's quiet and you hear a noise that 
shouldn't be in another room.

1241
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,350
Okay,
so you're reading,

1242
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,270
they have disrupts your reading.
I'd say here's something fall over.

1243
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,250
Something big that disrupts your 
reading.

1244
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:03,950
It's like your goal directed activity 
has,

1245
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,870
has been eliminated.
It's like your alert,

1246
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,030
you wait,
you might even wake up if you're asleep,

1247
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,480
but you're alert.
So you walk cautiously.

1248
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,180
But you might run out of the house.
That's one way of dealing with air.

1249
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,193
You might fall in the police,
but let's say you decide to explore 

1250
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,720
while you're conflicted because you are 
driven towards it,

1251
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:22,790
but you're also angry,
anxious.

1252
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:23,863
So you walked towards the room and let's
say the doors are like this and it's 

1253
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:34,541
dark in there and you reach your hand in
to trouble like you watch what your mind

1254
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:35,180
does.

1255
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,013
When you do that,
say if you watch the pictures the 

1256
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,610
degenerate because it's trying to figure
out what the hell is in there.

1257
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,653
You'll get all sorts of fantasies about 
the potential things that might be in 

1258
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:47,600
the next group.
If you actually watch yourself do this,

1259
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:49,370
you generate,
what are some of the,

1260
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,353
some of the visions will be more or less
we are less capital on and maybe it's 

1261
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,813
America,
but you also get images that are 

1262
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,090
monstrous,
like that's what's well,

1263
01:07:59,091 --> 01:07:59,924
that's both a hypothesis that your brain
is generating about what might've done 

1264
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,124
it.
A warning that something terrible might 

1265
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:07,570
be in that room because you don't like 
you read it.

1266
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:09,290
Do you know what?
I want to put your hand in there

1267
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,350
and the anomaly all at once because it 
already,

1268
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:15,243
it emerges.
The anomaly emerges in a sense in 

1269
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,510
already categorized for,
that's the thing.

1270
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,400
You never really encounter chaos per se.
As soon as something unexpected happens,

1271
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,630
it's already presenting itself in the 
form of a potential hypothesis,

1272
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,033
so I think you're right.
Hemispheres is doing the pattern 

1273
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:33,950
recognition instantly.

1274
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:35,723
So then it seems like the left 
hemispheres that gets the decision 

1275
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:38,204
maker,
basically it just uses the right 

1276
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:41,040
hemisphere for for,
okay,

1277
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,360
what is,
what is anomalous,

1278
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:43,363
what give me the patterns and then let's
see how to use this for adaptive for my 

1279
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:47,760
adaptive behavior to get to the,

1280
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,130
I think that,
I think that's,

1281
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:51,500
I think that's how it works.
I think the information,

1282
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:56,120
if there's a continuum between entirely 
explored and not explored at all,

1283
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,230
as information moves from the category 
of no unexplored Vol,

1284
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,143
two entirely explored.
It moves across the hemisphere so to 

1285
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:03,224
speak.
So the locale of specialization shifts 

1286
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,260
and there's evidence for this.
I mean the right hemisphere does seem to

1287
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:10,094
be the place where activity takes place 
most particularly when you don't know 

1288
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,720
what the hell you're doing.
Also,

1289
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,583
the other thing that happens is the,
like if you're practicing in new 

1290
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:18,254
activity,
when you first start practicing huge 

1291
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:23,540
areas of the cortex light up and as you 
get good at it,

1292
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,913
the area that's involved gets smaller 
and smaller and smaller and smaller 

1293
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,700
until there's just a tiny center 
somewhere.

1294
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,653
It's really specialized for that 
activity and then it's not conscious 

1295
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:33,330
anymore.
Can you do it automatically?

1296
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,930
Piping and things?

1297
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,590
Well,
I don't know about all right.

1298
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,020
Well I don't know enough about the 
literature on specialization.

1299
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,320
Tell you what for I don't know where 
motor patterns ended up localizing,

1300
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:50,000
for example,
I don't think anybody knows.

1301
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,193
We know that the prefrontal cortex is 
involved in construction and monitoring 

1302
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:56,620
of motor plans when they're first being 
formula,

1303
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,300
but once they're perfected,
where are they go?

1304
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:02,850
It seems still somewhat mysterious.
The uh,

1305
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,873
yeah,
it seems involved in regulating the 

1306
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,290
smoothness of their,
of their,

1307
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:10,124
uh,
of their application and the Basal 

1308
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,220
Ganglia are involved in motor.
I'll put two,

1309
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:17,830
but where are those patterns are 
localize.

1310
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,850
I don't think anybody knows yet.
Seems a bit brash and generalize that to

1311
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,460
have as business.
These are the possible ways,

1312
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,800
separate.
Absolutely.

1313
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:28,190
Patterns of activity.
Yes it is rubbish.

1314
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:29,043
And the thing is is that broadly is,
this is broadly speaking and I don't 

1315
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:33,464
think it's so much a matter of 
hemispheric specialization may be as 

1316
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,110
whether the information is 
linguistically media.

1317
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,690
There's still an image form or whether 
it's an image form.

1318
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:46,390
We're still at the level of behavior so 
I know when you read it just isn't,

1319
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,243
it's you risk simplification to think of
it in terms of hemispheric 

1320
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,200
specialization,
but there's still,

1321
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,250
there's still enough useful information 
to be driving that when you're making to

1322
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,090
make it worthwhile.

1323
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:59,910
So if you were to look at language then 
could you say that that the organization

1324
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:01,890
of thoughts and all that is left 
hemisphere,

1325
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,060
but let style and m the actual thoughts 
coming from the right hemisphere?

1326
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,500
Does it?
It doesn't seem right.

1327
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:12,990
Well,
broadly again,

1328
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:15,690
I would say that there's some evidence 
for that.

1329
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:19,200
Things like style that is pattern 
recognition capacity.

1330
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:21,090
I mean that's,
that's all.

1331
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,980
Like the fond toner on a given type face
for example,

1332
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,940
has nothing to do with the information 
per se.

1333
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:30,420
It's sort of an emergent property or or 
styles and architecture,

1334
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:31,254
literature and so on.
There are patterns there are difficult 

1335
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:33,804
to,
and I think they are related to two 

1336
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:37,440
story and image.
So

1337
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:39,983
I know that you know that the right 
hemisphere is specialized for the 

1338
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:42,744
comprehension of stories.
It is specialized for the comprehension 

1339
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:46,164
of patterns.
It's the hemisphere that's responsible 

1340
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:50,880
for your understanding of music and most
nonverbal cues.

1341
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,880
It broadly specialized for negative 
effect.

1342
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:54,714
So,
and it's also architectonic [inaudible] 

1343
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,013
construct so that it has a left less 
differentiated structure than the left 

1344
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:01,824
hemisphere,
which seems to indicate it's better for 

1345
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:05,520
quick and dirty analysis.

1346
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,470
And I think what it does is use 
metaphor.

1347
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:12,420
It says this unknown thing,
kind of the same attributes as all these

1348
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:14,520
other unexpected things that you've 
already encountered.

1349
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:18,570
So look out.
So which is useful information.

1350
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:20,400
If you don't know anything else about 
the unknown,

1351
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,234
it's good to know that it's like all 
those other things that you already 

1352
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:23,844
encountered that you didn't understand.
But I think what's happened with in 

1353
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:27,834
religious systems in large part is the 
people have constructed images of the 

1354
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:31,764
unknown like Kelly,
and then use those as ritual models 

1355
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,680
against which to practice patterns about
amputation that are specialized.

1356
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,693
Not for anything particular,
but for adaptation to the unknown in 

1357
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:45,684
general.
Because that's really what you have to 

1358
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:48,540
know,
not how to do something,

1359
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,180
but how to do something when you don't 
know how to do anything.

1360
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,530
That's really what you need to know.

1361
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,680
So you get things like the great goddess
who's responsible for death.

1362
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,280
The only thing to her that's acceptable 
is the human sacrifice.

1363
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,590
But what does that mean?
Well,

1364
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:07,530
they originally acting up,
and this says,

1365
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,443
to get from here to here,
to make an adjustment to the fact of 

1366
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,910
chaos requires constant sacrifice.
What?

1367
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:20,070
Sacrifice up at king,
for example,

1368
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:20,904
that the king is a pattern of adaptive 
behavior before you can understand that 

1369
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,200
in the image or semantically yanked it 
out,

1370
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,910
and that's where those rituals come 
from.

1371
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,950
So that plaque,
kate's the goddess,

1372
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,930
endless sacrifice.
Well,

1373
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,670
that's right,
but what is it?

1374
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,683
Well.
It's endless sacrifice of that thing 

1375
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:41,250
that you value most,
which is in fact in the abstract and for

1376
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,040
your current set of beliefs and your 
configuration,

1377
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,993
your view of the world,
the thing you want to give up the least 

1378
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:49,650
because it's the thing that protects you
from emotional chaos.

1379
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:50,813
That's what you have to sacrifice all 
the time in order to adapt to the fact 

1380
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:55,344
of the unknown.

1381
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,510
Okay.
Now back to social psychology.

1382
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,030
I want to read you these things familiar
[inaudible].

1383
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:07,710
This is very interesting
for religious man.

1384
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:08,544
Space is not homogenous.
He experienced his interruptions and 

1385
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:12,724
breaks in it.
Some parts of space are qualitatively 

1386
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:17,650
different from others.
Drawing not nigh.

1387
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:18,484
Hither says the Lord unto Moses,
put off my shoes from off they feet for 

1388
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:23,680
the place where I'm they'll stand is 
holy ground.

1389
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,270
Exodus three five there is then a sacred
space,

1390
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,760
enhance a strong,
significant space.

1391
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:35,530
There are other spaces that are not 
sacred and so our without consistency or

1392
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,740
core structure,
they're amorphous have no definition,

1393
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,593
nor is this all for religious man.
This spatial lauren homogeneity finds 

1394
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:46,750
expression and the experience of an 
opposition between space that is sacred,

1395
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,040
the only real and really existing space 
and all other space,

1396
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,980
the formless expanse that surrounds it.

1397
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:36,963
Okay.

1398
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,223
It must be set at once that the 
religious experience of the [inaudible] 

1399
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:49,610
spaces and primordial experience,
he means by that an archetype experience

1400
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,680
doesn't have to be learned.
It's a structural element of experience.

1401
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:58,110
Homologeo Homo Habilis homologous to the
founding of the world.

1402
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:01,020
It is not a matter of theoretical 
speculation,

1403
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,280
but have a primary religious experience 
that precedes all reflection on the,

1404
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,173
on the world,

1405
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,503
okay.

1406
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:09,343
Or just the break effect in the space 
that allows the world to be cost to to 

1407
01:16:11,671 --> 01:16:12,504
that because it reveals a fixed point.
The central access for all future 

1408
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:17,790
orientation.
When the sacred manifest itself,

1409
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,520
there was not only a break in the emoji 
native space,

1410
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,383
there's also a revelation of an absolute
reality of the non reality of the bass 

1411
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:25,584
around the expanse,
the manifestation of the sacred 

1412
01:16:27,661 --> 01:16:29,430
ontologically founds the world.
Okay.

1413
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:31,570
Now what Eliade is trying to say,
look,

1414
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:35,700
you're a cognitive systems are founded 
upon certain preset positions.

1415
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:37,643
What did I eliade is trying to do,
and this was a guild was trying to do 

1416
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:40,554
too with this idea of vacation with the 
archetype is just to point out what are 

1417
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,064
the most fundamental levels of 
presuppositions upon which all the 

1418
01:16:46,891 --> 01:16:48,570
things that you think.
In fact,

1419
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:52,410
our baits as Kurt Gadell pointed out 
that any,

1420
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:56,460
any internally cysts,
any internal and consistent system,

1421
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,413
logical system is necessarily predicated
on presumptions and the can be approved 

1422
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,520
from within the system.
They have to be accepted.

1423
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,980
Their axioms,
like Deon seems of geometry.

1424
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,850
This is an axiom.
There's defined territory and undefined.

1425
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,630
This is what you protect.
This is where you live.

1426
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,583
It's the establishment of this.
That is the precondition for everything 

1427
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:17,894
else you do.
So establishing that initial sacred 

1428
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:21,320
space,
that's a religious act,

1429
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,120
the primary religious act.

1430
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,610
So what is clear?
So it's clear to what it'd be grieved.

1431
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:30,350
That discovery that is the revelation of
sacred space,

1432
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:32,720
possesses existential value for 
religious man.

1433
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,973
For nothing can begin.
Nothing can be done without a previous 

1434
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:39,140
orientation in any orientation implies 
acquiring a fixed point.

1435
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,473
It is for this reason that religious man
has always sought to fix his abode at 

1436
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:43,904
the center of the world.
That's where the medieval notion that 

1437
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,294
man exists,
whether it be earth was the center of 

1438
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:51,080
the cosmos.
That's where that idea came from.

1439
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:55,400
It wasn't an empirical notion.
It was the notion that wherever we live,

1440
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,503
that's the center that's defined space 
surrounded necessarily by an expanse of 

1441
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:00,974
territory that we haven't explored.
Now we already know to what to make of 

1442
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,104
that in terms of implications because we
know what an unexplored territory 

1443
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:09,860
signifies.
First.

1444
01:18:09,861 --> 01:18:13,160
It's signifies fear and it signifies 
promise.

1445
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,400
So defined territory is security 
established in an expanse of anxiety and

1446
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:22,790
and curiosity.
Funny but eight priority.

1447
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,370
It's anxiety.
So you're a village is surrounded by the

1448
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:27,830
places you don't know because it's 
frightening out there.

1449
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,873
Why is it frightening?
No behavioral structures have been 

1450
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:36,551
erected to make that space habitable.
So it's the domain of monsters.

1451
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,790
It's the domain of wolves.
It's the domain of foreigners.

1452
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:43,520
It's the domain of barbarians.
It's the place that you can explore.

1453
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,473
It's like the old maps,
the whole medieval maps of the world to 

1454
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:51,680
find territory amorphous just surrounded
by ocean with monsters.

1455
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,090
That's what that means.

1456
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,090
There were monsters out there and 
unknown territory.

1457
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:58,710
That's,
it's interesting too,

1458
01:18:58,711 --> 01:19:00,990
cause the most is always take the form 
of whales.

1459
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,910
But Wales aren't whales for medieval 
people.

1460
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,100
And if they didn't know what Wales,
where there are serpents,

1461
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:05,993
sea surface that live in the sea and if 
you go out there out beyond explored 

1462
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,880
territory,
the sea serpent comes out of the sea and

1463
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:12,714
swallows you.
Perhaps the hero's mission right down 

1464
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:17,340
into the belly of the beast.
You might come back and you might not.

1465
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:20,700
But what that is is the projection of 
mythology on the world.

1466
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:25,110
So for the European exploration was an 
extraordinary radical.

1467
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,430
Yeah,
absolutely.

1468
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,650
Absolutely.
Yes.

1469
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:29,430
Yeah,
I did.

1470
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:32,490
Well here I going to tell you exactly 
exactly how radical that was.

1471
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,393
This is something in reality is that 
pains to describe what are the 

1472
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:36,894
outstanding characteristics of 
traditional societies is the opposition 

1473
01:19:39,331 --> 01:19:41,640
that they assume between their inhabited
territory,

1474
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,860
ambien determinant space that surrounds 
it.

1475
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,150
The former is the world more precisely 
our world.

1476
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,200
The cosmos.
So when Marta constructs the cosmos,

1477
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:55,470
that's what that means is he's 
constructing habitable territory,

1478
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:59,400
the definable world out of the amorphous
reality that surrounds it.

1479
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:01,503
Okay?

1480
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,920
Everything outside of the cosmos is no 
longer cosmos,

1481
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:08,040
but it's sort of other world,
a foreign chaotic place by ghosts,

1482
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,420
demons,
foreigners who are assimilated to demons

1483
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,250
into the souls of the dead.
Now this is,

1484
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,010
this is some other research,
that idea.

1485
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:22,011
So this is an insert more specifically 
to the dragon of chaos.

1486
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,640
Okay?
So this is the point here.

1487
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:28,710
Your natural category of foreigner is 
the dragon of chaos.

1488
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,633
They're in the same category.
Not because you've assimilated them 

1489
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:32,754
together,
but because you have not yet 

1490
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,330
distinguished them.
They're still the same thing.

1491
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,283
So your natural response to the 
foreigner is he's the thing that isn't 

1492
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:44,640
human that occupies the space defined by
chaos.

1493
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,320
Who's a primary motivational 
significance is the generation of terror

1494
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:50,154
and disorder.
She say you don't get an explanation 

1495
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:55,640
then about why people are hostile with 
the foreigners.

1496
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,650
What you need is an explanation for 
those few instances where that does not,

1497
01:20:58,651 --> 01:20:59,550
in fact,
they'll curve

1498
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,370
okay?
In,

1499
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:06,000
okay?
Among the Hicks sauce.

1500
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,420
Barbarians were assimilated to Apophis 
who do borrowers?

1501
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,263
The Sun,

1502
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,133
no,
sorry.

1503
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,150
Yeah,
that's right

1504
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,483
Hicks.
Those were barbarians from the Egyptian 

1505
01:21:17,651 --> 01:21:18,484
point of view.
They kept coming into Egypt and 

1506
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:20,254
disrupting everything.
They were assimilate hicks sauce met 

1507
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:23,224
barbarians,
and they were simulated to apophis who 

1508
01:21:25,331 --> 01:21:26,770
devours the sun.
Okay,

1509
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:30,070
so that's the Egyptians among the Indo 
Europeans,

1510
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,990
the ancestors of the mortar,
the Indians,

1511
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,190
the assimilation of enemies in back,

1512
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:35,163
nope,

1513
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:39,890
to the slaying of [inaudible].
In fact,

1514
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:40,873
enemies were called Burton's and Virta 
was the gigantic dragon who held back 

1515
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,790
the waters in the hollow of the 
mountain.

1516
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,270
Interests laid him and constructed the 
world.

1517
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:51,104
So for the Indo Europeans,
the slang and enemies was precisely 

1518
01:21:53,751 --> 01:21:55,760
equivalent to the act that constructed 
the world.

1519
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:57,710
And that is because when you slay your 
enemies,

1520
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:58,544
you expand your territory in the 
expansion of territory is equivalent 

1521
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,860
construction in the world.
It's a heroic enterprise.

1522
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:09,130
You're battling the enemies of the state
among the Zoroastrians and the ram.

1523
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,480
He will,
trump's in the battle.

1524
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,280
He truly kills me.
I'm sorry,

1525
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:16,383
the fight of the hero three tournament 
against the dragon as they hakka is 

1526
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:23,650
recounted as the struggle of King Fair 
done against the foreign new surfer,

1527
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,960
the dragon as to hack and it's the same 
story.

1528
01:22:25,961 --> 01:22:29,290
This is an arrhenius foreigners or the 
dragon of chaos.

1529
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:33,100
They bring disorder into the state,
so to overthrow the forerunner,

1530
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:33,963
to establish new territories to to the 
same thing that the day he did what he 

1531
01:22:36,611 --> 01:22:38,080
established the world

1532
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:43,770
now.
Okay.

1533
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:47,070
At first this cleavage,
the first side.

1534
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:47,913
This cleavage in space appear to be due 
to the opposition between an inhabited 

1535
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:51,303
and organize hands,
cosmo sized territory and the unknown 

1536
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:54,604
space that expands beyond its frontiers.
On one side there's a cosmos on the 

1537
01:22:58,031 --> 01:23:01,270
other side of cameras,
but we shall see that if every inhabited

1538
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:02,104
territory is a cosmos,
this is precisely because it was first 

1539
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,113
consecrated because in one way or 
another it is the work of the garden 

1540
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,793
cards or is in communication with the 
world of the guards who determine 

1541
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:12,334
destiny in that territory and who 
therefore caused the toothy organizing 

1542
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:15,754
principles of the society,
the dominance hierarchy that rules 

1543
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:19,114
there.

1544
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,420
That's the thing,
you know,

1545
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,430
inside say can space.
You're all,

1546
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,580
you're pursuing a goal that's shared by 
everyone else that's in that space.

1547
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:27,414
So their behavior is all random,
predictable as a consequence of their 

1548
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:33,330
participation in the same story.
It's a religious story.

1549
01:23:33,331 --> 01:23:35,760
This defined by the dominance of the 
certain God.

1550
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,893
So when you go out into new territory,
the first thing you do is consecrate 

1551
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,820
that new territory to the God that rules
your territory.

1552
01:23:41,821 --> 01:23:44,280
So the order rules,
order rains there,

1553
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,430
that means the world's created and what 
it means,

1554
01:23:47,431 --> 01:23:51,870
that order range there is that whenever 
other people go there,

1555
01:23:51,871 --> 01:23:54,090
they have to behave the same way you 
behave.

1556
01:23:54,091 --> 01:23:54,924
So they're predictable.
So that means they're out of the domain 

1557
01:23:56,941 --> 01:23:59,220
that's defined by CAS.
And they don't terrify.

1558
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:00,054
You don't undermine.
They don't pose the possibility of 

1559
01:24:03,241 --> 01:24:05,220
undermining everything that it is that 
you believe in.

1560
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:06,443
So lem,
it says all this appears very clearly 

1561
01:24:08,881 --> 01:24:09,714
from the thing that ritual for taking 
possession of the territory that 

1562
01:24:12,611 --> 01:24:16,050
shouldn't becomes legally valid through 
the erection of a fire alter consecrated

1563
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:16,884
to Agni.
Is this a quote from the religious 

1564
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:21,570
texts?
The shout of path that Brovana one,

1565
01:24:21,571 --> 01:24:23,480
he says that what is installed,
when,

1566
01:24:23,481 --> 01:24:24,314
what has built a fire altered and all 
those who build the fire alter our 

1567
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:28,260
legally established.
Okay,

1568
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,570
so this is rules for in California,
New Territory

1569
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,160
by the erection of a fire alter Agni is 
made present.

1570
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,150
You see a fire,
the erection of a firewall to,

1571
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,710
that's a symbol of the construction of 
civilization,

1572
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,573
right?
And because the mastery of fire is 

1573
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:46,950
something that is absolutely integral to
the establishment of border anyways,

1574
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,930
but the meaning of the ritual is far 
more complex.

1575
01:24:50,931 --> 01:24:52,670
And if we consider all of its 
ramifications,

1576
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:53,504
we shall understand why concentrating 
your territory is equivalent to making 

1577
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:56,654
it a cosmos for in fact,
the erection of an alternate Agni is 

1578
01:24:58,941 --> 01:25:02,270
nothing but the rep production on the 
microcosmic scale of the creation,

1579
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,610
the water in which the clay is mixed,
the clay.

1580
01:25:04,611 --> 01:25:08,330
So the altered is assimilated to the 
primordial water chaos.

1581
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,900
The client that forms the base of the 
altar symbolizes the earth.

1582
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,930
The lateral walls represent the 
atmosphere and so on.

1583
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,063
And the building of the alters and 
company by songs that proclaim which 

1584
01:25:17,991 --> 01:25:19,880
caused region.
It's just being created.

1585
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,073
Hence the erection of a fire altered 
which alone validates taking possession 

1586
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:24,374
of her new territory is equivalent to 
the construction of the world and I'm 

1587
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:32,930
known for an unoccupied territory which 
usually means unoccupied by our people.

1588
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,230
Still shares in the fluid and larva 
modality of chaos,

1589
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:37,903
my occupying it and above all by 
settling it man symbolically transform 

1590
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:43,120
it,
it transforms it into a cosmos,

1591
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,560
through a ritual repetition of the 
creation of the world.

1592
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,903
What is to become our world must first 
be created and every creation as a 

1593
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:53,030
paradigmatic mortal creation of the 
universe by the guards.

1594
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,483
When the Scandinavian calling this,
this took position of Iceland and 

1595
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:58,700
cleared it,
they regarded the enterprise.

1596
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:02,210
Neither has an original undertaking,
nor is human and profane work.

1597
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,433
For them.
The was the repetition of a priority 

1598
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:08,060
will act and transformation of chaos 
into cosmos by the divine.

1599
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:10,970
After creation.
When they tilt the deserted soil,

1600
01:26:10,971 --> 01:26:12,780
they were in fact repeating the act of 
the gardens.

1601
01:26:12,781 --> 01:26:15,020
So was organized chaos by giving it a 
structure,

1602
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,003
forums and norms,
whether it is a case of clearing 

1603
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:19,403
uncultivated grown or conquering and 
occupying and territory already 

1604
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:24,470
inhabited by other human beings.

1605
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,513
Ritual taking possession must always 
repeat the cosmogony from the view of 

1606
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:29,144
archaic societies.
Everything that is not our world is not 

1607
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,144
yet the world.
The territory can only be made ours by 

1608
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:37,390
creating a new this religious behavior 
and respect.

1609
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:42,120
Unknown lands continued even in the west
down to the daughter of in times Spanish

1610
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:42,954
and Portuguese.
Conquistadores discovering and 

1611
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:47,520
conquering territory is took possession 
of them in the name of Jesus Christ.

1612
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:51,090
The raising of the cross was equivalent 
to Carson crating which country?

1613
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,970
Hanson some way to a new birth for 
through Christ.

1614
01:26:53,971 --> 01:26:57,120
All things are passed away.
Behold all things become new.

1615
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,223
Two Corinthians five 17 the newly 
discovered country was the nude 

1616
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:03,540
recreated by the cross.
Of course,

1617
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,290
and when the Americans landed on the 
moon,

1618
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:07,140
the first thing they did was put up the 
American flag.

1619
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:13,000
It's a profane repetition of precisely 
the same notions.

1620
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:13,923
This is this undiscovered territory is 
now part of the world order rules there 

1621
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:19,404
in North Carolina.

1622
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:25,030
So also Lord,
through the ritual after that,

1623
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:30,490
because like in the
bag agonize like the fire guys,

1624
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,610
your guide of transformation.
So if you're transforming that land from

1625
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:38,533
that,
which is honest,

1626
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:39,523
it that which is explore,
right and thereby making it 

1627
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:45,650
simultaneously sacred part of it.
Sacred territory.

1628
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,513
Yep.
Okay.

1629
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,360
Yup,
that's right.

1630
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,193
That's exactly right.
In the ritual that you undergo when 

1631
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:53,900
you're creating the fire temple is 
equivalent to participating in the act.

1632
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:55,760
For example.
That's defined by Marduk.

1633
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:58,520
Just the,
the fighting with the Dragon.

1634
01:27:58,521 --> 01:27:59,354
That's reference till I read it.
I think the reason you might think this 

1635
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,590
is completely off the wall,
but I've thought about for a long time,

1636
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:04,940
it makes a certain amount of sense to 
me.

1637
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:08,300
Chaos is represented by a drag.
Why?

1638
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,220
Why are you dragging the urge?
Any dragons?

1639
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,030
But it's partly because the dragon is a 
creature of the of matter because it's a

1640
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:16,450
serpent and it goes around on the ground
and has wings.

1641
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:17,284
So it's also a creature of the air,
so it's a symbol of the union of 

1642
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:20,420
opposites,
right?

1643
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,330
It's also a serpent so it can shed its 
skin and be reborn.

1644
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:25,340
So there's an element of transformation 
in there.

1645
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,790
But I always saw this great picture.
It's a picture from the medieval church.

1646
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:31,460
It's called souls in the grip of hell.
And there's,

1647
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,473
there's a picture of this monstrous 
dragon and inside it's wood carving 

1648
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:37,634
inside.
If there's all these people who have 

1649
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,940
hard,
horrified expressions on their face,

1650
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,880
but maybe being devoured by a serpent.
Now

1651
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:52,040
we share our ascending spinal tracks on 
their limbic system with animals.

1652
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:52,874
The pulling a long ways back on the file
of genetic chain and our limbic system 

1653
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,890
and the cameras.
This is all as amphibians.

1654
01:28:59,160 --> 01:28:59,993
In fact,
the hippocampus first made its 

1655
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:01,584
appearance win.
Our rn says to his crawled out of the 

1656
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:04,194
water,
which is kind of kind of interesting 

1657
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:06,474
from a symbolic perspective.
I think the reason that the dragon of 

1658
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:13,110
chaos as symbolized by the dragon is 
because when we fall into that,

1659
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:17,430
our actions and aspects are dominated by
parts of our brain that are so old.

1660
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:18,264
But they still partake in the aspect of 
the world is defined by my reptilian 

1661
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:23,034
potency.

1662
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,033
Anyways,

1663
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:29,200
you can think about that.
I mean I debated whether or not to,

1664
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,753
to make a point about it in this 
manuscript cause it seems to be kind of 

1665
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:33,934
a strange notion,
but the fact is there are dragons 

1666
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,990
everywhere in the world and they're 
representative of something.

1667
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:39,580
Okay.
So we

1668
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,290
thank in these ways and draw these 
distinctions naturally.

1669
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:45,200
It's not a feature of the object.
So we would tend to think of,

1670
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,190
well it depends on how you define the 
object.

1671
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,123
Right?

1672
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,313
Thank you.
These ways,

1673
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,920
even when the territory that we're 
exploring isn't a spacial object,

1674
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,770
even if it's something abstract,
like a concept.

1675
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,140
Absolutely.
Hello.

1676
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,173
Our ideological concepts around,
especially in your logical concepts or 

1677
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:05,150
actually abstract representations of 
adaptive behavioral patterns,

1678
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,340
they're not descriptions of the 
objective world.

1679
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:12,580
Like if you share a Marxist ideology,
Marxist ideology is a body of laws,

1680
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:17,360
which basically means that it's a verbal
representation of a pattern of action.

1681
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,970
This designed to transform order into 
chaos,

1682
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,081
chaos,
and order.

1683
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:23,030
Although with the Marxist state works 
the other way round.

1684
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:24,853
So that's right.
You're any illogical identification is 

1685
01:30:27,681 --> 01:30:30,650
in fact your abs,
your identification with uh,

1686
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,513
with a god of behavior that's become 
abstract that into a higher order 

1687
01:30:34,191 --> 01:30:35,390
philosophy.
Okay.

1688
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:36,224
But don't you think,

1689
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,213
I mean obviously in those situations 
then you can use that as an impetus to 

1690
01:30:39,201 --> 01:30:40,034
fight or to have more.

1691
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,180
Okay.

1692
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,013
In some cases the fact that it's not a 
spacial object or a literal possession 

1693
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,550
or territory or land might change the 
way that we approach it.

1694
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,430
I mean we'd still approach it in the 
same way in our mind,

1695
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,313
but the consequence,

1696
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,610
no,
I think it's worse.

1697
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:54,503
I think it's worse because look if was,
if you've taken it on the wall then you 

1698
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:58,404
train it so that it,
so that it's adapted to a territory you 

1699
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:02,244
can't come along and have an argument 
with it and thereby undermine its whole 

1700
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:05,994
sequence of that applications.
Like once the animal is gone and sat 

1701
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:08,724
down,
station fixed about the only thing you 

1702
01:31:09,871 --> 01:31:12,720
can do to really follow it up is to 
shift its environment.

1703
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:13,554
Like you can move it somewhere else.
But if you have abstracted your patent 

1704
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:19,770
and about adaptation up into an ideology
that's verbally mediate,

1705
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:20,813
and I'd come along with a set of 
principles that it make logical 

1706
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:25,860
nonsense.
If some of your presuppositions,

1707
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:26,933
I can blow apart whole schemes of you're
an adaptation in the course of say an 

1708
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,613
afternoon and it might take a long time 
for the consequences of that to like 

1709
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,560
have their effect on all your structures
about amputation.

1710
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,860
But the point is is that one side 
transformed my adaptations into words.

1711
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,740
I can adapt abstract and that's where 
the useful,

1712
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,633
right?
I mean I can build potential adaptive 

1713
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:48,690
models in the abstract without having to
ask them.

1714
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:50,220
No,
that's the positive side.

1715
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:53,760
But the negative side is this.
Once I can abstract out the principles,

1716
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:54,623
I'm really vulnerable to an argument.
And what an argument is is a war that 

1717
01:31:57,431 --> 01:31:58,264
sparked with works and if it fails then 
we just cascade down the chain of 

1718
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:04,470
abstraction to the actual part of the 
way.

1719
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:05,670
So

1720
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:06,503
I'm not going to ask you about.
So I guess what I'm trying to get at is 

1721
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:11,830
something more like if there,
like if there is a fertile valley,

1722
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:15,010
10 miles outside of mine order and 
you're there.

1723
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:16,900
I have to,
if I'm not going to cooperate with you,

1724
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:17,734
I have to kill you in order for me to 
have that in order for me to explore it 

1725
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:21,004
and for it to be mine.
But if I'm studying astrophysics and 

1726
01:32:23,741 --> 01:32:24,574
you're an astrophysicist in China,
I don't necessarily have to kill you in 

1727
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:28,414
order for me to be able to study even 
the exact same thing that you're 

1728
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,053
studying.
But you kill this person by firing off 

1729
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:37,180
letters undermine.

1730
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,030
Sure.
Well look,

1731
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:39,840
that's it.
That's it.

1732
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,810
No,
that's a good,

1733
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,943
that's a good example because there's no
necessary reason why a scientific model 

1734
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:52,510
has to simultaneously take on the effect
of Valence of an adaptation or more.

1735
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:57,430
But to the degree that your career is 
contaminated with your ideas,

1736
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:01,030
you're going to respond to your 
competitors as if they were enemies.

1737
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,300
So if you've abstracted yourself from 
your objective ideas,

1738
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:07,090
which basically means if you have a 
light,

1739
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,610
it's independent of your scientific 
beliefs,

1740
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,720
then you can treat them as objective 
elements and there's no necessary reason

1741
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,480
for you to get your emotions involved.
But the truth,

1742
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,510
like the real situation tends not to be 
that way.

1743
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:23,890
As the people get their objective 
pictures tangled up with their religious

1744
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:24,724
beliefs,
and then they do view attacks on their 

1745
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:27,394
domain as personal attacks.
But you're not supposed to do that in 

1746
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:30,400
science.
In fact,

1747
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,593
science is actually the mechanism 
whereby we separate those two types of 

1748
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,450
models,
but it doesn't always work.

1749
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,370
So,
so it seems

1750
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:44,160
like if you're like,
like when you're literally exploring the

1751
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:47,820
actual physical world,
it's absolutely inevitable there's going

1752
01:33:47,821 --> 01:33:48,654
to be physical violence and conflict.
And there's no even possibility of 

1753
01:33:50,971 --> 01:33:51,721
getting around that.
I mean,

1754
01:33:51,721 --> 01:33:54,180
in principle that isn't necessarily part
of it.

1755
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,313
But then so is it wrong to say then that
when you're no longer studying the 

1756
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,143
physical world and when you're studying 
more abstract things that most likely 

1757
01:34:03,481 --> 01:34:05,010
you're probably still going to behave 
the same way,

1758
01:34:05,011 --> 01:34:07,110
but there's at least the possibility 
that you can,

1759
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,151
no,
I wouldn't say,

1760
01:34:08,151 --> 01:34:08,630
okay.
I will.

1761
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:09,463
No,
I wouldn't say that like I don't think 

1762
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,040
if you're studying things that are 
objective,

1763
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:13,874
you have in principle the possibility of
being objective about when you didn't 

1764
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,700
have to fight over it.
If there's one thing and we both won and

1765
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:21,390
won't cooperate,
we must for sure it

1766
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,870
didn't like about your apartment.
Right?

1767
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,500
Right.
There are all like your,

1768
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:31,490
your first premise was the bloodshed was
a necessary intermediate.

1769
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,890
Okay,
but that's not one of the things we want

1770
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:34,724
to do in this course.
The reason that I'm interested in the 

1771
01:34:36,841 --> 01:34:39,380
structure of myth to begin with is to 
figure out,

1772
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,060
look,
here's your alternatives.

1773
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:47,750
If I let your ideas in my head and then 
I end up in chaos,

1774
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,780
that's one option.
Okay,

1775
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:51,900
so I don't let you,
right.

1776
01:34:51,901 --> 01:34:54,350
Isn't the body you have by killing you?
That's another option.

1777
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:55,543
Now,
both of those options seem to me to be 

1778
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,040
pretty,
pretty distressing.

1779
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,490
You can't expect me to give up 
everything I believe in just because you

1780
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:03,860
have different idea.
By the same token,

1781
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:04,873
if the only way that we can settle our 
disputes is through force and you'll 

1782
01:35:06,851 --> 01:35:08,090
have an involvement.
I have one,

1783
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:10,010
well that's pretty much the end of the 
story in there too,

1784
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:11,053
so it's sort of anxiety,
depression and the possibility of 

1785
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:18,230
suicide and cultural degeneration on one
side or like conflict.

1786
01:35:18,231 --> 01:35:20,240
It will kill us both on the other side.
Right.

1787
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,160
Those are the,
you might describe those as the horns of

1788
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:24,260
a dilemma,
but then the question is,

1789
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,220
well,
given that dilemma,

1790
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,560
what's the,
is there an alternative path?

1791
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,603
Well,
that's what we're hopefully going to 

1792
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:32,990
define mostly in the second part of the 
course because that's the dilemma.

1793
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:33,824
It's a terrible dilemma mean before if 
you had an ax as stone axes and sticks 

1794
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,010
and so did I,
and we have fight,

1795
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,873
well,
there was at least the possibility that 

1796
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,430
one of our groups wasn't going to end 
up.

1797
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,343
But now when we're talking about 
territorial disputes between hours that 

1798
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:53,291
are fully armed,
the possibility for settling the problem

1799
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,463
violently.
It doesn't even exist unless you're 

1800
01:35:56,211 --> 01:35:57,044
willing to,
unless you'd be willing to kill me 

1801
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,180
unless you'd be willing to die just to 
kill me.

1802
01:36:02,181 --> 01:36:03,014
Which of course is always a possibility.
And it's now like how deep your desire 

1803
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:09,700
for revenge action is.
So,

1804
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:12,120
so the middle road is always a 
compromise or having,

1805
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,973
because your copper,
if you have an argument with Sonia 

1806
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,190
men's,
you take a little of their idea and then

1807
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:18,720
it'll enough of yours so that you're so 
that you're going to get along.

1808
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:19,963
And if you have a,
if you're have a more sort of physical 

1809
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:22,424
situation,
you're just compromised in terms of 

1810
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:26,210
getting what you want.
Isn't that,

1811
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:27,044
isn't that exactly what,
what culture is is compromised so that 

1812
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:29,774
everyone,
well a certain part of your providers 

1813
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:34,670
because if you had are modifying our 
behavior in some territory,

1814
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:36,710
part of it's dispute,
but part of it's,

1815
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:40,730
well if you do this I'll reward you and 
if I do this you'll reward me.

1816
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,210
And so like it's positive mutual,
a modification,

1817
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:47,270
but also words.
I can't have everything I could possibly

1818
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:48,790
want.
I mean if I could just have everything I

1819
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:49,624
could possibly want,
I would not function and this economic 

1820
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,350
function in society.
All right,

1821
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:53,990
right.
You get,

1822
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:54,823
what you do is essentially theoretically
is you'd give up some immediate 

1823
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:00,950
gratification for the longterm protect 
possibility.

1824
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:01,784
I've continued stable gratification.
I mean that's one way of looking at it 

1825
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,060
or at least being able to live in 
society,

1826
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:09,440
which I have to do.
Right,

1827
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:10,370
exactly.
Exactly.

1828
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:12,530
That's the social contract sort of 
notion right now.

1829
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:15,800
So,
but you said compromise and I would say,

1830
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:17,350
well rather,
so if you know,

1831
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,193
here's your negative option one,
which is I kill you and here's maybe 

1832
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,523
option two,
which is I listened to you and thereby 

1833
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:26,090
lose all my faith.
Well then the question is like,

1834
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,073
is there some need a principal that 
isn't either of these that can be used 

1835
01:37:30,831 --> 01:37:31,580
instead of them?

1836
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,413
And I would say,
well that's why we're studying what 

1837
01:37:34,011 --> 01:37:34,844
Marta represents.
Because I would say at the core of all 

1838
01:37:37,821 --> 01:37:38,654
belief systems is a representation of 
the process by which the belief system 

1839
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:44,264
was erected,
which is the most important thing about 

1840
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:47,770
the belief system.
So if you're,

1841
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:51,710
you have belief system may that you're 
like dogmatically attached to and I have

1842
01:37:51,711 --> 01:37:53,930
a belief system B and I'm dogmatic,
the attached to it.

1843
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,920
And I point out to you that despite our 
differences that the core,

1844
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:58,773
the most important thing is something 
that we actually both agree about that 

1845
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:05,220
might help in some way smooth the 
possibility of transition.

1846
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:08,970
It would also make us at least 
reasonable negotiators because,

1847
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:11,220
well,
here's an example.

1848
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,180
You have to see if I want to negotiate 
with you,

1849
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:20,040
we need a higher order point of 
reference that defines the rules because

1850
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:20,874
otherwise I might make an agreement with
you and then just like how don't you 

1851
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:24,810
went to shreds is the first chance like,
yeah,

1852
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,380
right?

1853
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,190
So you have to be able to trust me even 
to begin the process of negotiation.

1854
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:31,560
So I would say,
well this is a weird example,

1855
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:32,394
but let's say in,
in the Christian marriage ceremony and 

1856
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:39,270
white table that is the union of two 
disparate territory's.

1857
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,521
Well,
the notion is,

1858
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:41,354
is that the male and the female want to 
with post to subordinate themselves to 

1859
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:47,590
the process.
The Christ represents smart,

1860
01:38:47,591 --> 01:38:50,520
smarter,
and Horace,

1861
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:54,540
et Cetera,
and in breath and Buddha.

1862
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:56,970
And why is that?
Well,

1863
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,560
because this person has,
you know,

1864
01:38:58,561 --> 01:38:59,394
their story and this person has their 
story and you didn't have the stores 

1865
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:07,770
produces a lot of unknown territory like
right away.

1866
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,440
And in order to mediate between the two 
can,

1867
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:12,090
you know,
higher order principle,

1868
01:39:12,091 --> 01:39:13,290
which says,
so that's the rule.

1869
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:14,250
So it's like,
okay,

1870
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,740
I'll negotiate with you,
but you have to trust me.

1871
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:17,574
And vice versa.
We have to put the possibility of trust 

1872
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,153
above all our dispute.
So you'd say what trust is one of the 

1873
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,020
aspects here,
et Cetera,

1874
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:25,873
et cetera.
So then we have a higher point of 

1875
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:29,340
reference to mediate or just be it.
So I'm saying,

1876
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:31,050
well,
this is one territory,

1877
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:31,893
this is another.
We need to find out what rules the 

1878
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:38,130
unexplored spaces in between so that 
when we get there we know how to act.

1879
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,273
Say
One more question about that similar 

1880
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:44,343
sort of thing.
What if the type of thing that you want 

1881
01:39:45,671 --> 01:39:46,504
to explore it isn't the type of thing 
that inherently precludes like there's 

1882
01:39:50,441 --> 01:39:51,880
sometimes the things that if I want to 
have it,

1883
01:39:51,881 --> 01:39:54,520
I must keep everyone else from having it
in order that I can have it.

1884
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,290
Yeah,
that's a zero sum game.

1885
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,670
Right?
And there are other sorts of things that

1886
01:39:57,671 --> 01:39:59,140
aren't that way.
Like for instance,

1887
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,203
if,
if I just had this dispute that I 

1888
01:40:02,981 --> 01:40:03,814
couldn't resolve with the Chinese,
astrophysics says I would not 

1889
01:40:05,861 --> 01:40:09,070
necessarily need to even knowledge that 
he was studying something.

1890
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,083
I mean I,

1891
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,480
well that's true.
Look it up on it.

1892
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,550
There are going to be like,
I wouldn't have to fight.

1893
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,580
This is your story and this is his 
story.

1894
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:22,380
You both established domains of reality.
Cosmo,

1895
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,050
cosmo's,
oh,

1896
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,903
the plural of that is to costs
as long as he's studying phenomena that 

1897
01:40:32,801 --> 01:40:35,260
are relevant to your pursuits.
But even if studying,

1898
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,500
again,

1899
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,500
that same thing,
I did not have to keep him from studying

1900
01:40:38,501 --> 01:40:39,660
it just so that I can study it.

1901
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:40,693
You not have to kill him as long as,
as long as the implications of what he 

1902
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:46,840
discovers have no negative significance 
for your ongoing story.

1903
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,120
That's,
that's,

1904
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,030
that's,
yeah.

1905
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,373
It seems like when you're

1906
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:51,383
like just solely to the physical world,
like in rivers and who's going to own 

1907
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:55,624
the valley,
then if you're not willing to cooperate 

1908
01:40:57,461 --> 01:40:59,560
and you're not going to give up your 
goal and you have to kill them.

1909
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,723
But if it's an abstracted thing,
like you're not studying a particular 

1910
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:05,440
tree yours,
but you're just studying a concept.

1911
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:08,603
Yeah.
And even if he wants to stay in the 

1912
01:41:09,091 --> 01:41:10,710
exact same bit of territory,

1913
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,910
well he don't make that argument about 
limited territory too all the time.

1914
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:17,910
Cause they say because there's some 
economists to basically follower,

1915
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:23,420
which population theorist who said we 
were all destined to starve my office.

1916
01:41:24,761 --> 01:41:25,594
Yeah.
There's somebody coming in a suit taken 

1917
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:27,004
both thoseand perspective,
which is that everything is a zero sum 

1918
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:29,704
game.
And so the competition for resources as 

1919
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:32,140
necessary.
And there's others who say,

1920
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:32,974
well no,
that's not true because you redefined 

1921
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:37,690
territory by transforming your adaptive 
structure.

1922
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,524
And that means that what may look like 
bounded territory is only bounded 

1923
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:42,004
because of the way that you approach it.
And if you think of a new way to 

1924
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:44,764
approach it,
well then there's plenty of resources 

1925
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:46,744
for all.
And so far the [inaudible] ones I think 

1926
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:49,684
are winning the argument,
which is to say that territory is 

1927
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:52,954
defined by your behavior in it,
not by any objective aspects of the 

1928
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:56,524
territory.

1929
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,420
So,
you know,

1930
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:58,253
he was a jury of distinction between 
over goods and really these are really 

1931
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,760
structures of belief.
Uh,

1932
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:07,050
I mean it seems like you can,
I would say,

1933
01:42:07,051 --> 01:42:09,330
I would say not,
not usually,

1934
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:14,331
because what constitutes a good,
it's always construed in relationship to

1935
01:42:15,631 --> 01:42:18,900
the pursuit of a goal.
It's like we fight wars over oil and the

1936
01:42:18,901 --> 01:42:19,734
20th century,
but we wouldn't fight wars over oil and 

1937
01:42:22,621 --> 01:42:23,454
the 19th century because the effect of 
the effect of Valence of petroleum has 

1938
01:42:27,001 --> 01:42:30,600
shifted as a consequence of a shift and 
in our environmental structure.

1939
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,270
So and that's a natural good,
so to speak,

1940
01:42:33,271 --> 01:42:35,820
but like I don't buy the concept of 
natural resource,

1941
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:36,923
I think.
I think there's a real flawed logic 

1942
01:42:38,251 --> 01:42:39,084
somewhere there because natural resource
plays the same role in economic theory 

1943
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,490
as stimuli does in psychology.
I mean suddenly they were like,

1944
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:48,870
we agree that oil is a good and so we're
fighting over it.

1945
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:49,763
Yeah.
That's then just say that I look at the 

1946
01:42:51,961 --> 01:42:52,794
world in such a way that I don't think 
the world very differently out of the 

1947
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:57,203
world in such a way that your way of 
looking at the world is inherently a 

1948
01:42:59,371 --> 01:43:01,620
threat to it because it's different from
my,

1949
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:06,090
from mine and so it's not exactly that 
we can compromise.

1950
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,810
We have to come up with some integrative
principal.

1951
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:10,860
Right?
Absolutely.

1952
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,400
That's why it was taking dispute 
fighting over oil.

1953
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:16,230
It seems to me,
yes.

1954
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,690
I would say yes because we can't.
In other words,

1955
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:24,120
we have to get to some other level so to
speak.

1956
01:43:24,121 --> 01:43:24,954
Yeah.
We should do that with the fight over 

1957
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:28,830
oil too,
because there should be a higher,

1958
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:29,903
theoretically at least there might be a 
higher order set of principles to which 

1959
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:36,030
we would be willing to subordinate our 
competition for oil.

1960
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:36,983
Yeah,
I mean,

1961
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:38,680
and it seems,
I don't think it's not,

1962
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:43,800
I don't think it's unreasonably Utopian 
to presume that in the long run it would

1963
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:47,490
be better if we could get as much as 
possible for everyone.

1964
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:49,770
It would be like from the selfish 
perspective,

1965
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:53,820
better like think it was a historically,
enormously van,

1966
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:57,470
for example,
that the Americans rebuilt Japan instead

1967
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,330
of burning into the ground and plowing 
you down.

1968
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:00,164
You're with salt,
which is your more standard human 

1969
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:03,740
response to demolish,
demolished enemy.

1970
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,530
And it was the same Mikey said about 
Germany,

1971
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,513
but the addition of Japan to the world 
economic power strikes me as a net 

1972
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:15,911
benefit even to the victors evil,
which was a well union.

1973
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:20,210
Well that plus the Japanese are online,
so to speak.

1974
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:21,044
We have access to the creative 
intelligence of an additional several 

1975
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,380
hundred million people or however many 
people inhabit Japan.

1976
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,380
So that's,
it's not a zero sum game.

1977
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:33,800
There's no necessary reason to construe 
it as a zero sum game.

1978
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:36,710
It can be played that way,
but it's,

1979
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:40,550
I think it's an error so that eliminates
the known,

1980
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:44,540
the notion of the distinction between 
like limited resources and ideas because

1981
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,280
resources are ideas.

1982
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:47,483
Let's see.
When I look at,

1983
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,650
I mean I think I do,
so I see this danger that you're in.

1984
01:44:49,651 --> 01:44:51,390
Couldn't get any theologies and fight 
wars over them,

1985
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:52,920
but on the other hand,
to me they seem,

1986
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,173
it seems to present a more optimistic 
playing field because just if we have 

1987
01:44:57,331 --> 01:45:00,590
this drive to explore that must be so 
satisfied and we want,

1988
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,730
we want to explore the physical 
environment.

1989
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,333
We must fight.
We must either cooperate or fight 

1990
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:08,483
because if there's one object and that 
there aren't duplicate copies of it and 

1991
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:13,090
only one person can explore it,
I must,

1992
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:14,063
yeah,
I see what I can both explored 

1993
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:17,540
independent,
well that don't even need to talk.

1994
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:18,703
I always,
the farm with the space race was good 

1995
01:45:20,461 --> 01:45:23,160
for that for precisely that reason.
It's a great,

1996
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,690
it's a great outlet for necessary 
explored very Tennessee.

1997
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,910
It would not necessarily,
I see what you mean.

1998
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,520
Yeah.
I haven't been saying all along.

1999
01:45:32,521 --> 01:45:33,354
And the whole point of abstraction and 
sort of in terms of evolutionary 

2000
01:45:35,641 --> 01:45:39,180
development is so that you can figure 
out what's good and bad without actually

2001
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:41,340
going out there and getting slaughtered 
by it's bad.

2002
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:42,820
So therefore,
and the,

2003
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:46,170
our whole cultural system is being 
extracted so that you can have,

2004
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:47,860
you can do these things where it hasn't 
actually,

2005
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,803
but it has a very,
the problem with it is that it has this 

2006
01:45:50,701 --> 01:45:52,200
attended a danger that we haven't 
discussed,

2007
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:56,310
which is the Tam Cascade.
You can also blow your whole system.

2008
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:57,173
It's like that's,
I think that's what we did with the 

2009
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,570
site.
I guess I should some smell.

2010
01:46:00,571 --> 01:46:01,404
It's not quite three.
When the scientific revolution came 

2011
01:46:04,231 --> 01:46:05,064
about,
the discoveries of the scientific 

2012
01:46:06,391 --> 01:46:07,224
revolution in abstract form seem to 
contradict the presumptions of the 

2013
01:46:11,101 --> 01:46:14,700
religious systems upon which we erected 
are a deputational structures.

2014
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:18,840
So the consequence of abstraction was 
that we could destroy our belief systems

2015
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:20,940
and that brought on an existential 
crisis.

2016
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:21,774
So the problem with abstraction is yes,
you can explore the abstract is very 

2017
01:46:25,111 --> 01:46:25,944
powerful.
But you can also be undermined really 

2018
01:46:27,661 --> 01:46:28,494
easily by words.
So what another reason it's really 

2019
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:35,130
useful to study your theology I think is
because it gives your ideology,

2020
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,083
your necessary believe that kind of from
ground they can no longer be your mind 

2021
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:43,260
easily by a few casual words.
Cause you're north,

2022
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:47,010
you're no longer.
If you think about it as a tree,

2023
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:53,980
you're way up here in the branches,
you haven't got the foggiest clue what's

2024
01:46:53,981 --> 01:46:56,380
down here.
It's all unconscious so to speak,

2025
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,710
which is to say it's all procedural.
Lord still embed images.

2026
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,100
Somebody would come along and give you a
bit of harassment here and it blows your

2027
01:47:03,101 --> 01:47:06,250
whole adoptation we'll structure apart.
You hate that.

2028
01:47:06,251 --> 01:47:07,570
I mean it's,
it's very hard on you.

2029
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,870
But that's mostly because you don't know
what's down here.

2030
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,200
So your house is built on shifting sand,
no one on the rock.

2031
01:47:14,201 --> 01:47:15,460
And the point is you're supposed to 
this,

2032
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:18,340
this ties in with the philosopher's 
stone inventory that we'll get to in the

2033
01:47:18,341 --> 01:47:19,174
second half of the course.
But the idea is that you're supposed to 

2034
01:47:20,591 --> 01:47:21,424
build your house on a rock.
And the point is you have to figure out 

2035
01:47:22,931 --> 01:47:24,840
what that rock is.
And that's,

2036
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,910
that's part of the reason why we're 
spending so much time to discussing this

2037
01:47:27,911 --> 01:47:28,744
pattern of adaptation.
Because if you know that in your belief 

2038
01:47:31,091 --> 01:47:31,924
system is description of the process by 
which belief systems are generated and 

2039
01:47:35,951 --> 01:47:37,960
that's the thing that you need to do 
above all else,

2040
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:41,650
well it makes you much more resistant to
casual disruption of your,

2041
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:42,933
of your adaptations structure.
Cause you know what you should do when 

2042
01:47:45,851 --> 01:47:46,684
you don't know what to do,
which is the thing you need to know the 

2043
01:47:48,431 --> 01:47:49,264
most.

2044
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,820
So
they're reading.

2045
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,590
Oh,
that's a good question.

2046
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,340
The simple answer would be yes.
Let me see.

2047
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:06,590
Well you use the abuse of history is 
pretty short.

2048
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,350
The basic writings of nature.
No,

2049
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,223
you don't have to read all that.
Read beyond good and evil as much of it 

2050
01:48:11,721 --> 01:48:13,460
as you can.
It's very difficult to read.

2051
01:48:13,461 --> 01:48:14,294
But,

2052
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,100
but it's very useful.
The great mother.

2053
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,353
Well look are the reason that I signed 
the great mother is because it's the 

2054
01:48:22,451 --> 01:48:23,284
most comprehensive survey I know of.
The symbolism of novelty basically of 

2055
01:48:27,221 --> 01:48:28,054
the great mother.
And what you should do is go through it 

2056
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:32,900
and get familiar with what it is that 
new saying.

2057
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,050
Basically all he's doing is saying,
well,

2058
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:37,173
there's a sim.
He thinks it's the collective 

2059
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:39,274
unconscious by the way,
which is right in a sense there's a 

2060
01:48:43,751 --> 01:48:45,130
domain,
it's the unknown.

2061
01:48:45,131 --> 01:48:47,260
It has a positive side,
the negative side.

2062
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:52,320
Here's the symbols that have accumulated
around that domain in representation.

2063
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:53,823
If you read that,
like go through it enough so that you 

2064
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:58,510
get a feel for the language of the 
symbols,

2065
01:48:58,511 --> 01:48:59,344
which basically means you have to 
understand when you see the statue of 

2066
01:49:02,381 --> 01:49:03,214
Diana who has a multitude of breasts,
you have to understand what that image 

2067
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:09,430
signifies,
how when you see Kelly who has,

2068
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:11,950
who's eating someone she's giving birth 
to,

2069
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,060
you have to be able to see it.

2070
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:13,893
No one has a foreign artifact but as a 
representation of something that you 

2071
01:49:16,061 --> 01:49:18,160
understand,
so you have to read that book and a half

2072
01:49:18,161 --> 01:49:18,994
until you get the language.
The reason for that is because unless 

2073
01:49:21,851 --> 01:49:24,160
you can,
unless you understand those mythological

2074
01:49:24,161 --> 01:49:24,994
representations,
you have no idea how terrifying the 

2075
01:49:28,751 --> 01:49:29,584
thing is that you want to avoid.
Because in normal circumstances it are 

2076
01:49:34,121 --> 01:49:34,954
well protected existences.
We never ever encounter anything but 

2077
01:49:37,841 --> 01:49:40,960
scares us badly enough to let us know 
how scared we could be.

2078
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:43,720
If you look at these mythological 
representations,

2079
01:49:43,721 --> 01:49:44,554
you can get an abstract notion of how 
terrifying territory really is and it's 

2080
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:52,690
very useful.
Get instant insight into other,

2081
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,570
into the artistic productions of arcade 
cultures.

2082
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:58,050
So,
and uh,

2083
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:00,820
the origins and history of 
consciousness.

2084
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:06,420
Well
that's basically the best book that I do

2085
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:08,080
have.
It describes hero mythology.

2086
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:08,923
So again,
you have to go through these enough so 

2087
01:50:10,391 --> 01:50:14,200
that you get the gist of what the 
authors are trying to,

2088
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:20,190
are trying to describe.
In the great mother Newman describes the

2089
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:24,430
symbolism of north in the origins and 
history of consciousness.

2090
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:28,330
He describes the symbolism of the 
process that explores novelty.

2091
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:29,493
So again,
you want to get a picture of it cause 

2092
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:34,300
then you'll start understanding 
references to heroes and so on.

2093
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:35,850
As we,
as we proceed through that,

2094
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:39,490
through the divorce or these ordering?
No,

2095
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,170
not really.
Not really.

2096
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,673
Not really.
